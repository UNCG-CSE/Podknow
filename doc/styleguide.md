# Style Guide
## Classes
- Class names follow UpperCamelCase.
- Avoid using class names that're too wordy or not descriptive.
- First lines of every class begins with package declarations.

## Comments
- Comments should be descriptive and readable.
- Comments referencing code should precede the code and not exist on the same line.

## Methods
- Arrange methods in order of execution or relevance.
- Never be more than 30 lines long. Use helper methods or create util methods when necessary.
- Instance methods (methods executed by an object) should have "self" as first argument.

## Variables
- Use camel case naming.
- Variable should be descriptive.

## Constants
- All caps.

# Misc
- Keep dangling whitespace to minimum; two blank lines can separate methods
