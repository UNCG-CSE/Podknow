Tasks: LDA model using bigrams – Compare and contrast results of bigram models with models built using the entire corpus 

Ask the question: “How do bigram models compare with models built from the whole corpus?” to determine nuances and greater details in topics.

To answer this question, I built an LDA model from exclusively bigram input to provide a greater clarity into the topics discussed, as many topics can be more accurately represented using word pairs. 

The outcome provided greater insight into the topics discussed by giving additional nuance that single words did not provide. 
The implications of these results will allow us to more accurately determine topics discussed by analyzing bigrams.

Tasks: Random Forest Regression Model - Predict outcome of confidence scores of a transcript based on it's word count.

The question: Can we predict the confidence score of a transcription based on the word count?

I trained a random forest regression model using 1600 samples of word count : confidence score data. Testing the word counts with the remaining 400 samples, we can see a clear trend that resembles the original plotted output. It's hard to predict confidence scores lower than 0.80 and we cannot predict that samples with lower word count can also produce very high confidence scores. A different methodology may be required.

Tasks: LDA Model for Words - LDA Model for Words Using SciKit - Categorization of Topics (In Progress)

The question "What are the topics of each podcast?" was asked due to the goal of the project being to find the content of each podcast based on things other than genre. 

In order to solve this question LDA models were created in order to give us an understanding of the topics in each podcast as well as the words that make up those topics.

The outcomes of these LDA models are more apparent in the slides of Progress Report 3, however we were able to visualize the data from the topic model as well as find the most dominant topics from each podcast among other things. 

The outcome for the categorization will be to have each of the topics labeled based on the words that are found within them. This will allow us to better understand the topics in each podcast as well as lead to better visualization.
