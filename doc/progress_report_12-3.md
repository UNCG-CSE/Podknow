Tasks: LDA Model for Words - LDA Model for Words Using SciKit - Categorization of Topics (In Progress)

The question "What are the topics of each podcast?" was asked due to the goal of the project being to find the content of each podcast based on things other than genre. 

In order to solve this question LDA models were created in order to give us an understanding of the topics in each podcast as well as the words that make up those topics.

The outcomes of these LDA models are more apparent in the slides of Progress Report 3, however we were able to visualize the data from the topic model as well as find the most dominant topics from each podcast among other things. 

The outcome for the categorization will be to have each of the topics labeled based on the words that are found within them. This will allow us to better understand the topics in each podcast as well as lead to better visualization.
