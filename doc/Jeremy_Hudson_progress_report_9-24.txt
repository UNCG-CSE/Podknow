Since many podcasts were not accompanied by official transcripts, I looked into several methods to procure transcripts for podcasts that didnâ€™t have any. These included finding the automatically generated YouTube transcripts, having speech recognition done in real time by having the podcast play in the background while being transcribed by Google Docs speech recognition, and our final solution that we intend to use from now on: the Google Speech to Text API. We settled on this API because it supported Python, and given the work that many of my other teammates are doing it would be possible to use it as a part of a fully automated system that acquires Podcast IDs, downloads them, converts them to a necessary audio file type (in our case .FLAC) and automatically writes the resulting transcript from the API to a text file. To set the API up I had to pip install the Google Cloud module, which I imported to my initial GoogleRequest.py file. For our initial test run, I manually converted all podcast mp3 files to FLAC files for API transcription. After this I setup my Google Cloud storage and uploaded the converted FLAC files to my cloud storage and successfully transcribed the bulk of my assigned thirty-three podcasts this way.
