exciting news before we start the show we are doing a live taping of our podcast at the Warner Theater in Washington DC on November 8th go to NPR presents. Org to get your tickets now now let's talk about that democratic debate in Texas that was hosted by ABC News hey there it's the NPR politics podcast I'm Tamara Keith I cover the White House campaign and Ayesha Rascoe I also wish that is Houston Zone Beyonce Knowles instead of our regular theme music and the time now is 11:23 p.m. on Thursday September 12th 3rd democratic debate just ended a bit ago and I'm here in studio in DC with Ron Hey Ron where are you right now so I'm looking down over the debate room it's in a gym on campus and I am on the little indoor running track hovering above the gym looking down on all the spin so it's a lot of mess but you don't want a lot of mess great about a messy bedroom is there are more clothes on the floor to dampen the sound and make it sound more like a studio Tim you are such a journalist that you felt the need to say Knowles when you said that was Beyonce Knowles thought it was Beyonce Smith alright so we are all here tonight to break down the key moments from this the third democratic debate but first let us do our traditional Thing by running through all of the candidates who are on the stage in order of their speaking time is Isha yes so at the very top but this is just time wise speaking TimeWise former Vice President Joe Biden and he clocked in at 17 minutes 8 seconds and right behind him came Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who clocked in at 16 minutes 38 seconds so after them and kind of descending order you have Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders California Senator Kamala Harris New Jersey senator Cory Booker South Bend Indiana mayor Pete buttigieg former HUD secretary hulyan Castro Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar former Texas congressman O'Rourke and businessman Andrew Yang clocked in at the very end with 8 minutes 1 second all right so Ron Scott Aisha this is the third of these debates what was Ronnie ulcer with you what was your big take away from this unlike the first two rounds of these debates even though there were 10 people on stage still the way it was structured the candidates each had a little bit more time to talk a little more time for interchange Clarity it seems like and more healthy energy and there was more energy was a slightly more positive energy with one or two exceptions almost all the candidates had some strong moments and Elizabeth Warren I'll help themselves distinctively tonight I didn't think hulyan Costco on balance although we had some strong moment will come out of this stronger or Andrew Yang or frankly Kamala Harris who continues to disappear perhaps in comparison to her one strongest performance in the first round of the debate almost everything wrong with Ron I have too many thoughts like Amy Klobuchar I'm going to reject the premise of your question inside my own thoughts first of all I think that this was kind of a status quo today I don't think anything to that tonight really shook up the debate or really massively changed any of these candidates fortunes I think one really notable thing is that this evening show that Joe Biden has really affected the conversation about health care for months and months Bernie Sanders really set the tone for healthcare was do you agree with Bernie or disagree with Bernie and most candidates said that I agree with Bernie or at least big chunks of what burn he's trying to do when it comes to Medicare for all mad at in some forms a big deal going away with Private health insurance over the last couple months Joe Biden his really frame that as blowing up Obamacare I'm doing the Affordable Care Act and saying I'm the one who how to build on Obamacare other people want to tear it down so it was interesting to me that tonight Joe Biden made that point on stage saying she's with Bernie but I'm with Obama speaking about Warren support for Sanders plan but then seeing so many of the other candidates make pains to say thanks Barack Obama I think Barack Obama took a big first step I really appreciate it with Barack Obama did and then a criticized aspects of Sanders plan to clearly I think many candidates are saying Joe Biden might have a point here that voters are latching onto and I need to moderate my health care physician just a little bit take away but that you know and pasta Bates there was a time some distancing from former President Obama in this debate there was so much embracing of President Obama says she's for Bernie well I'm for Barack to President Obama so I want to give credit first to Barack Obama former is something that Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning of Barack Obama and you're not a. Of course is a famous line from President Obama's first election campaign it was his whole theme Aisha what he was how aggressive Joe Biden was into me this was one of the first debates where he really seem to act as if you were the front runner in the other one especially in that first one which I think most people greed was not a strong performance for Joe Biden he he kind of lean back a bit but in this one he was aggressive there were moments I am really just trying to set the tone instead of just responding you know he went after Bernie Sanders when it came to the healthcare debate saying oh you think that I want employers don't have to provide health care or aren't providing Healthcare that they're just going to give those savings back to the employer's what type you know you're you say you're a socialist you have a lot of faith in the private sector I'm paraphrasing and then also just when he he obviously have that moment in the first debate where he wouldn't go over the time limit and he said I'm done he stopped himself but in this one he was like I'm going for everybody else is doing it and he kept going so I ask that to me stood out he definitely had more energy we don't want to talk about low energy he had he had more energy in this debate imagine imagine being out there on the in the ring and having everybody directly most of their negative energy mostly towards Biden and having all the tension that goes with one of these event and being on your feet like that for 3 hours that would test anyone let alone someone was 377 one of the areas where he was particularly aggressive on policy was Healthcare and earlier we heard a little clip where he made a comparison for Bernie I'm for Barack let's hear a bit more of that I think we should have a debate on Healthcare I think I know that the senator says she's for Bernie well I'm for Barack I think the Obamacare work I think the way you know if we add to it replace everything has been cut at a public option guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance and the senator he is referring to is Senator Elizabeth Warren who supports a version of medicare-for-all or actually just Medicare for all but when she was asked specifically about what will this mean for middle-class taxes she did you know a bit of a boxing move and jumped out of the way what's families have to deal with is cost total cost that's what they have to deal with and understand families are paying for their Healthcare today families pay every time an insurance that me says sorry you can't see that specialist insurance company says sorry that doctor is out of network sorry we are not covering that prescription question of course here was are you going to raise taxes and of course the answer is this inevitably yes but she is saying let's look at the total picture family is going to be better off their costs overall are going to be lower and if they are paying a little more intact look at the people who are going to be paying a lot more attacks and let's talk about the big corporations and let's talk the very richest taxpayers we're really going to go after them as for the middle class while we'll have to chip in more in taxes but they'll save so much more in there other cost that's the pitch but but she didn't say that explicitly though and I was struck by how they were trying to get her on that point and she just wouldn't say that they taxes what are the moments that stands out from this debate was sort of healthcare adjacent and that they were talking about health care but it really seemed like former HUD secretary Leon Castro was looking for an angle to go after bite my plan would do that your plan would not have to buy in they do not have to buy it you just said that 2 minutes ago you just said 2 minutes ago that they would have to buy it you said they would have to buy it to buy in if she qualifies somebody you forgetting what you said too many to be in for I forgot it already what you said just 2 minutes ago yet that reaction kind of set it all when he said that did you just forget what you just said in every other or I think it's notable that nobody else followed Castro's lead and Castro drop that after that first packet for that did not return to that line of attack he may not have meant it to be quite so blunt a reference to his age with the audience in the audience reaction made it very clear how everyone took it so whether he meant it or not that's the way it goes into the book Castro has shown that he thinks through most of the things he does he is pretty upfront about the political calculation that he puts into a lot of his actions I have a debate question which is in the first debate Kamala Harris came in with her planned at the fight that she was going to have with Joe Biden and Julio Castro clearly came into this debate out to have a fight with Joe Biden I know that initially the thought was that Kamala Harris really excelled in that fight with Biden but in the end I don't know does it actually work and I sense that I've talked to a lot of Voters were like you know I thought she was really mean to Joe did not work in the long run because while she got a big spike and a lot of people noticed her and she sold that attack on him on busing very well and it was a real vulnerability to a long-standing vulnerability of Joe Biden's so she was really hitting up a soft point this thing tonight seemed a little bit more like a cheap shot especially given the audience reaction and sewing buttigieg jumped into to be critical of a tentative innocence implicitly defend Biden cancer becoming on watchable everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington that's what they went on they just moved on and there did not seem to be an opportunity for him to benefit as there was for comparison that first day we are going to move on and take a break and when we come back Beto O'Rourke Kamala Harris foreign policy

new episode from NPR on saving for college by subscribing to life kit all gods and we're back and I want to start with Kamala Harris she is the senator from California and it seems like she came into tonight's debate with one mission in mind and that was to entice President Trump to tweet at her man behind the curtain the bottom line is Donald Trump in office Entre policy you know he reminds me of that that guy in The Wizard of Oz you know when you pull back the curtain it's a really small dude and that was not her only time going after President Trump win the debate it seems like every single time she spoke she was like let me turn this around with her at her opening statement was she said I'm directly address President Trump who I know is watching and actually he was giving a speech to Republicans and Baltimore speech illegal TiVo it seemed like the strategy for this one was yes to get Trump to maybe notice her strike out at her or on Twitter but also trying to make this distinction that look Trump is a person we need to go after and that's always been the question during these campaigns like how much do you want to make it about Trump and so what she seemed to be trying to say is we want to be Trump none of this matters I think she did say none of this matters if we don't beat them and so I'm the person to do that's what she was trying to do the of course we will debate whether it was successful yeah yeah I think she was almost trying to say like we can fight amongst ourselves but really we should just fight the other guy maybe the one behind the curtain sometimes be a great unifying strategy just didn't seem to catch tonight I want to turn to Beto O'Rourke and more broadly the issue that he has really taken up since the mass shooting in El Paso in Dayton and later in West Texas he he has made that the centerpiece of his campaign trying to get gun legislation and and making other changes and in particular he is gone out farther than many other Democrats in the field calling for not just a ban on new sales of assault style weapons AR-15 but a mandatory buyback basically taking the guns away 15 year old girl who was shot by an AR-15 mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that an AR-15 in Odessa and Midland to weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time he'll yes we're going to take your AR-15 or AK-47 and that's the closest I came to cursing we should say it's a tricky issue and it may be why O'Rourke is so out on this and other people may not be joining him is because NPR had a pole the NPR PBS NewsHour Marist poll that came out earlier this week and what they found was that support for actual BuyBacks is really mixed so overall only 45% of people are supporting BuyBacks and then now Democrats do supported more you have 70% supporting yet Republicans 23% but that was Independence who you're probably going to want to win that only 40% support these by back so this is something where there isn't outside of the democratic base there doesn't seem to be widespread support among house Democrats they don't have a clear consensus on anything beyond background checks are not really ready to go for an assault weapons ban even among house Democrats looking for what they can get through the Judiciary Committee and through the house floor they know they won't get anything through the Senate of course but just deciding what they're unified position is in the house so it is very hard to imagine that this is going to be the the The Cutting Edge of of the democratic platform but maybe it will and certainly incidence of the kind that have been suffered in El Paso so many other cities midland-odessa in Texas just in the last few weeks have changed the conversation President Trump talks about other scary Democrats they want to take your guns away what he's talking about is Beto O'Rourke and and people who would support a mandatory gun buyback that is going to be a popular view among not only Trump Republicans but also many Independents in this debate and lo and behold it did come up in this debate one of our predictions was correct you know every once in awhile we have just had this extraordinary phenomenal spectacle of watching the President say you know I had a secret meeting coming up at Camp David to settle that whole Afghanistan war thing and I called it off because one of our soldiers got killed clearly they were going to have to get around to talking a little bit about foreign policy tonight and they did talk about Afghanistan that did talk of course about Iraq was another occasion for Joe Biden to have to do a dance about how he voted for the Iraq War and he calling on authorization for the use of military force and didn't think it was really going to lead to a war and we've heard it all before but it was another moment for biting to be vulnerable he was difficulty talking tonight about something that he told the NPR politics podcast he had said he had voted for it to authorize the war in order to give President Bush Leverett but that he had begun to oppose the war the moment that bomb started dropping the moment that it began well that just wasn't true abiding didn't really fully opposed the war until about two years later and he addressed that discrepancy tonight I said something that was not meant the way I said that I said from that point on what I it was argued against in the beginning front once he started to put the troops in was that in fact we're doing the wrong way there was no. But I can assume was a larger focus of the conversation in the debate and is more present in a lot of people's minds because of what Ron talked about with the president potentially negotiating with the Taliban at Camp David and then scrapping it ayusha they were asked what would you do what do they say how many of the candidates were basically saying that it's time for the US to get out of Afghanistan that the the war has gone on too long in particular warned the said that she would pull out the troops even without a deal we need to bring our troops home and then we need to make a big shift not ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily threat to the United States originating in Afghanistan here we are just a few days after the 18th anniversary of 9/11 which was planned and largely put together in Afghanistan as long as we can be assured that that couldn't happen again and we had the suppression of that kind of terrorist activity we didn't really need to tell Afghanistan what kind of government it was going to have any more it and we could leave that part of the world that seem to be the basic trust Pete buttigieg who is actually served in Afghanistan wanted to make that point and also wanted to say that we shouldn't be looking at any of our troops and telling them that we're not going to stand with them and that we are not going to be committed to the things we send them into the field to die for so as with every debate there were a lot of things weren't covered and there are a few stray moments that I feel like we should probably talk about one of those was Vice President Biden in a very long answer about schools in segregation he started talking about a turntables make sure the kids here word a kid coming from a very poor School. Very poor background will hear 4-minute words you were spoken by the time I get there it is a very real point about making sure your kids here a lot of words that isn't that is an important issue that kind of came from there like questions about that because it said that like poor people are people on welfare their kids here like Millions last words and there's a question about whether that's actually the case but yes you should talk to your kids it's important I hearing everything for my poor children they like their whole lives are like one NPR politics podcast and now we're eating bananas bananas my daughter would make the same complaint or calling Kelsey Snell making fun of this and as soon as I hit send I regretted Kelsey's actress somebody probably would have a record player at five minutes later she was like I have a record player fires are cool again their back and I know our bosses are listening so I will say that this does not take up too much mental energy on debate nights but I'll debate nights I've got a side passion project and that is and that is hashtag debate dogs started in 2016 during the the general election debates Sam Sanders and I just at one point when they were really grim and really toxic we are just like everybody stood a picture if you give your dog is watching the debate is a picture of your dog watching the baton people did that and then when the first debate started up again this year a couple listeners remembered it and is it Jesus are you still doing the bait dogs and I was like you're right we are still doing the bait dog so every debate night I'd encourage people to tweet pictures of their dog watching the debate on TV with the hashtag debate dogs I retweet as many as I can when I'm course not working very hard focusing on my day job but late night job lot of great pictures came in if you have a dog and you watch the debate with them please join debate dogs next time around and I will just say I lost my phone earlier this year and that makes that makes these pictures that come in on my Twitter feed cuz I certainly have an entire column dedicated to this makes me really happy to see all the dogs especially beagles watching the debates and it was very telling that about halfway through this three-hour debate most of the dogs in the pictures were fast asleep that is rap for today we will be back as soon as there's political news that you need to know about until then join us on Facebook and our brand new Facebook group it's a place for you to connect with us and other podcast listeners just head to end.
