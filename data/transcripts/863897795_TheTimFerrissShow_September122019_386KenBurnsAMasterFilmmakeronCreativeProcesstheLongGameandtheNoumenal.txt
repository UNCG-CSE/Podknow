Of six months beginning Sunday September 15th so all that said without further Ado please enjoy in my God that I enjoy it this wide-ranging conversation with none other than Ken Burns Ken welcome to the show thanks for having me I am thrilled to be having this conversation I've been a fan of yours for effectively as long as I've been consciously aware of what I'm watching in front of me so I can't say the first few years but shortly thereafter and I thought we might Bounce Around quite a bit in this conversation and begin with something that came up in the research I did for this podcast episode and it relates to the Mentos in your pocket do you still carry mementos in your pocket and whether it's past tense or current tense present tense can you describe what those are and why you care to admit some change I have four items which I've had for many many years now they know no one's been retired one of them is a coin pump I buy an ex-marine who was the Headmaster at the Greenwood School in tiny Putney Vermont the Greenwood school is equally tiny and is in school for boys with learning differences meaning they suffer from dyslexia or ADHD or executive function the host of problems head-on it's been around for about 40 years and after Thanksgiving when the boys come back ages 10:11 to 17 when I come back from Thanksgiving vacation they are all asked to memorize the 10 complicated sentences of Lincoln's Gettysburg address and then publicly recycling it can be a nightmare and when the boys successfully complete that they they are given the coin by the Headmaster in typical kind of milk fashion even though it's not a military school and he's anything but militaristic but I was asked once many many years ago to be a judge I found myself in tears the effort of these boys to to do it and said Somebody's got to make a phone without it obviously would be a cinema verite Stone which is not my style but as the 50th anniversary of the Gettysburg address came up in 2013 I thought you know what I got to dive in and do it so we embedded in the school with us sound man and a cameraman and assistance and recorded 300 and some hours and when the whole thing was over here and we made the film and realize that the kids had never in the Zen 35 years history of the school been to Gettysburg I rented two buses then took the whole school there and put them up for a night and gave them a tour of the battlefield as the kind of Kota to this thump when it was over he keep calm down a metal in my pocket so I have that Greenwood school thing the oldest thing I have is what's called a feeling heart it's a stainless steel shape of a heart with a little indentation in it so you can shut a hold of them, it's not like a coin and it has a little bit more Dimension to that and it's maybe much bigger than the silver dollar and it was sent to me by a woman in Upstate New York and artist to its fashion this and she had written after the Civil War series was broadcast in September of 1990 and sometime in the first two that she had sent me a heart I then got another two hearts for my two oldest daughters and recently got two more cards to give to my two young daughters who are 14 and MMA and so it's it just is always there I can feel it and sometimes I find myself just holding it in my hand I'm sure doing exactly what she had intended the heart to do another object I have was given to me by a friend and it's a Minnie ball now polish them free of all the Catholic Education set a tensor the minie ball is the bullet that would have been used during the Civil War and it was found on the on Gettysburg as well as a reminder of the time when we came closest store near National Suicide when now it turns out to the work of Jew killed and Faust the former president of Harvard extraordinary scholarship that instead of the $600 620,000 that was generally accepted as the death toll in the Civil War it looks like it's more like 750,000 quarters of a million well more than 2% of the population and extraordinary death toll in the poem Casey At The Bat final object that I've carried around for years and years as a button off of jacket of a friend of mine and father his son gave it to me so friend of mine's grandfather as well war on an army uniform and he had landed at D-Day Normandy in my pocket and they're comforting but I do have one object that I can't fit in my pocket but I have next to me at my desk at home in New Hampshire and it's a leg irons that I purchased at auction heavy weighting horrible things they are a human invention whose only purpose is to keep other human beings in bondage which is a legacy of a very difficult part of our history and the Reckoning we still not as fully completed it turns out that though I don't necessarily go looking for it in my projects that that that question is always wondering in in in our American story and whether it's country music hits their whether it's in the national parks is there an unlikely places that they are unlikely places like a biography of Jackie Robinson or Jack Johnson or Jazz but it it seems to this question of the fact that we know we were born under the sign that all men are created equal but the guy who wrote that second sentence of the Declaration are Creed owns more than 200 means when he wrote it and didn't see the contradiction Northern hypocrisy and more important than to sit in this lifetime be free any one of those human beings who have any alignable lights and so you know if you're going to do a deeper dive and just beer nation of conventional wisdom then you have to deal with his ever-present subject to Grace and so I wish I could tell you that I could carry around others like irons but they don't fit in the pocket and they have a weight and a disturbing heaviness to them that that is never the last very close to me when I'm at home can you have a a remarkable memory and you also must receive the offer to be exposed to thousands of different objects that you could keep what you said as reminders earlier are there particular reasons why you chose of all the other options let's start with the objects in your pocket what is what purpose do they serve for you you're asking a question which requires an answer from the head and I'm not sure the head made the decision to keep them I think the heart dude and the heart doesn't necessarily have a rational or easily articulated response to the question which is a good one in an obvious one and I wish I could be truthful and and honestly I mean I do get lots of stuff objects and mainly these are things that are close to me I mean I never thought when I receive this feeling heart that I would put it in my pocket but I did instinctively in it never left I mean I can't tell you how many times I've emptied it to go through TSA screening so you know it's real and there's a kind of commitment and loyalty to it that that I can't explain and the bullet was given to me by a friend in me I adore him he is one of my closest friends and it changed he's a big bear of a loving man and I just sort of felt so you know there's something so contradictory about a bullet being anything but a bad thing and yet it it represents all of the totality of the Civil War the woman who had sent this feeling heart wrote in her letter that she saw the series that we made on the Civil War as an American Baha'i gavita you know what I don't think I was it was the flattery of that that stuck it in my pocket it was the something of it and it may have been the struggles that it took me to go to the grocery undergone obviously these kids at the Greenwood school had moved me to my core I just presume that some other filmmaker better equipped to do a cinema verite so I would do it but found myself having to do it and found myself with a crew that was really excited and and was able to get a lot of fly on the wall stuff and it meant a lot to me and the button is the button the button for the greatest invasion in human history took place on June 6th 1944 northwest coast of France that ended what ended in here like let's talk about I would like to talk about the heart and maybe that's almost a contradiction in terms but I have been very hyper analytical my whole life and I think if Nick elected to pay attention to signals from the body and I've been trying to cultivate this over the last few years in particular in a woman named Diana Chapman and Jim Detmer introduced me to this concept of the whole the whole body or the full body yes and I've read that at least in response to questions like when you start one of these big movies what's the first step that you talked about looking for the big hole hearted yes that isn't coming your head for your worst kind of like falling in love and so it what I've been trying to do is pay attention to the sensations whether it's heart center to work. Centered to assess whether something is a full yes for me what what does a full whole heart and when could you give us an example of a project where that was a clear signal I think the best example is the one for the right in front of us which is country music I had had country music as an intellectual didactic expository idea if that's what it was on a list that I've recently found from the 1990s another list from the Arts meaning that I was thinking about right and there might be two different things you know the lottery where they've got all these ping pong balls bouncing around in one drops down imagine these are all just completely arbitrary head things I just idea we should do this we should think about that what about this and say you're just want to write them down so you don't forget them in whatever but nothing happens and nothing did happen and I had forgotten in there but I remember visiting a friend of mine in Dallas Texas have been raising money for us wonderful dear friend and I came down for breakfast one day we done event thing is this house and I guess we were the first people up and he said you ever thought about country music and when he said it it was like this and I look at him and was just so I could feel it in my chest and I could feel it in my gut and so it wasn't I started to answer yes and then I realized that you asked was so feeble and so partial because it had to do with sort of trying to be oh yeah you like that that I realized reacts to that head completely obliterated what little blip it was as a kind of mental construct that had worked its way in the 90s and later the odds on the receipt of paper with 10 20 30 other subjects some of which I've done some of which I haven't done some of which I'll get through some of which I will never get too and so this was something else and so as I felt like I got down on one knee I didn't physically and proposed to country music at that it was a big ass the biggest thing I knew is that this project would have to go through one of my partners who I knew more about country music and more importantly he and I have been thinking about another big project and we're just throwing around some ideas and doing a little research and we were not in quicksand but we were on our back rear right tire is stuck and I went back to New Hampshire and I went to him and I said what about what about country music and it it like he looks at me like and the two of us but it if you know we haven't got anything we had written anything there been no budget raise for he was just early conceptual stuff it was dropped in favour of the next eight and a half years of work and it was a total this is wholeheartedness that's what it is it has to be the integration so that you you physically commit to it and you mentally commit to it that you're emotionally commit to it and that yes is very similar to the chemistry we feel with others when we fall in love either romantically or as friends and as a wholehearted yes because you realize that the story is the stories are firing on all cylinders at their come they represent Challenge and opportunity and difficulty in a group of students at least a million problems but I didn't think that the word problem was necessarily pejorative that it represented suction that needed to be overcome it was the necessary friction of the creative process of the making progress you know that wall won't hold the Builder you needed a Scaffolding in false work that once you reached a certain stage can be disassembled so this is what we going to be the encyclopedia you're not going to be there meaning of the telephone book How do you take something is monstrously big as the Civil War baseball or Chad for the national parks or World War II who were the Roosevelts in Vietnam right now country music and say what do we tell we're do we start how do we go back and pick up its ancestors weirdly ends how do we tell the stories mainly practical things that have to do with the craft of the article that came and larger big question things and all of that represents but if you look at them as as as as just whatever or Runner takes to overcome that brain that screaming stop as you're running a marathon then you understand what we're engaged in the people always come up and say why you just like the fact I'm talking to you as one of the palliative aspects of this promotional stuff from the airlock cheapest pair of creative process to leave the project because all of a sudden you've been attending to the stories we lift up and you begin to share with other people and they begin to synthesize them ideas and you know they're saying oh you intended this and me and you said no we didn't we just want to tell the story but now that you're saying this we realize the way in which these historical moment say resume in the President Harry Truman one said the only thing that's really knew is the history you don't know people are a Mark Twain is supposed to say that history is supposed to have said that history doesn't repeat itself but it Rhymes and if you did say that I believe that human nature doesn't change her crazy ass please put it this way you know there's nothing new Under the Sun that's the Old Testament and that may be the best what has been will be again what has been done will be done again there's no Under the Sun and so I think that that suggests that human nature doesn't change and that it's super imposes itself over the seemingly random chaos event we begin to perceive patterns and Echoes and themed run Twain would say and I love that we attend to the storytelling part of it I happen to work in American history that way somebody painter Works in oil as opposed to watercolor and fortunately the word history is mostly made up of the word story plus, why you know you don't have to get into binary his story or her story is just story plus High which is a wonderful greeting and you know we finish it and then we will come up and go my God it is resonating with the present and every single film I've done like you will look at country music and you cannot believe that we were editorially complete for the me-too movement started for the Vietnam War series that came out in 2017 so imagine where we'd been for the first nine months of 2017 and for the preceding election year and I said what if I told you that I had been working for 10 and 1/2 years about Mass demonstrations taking place all across the country against the current Administration about a White House in disarray obsessed with leaks about a president certain the Press was making up stories about him lying about asymmetrical Warfare that confounded the Mighty Mite of the US military about huge big document drops of stolen classified material into the public sphere that you stabilize the political equation and accusations that a political party reached out to a foreign power. the time of a national election to influence that election you would say I've been working on the last year-and-a-half for all of these things were true of the Vietnam War when I started in December of 2006 and were also true when we finished lock the picture no more work on it and in December of 2015 a month before the Iowa caucuses out of which Donald Trump was not supposed to emerge as a candidate that I worked on and it's nothing that were prepared for its only after the fact cut of collection of accounting that Bittersweet. When you get a chance to finish the film you don't want to leave it until you're obligated because of the shoe leather necessary to promote public broadcasting films you do in 40 cities and you the construct something that talks about how you related to it but it's true of every second every the Civil War and suggest that Wayne is absolutely correct that's one hell of a rhyme and I have a question about motivation you mentioned 8 and 1/2 years 10 plus years some people have signs in their office these motivational quotes of various types effectively some version of go get em tiger you can do it at Setter I have read that you have a neon sign in your editing room. What does it read and how did you choose this particular sign filmmakers are notorious for once something works you don't touch it find out new and contradictory fax near kind of obligated to to do it and we never have a set research. Followed by writing. Followed by the script that's now Richton stone that informs the shooting in the editing we never stop researching so we're always finding out stuff and we never stop writing so we're always corrigible and willing to be flexible in in what we do and we're often filming interviewing before we've even written a word of a script so that every time you see a talking head in our film it's a happy accident it's not that I've found you and it said hey could you please get me from paragraph to two paragraphs tree and episode 4 thank you thank you can you say that again but doing it with a little bit more economy was it but now could you end the way you did the first we've never done that we just go and have an interview and if it doesn't work it's our fault if it works are grapes try and so we have this complex process that I think serves as very well in the in the pursuit of a complicated story so what's the neon sign it says it's complicated and it's the license to say even if it's perfect even if it's working let's open it up and add in that set complicated constructing contradictory fact and sure it might be stabilized it but let's let's do it anyway and so it just says in cursive lowercase it's complicated other for a long time and it's sometimes like a scarf or a muffler warm gloves arms you against scariness of of going out into that unknown region at other times it's just like yeah this is what we do and I wanted it I finally immortalize it by putting it in me on so that we could all remember that this is what we celebrate that's said I remember making a film on the Statue of Liberty a Statesman Sol in which a wonderful interview and he was quoting judge Learned Hand could there ever be a better name for a Jewish than learning Han and apparently learning hand said Liberty is never being too sure you're right and I'm sure he meant it in a rather narrow political perhaps jurisprudence sense but I took it in a broad spiritual sense you know that the opposite of faith is not heresy it's 8 is not doubt it's it's just conviction right so Faith requires doubt it doesn't require it doesn't require certainty and and what we've tried to do is instill in ourselves which is the hardest thing to do too much easier to try to instill it in others that we're not done we got to open this up again we've learned contradictory stuff and we're in for a while our Vietnam notes for longer than expected self-help lyrics a four regiments of Vietcong for measurements of NBA went down the Ho Chi Minh trail that month and we have an asterisk footnote 117 and putting up 117 would say you know this Skyler says this this color says that this color says that because it's in these two places were going with for later on we found out after we lock the film that yet another Stellar had said 3:00 and we were beginning to feel a little bit more comfortable with that and would rather err the conservative side and so we change we found where the narrator has said the word 3 and we cannibalized it and moved it over sometimes been called a Frank and by and we put the tree in instead of the 4 so that we can just exhale a little bit no one would ever in a million years that even a scholar take us to task for us but that was not acceptable for us so we'd rather and if we haven't been able to find that that that tree we would have asked the narrator back into the coyote back in and and and recorded at the Civil War and maybe we could start with a question about some more just you give any idea how many people have seen have watched the Civil War do any estimates no idea I know you reached about 40 million people who watch summer all of it the first time is broadcast about this time 29 years ago in September 1990 and I know that in subsequent broadcast it's done very well it's you know it worked itself in the school's many many other people look at it regularly so I assumed it might be you know a couple multiples of of that original 40 million as it's going out astronomical huge huge numbers 20 + years ago television critics list some thought nobody would watch the Civil War free shooting that do Disney musical top rock was going to bug out of the water that didn't end up being the case and what would I wonder especially given the rich Brew just talking about faith and conviction and so on have you have you as someone who comes across saying and entry interview like this as completely confident and and clear in Focus have you ever felt lost or had self-doubt are there any stories that you can paint just to provide a video fleshed-out you in picture of you could you do about a difficult difficult a very very anxious person and I now don't have too much time for anxiety because people that I love are anxious now too and I've got to get my attention to them so the early games the first film on the Brooklyn Bridge through the Civil War agonizing every morning up at 4 a.m. I remember I asked how we fight about grants and he said Grant meaning u.s. Grant had what they call for in the morning courage that meant that you could wake him up at 4 in the morning and tell him the enemy a trend is left sign can he be is cool who lives in the morning courage and I think I've learned how to harness it and turn it around but it was rushing anxiety about whether this would work and I I was told while I was making the Civil War that yeah sure these first six films on the Brooklyn Bridge in the Shakers and Huey Long in the Statue of Liberty Congress and Thomas Hart Benton in an hour and a half an hour in length people will watch still photographs of that long but they're not going to look for the 5-1 hours that initially we propose the civil war debate and it ended up being nearly twelve hours in Mike's and that that was terrifying to be told that I knew the film was good when it was done but I remember arriving Los Angeles for the television critics association meeting and several of the critics would say terrific but you know nobody's going to watch it because of this cop Rock Show by Steven bochco or because we were in an age when people were addicted to MTV cutting and that the two and a half minutes was the length of the American attention span and I remember thinking wow that's too bad you know it was let it didn't loved ones and colleagues and sometimes they were both showed me up and pretended that I was okay or you know if it was too much really really important people still in my life to this day but I remember thinking that I thought that all real meaning of induration that the work will proudest of that your promise and I would presume that the relationships you care the most about have benefited from are sustained attention than that okay to have both that we do need the fast-paced fast cutting two-and-a-half-minute MTV music video Just as today as people or Kelly made during the odds that no one would watch the the the national parks of the World War II because you too but you know men that kitten with a ball of yarn that the stuff we cared about that all meaning of frayed induration was an important thing in what was Civil War I mean on baseball they said she jasso man nobody could have watched you know 18 hours of black people for the National Park Rodger in the if we should have your family stay at and so I just started trusting at some point along the way and I got I got to it's funny that you ask this because I've just been dealing it recently with loved ones I developed in the early to mid nineties three things I called him one of my daughters closing the three truths I'm not willing to elevate them to that I just called the three things that I try to do is I help others friends and and loved ones with anxiety of this debilitating kind that this will pass know all things are transitory get help from others and be kind to yourself and if I had to do a neon sign another neon sign I think I do but three things and I've learned to internalize them and in large measure because like that alcoholic or drug addict who becomes the most effective counselor somebody who's been through the wringer of it and I think I'm much better is a much more authentic spokesperson for the authenticity that is at the heart of these relatively Simple Songs better as the song writer Harlan Howard said three chords and the truth so it's acknowledging that there's a Simplicity to it doesn't have the sophistication of the complication of classical music or some jazz at at back at the truth it means it's dealing with universal human things I find the universality of those three things similar to the country song Charlie Pride says in the introduction that I think there's a country song for every mood you're in it might make you cry but you'll feel better for crying with a well he sounds to Bluetooth fly the midnight train is whining low I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry music which Wynton Marsalis says in this town and country music not just jazz is the art of the invisible the only nation of language are form of communication then you're mainlining a completely benign form of heroin emotional heroin right into your bloodstream and it gets there really quick and its effects of only positive Hank Williams I got a hot rod Ford and a $2 bill and I know a place right over the hill you know any goes on to talk about the joy of young love there's a possibility of new love in that just as he speaks you know the Silence of a falling star lights up a purple sky and as I wonder where you are I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry there's no one within the sound of my voice that has not experienced move to Austin Texas a few years ago and spent a lot of time on Willie Nelson Boulevard I saw him perform so I can perform recently at Austin City Limits and my I think my memory serves me right that he was part of the pilot for that Series in 1972 as it sits and it was just spectacular just absolutely spectacular some looking forward to digging into country music I did have a follow-up question on the three truths is your daughter calls them the third in particular be kind to yourself could yeah that's the hardest yeah it's hard for me to could you describe what that looks like for you are there any practices or things that you now say to yourself I already turned heads. I can I can talk myself down from the first thing I'm smart enough to surround myself with people that are willing to put up with doing what the second thing and but I am a complete failure on that last thing to I I can pay lip service to it only because I know it's true and it's therefore not phone is lip service it is a truth but I think this is the hardest thing for all of us is how to be kind to ourselves how do we how do we not murder this moment how do we how do we prepare ourselves for the next moment whatever it is until you try to liberate ourselves from the prison of the contemplation of the past was made from depression not to nut to deny the chemical of that nor anxiety which it is an anticipation of the future Thomas Jefferson had a wonderful thing how much pain has caused us the evils which have never happened and I didn't really surprise me that Tom a plantation and his comfortable life with due entirely to people that he owned and did not pay to realize too that these basic elements of the human heart have to do with worry when that is a great late 18th century or maybe he wrote it in the early 19th century commentary about worry how much pain has caused us a whole switch have never happened. Jefferson was was also a fan of Seneca the younger and under the philosophical School of stoicism this was George Washington who had play about Kato performs at Valley Forge to bolster the morale of the troops are there any ID you gravitate to any the up together or philosophies or philosophical writings if you're very clearly love What Jeffrey Ward who's my longtime riding collaborator along with it and Duncan Jeff has been writing a little bit longer and he wrote the Roosevelt and he was quoting Franklin Roosevelt when I asked him what his philosophy was he said he was a Christian and an American and left it at that and you know at the end of the day I'll hide behind FDR skirts you know I am I think Christian I'm not a practicing Christian but I'd like to believe that I'm a believing and that I'm in American and that basically says that I do not need to shoe to any one political philosophy because there's always me the the possibility and in fact it is in the possibility there's always the certainty that the opposite of what I might believe in my also be true and that requires the name of this of human that requires a human dexterity that binary aspects of politics don't subscribe to and that's why I think FDR said it exactly right then I have friends as close colleagues as possible who I guess would call them cells atheist and others who have other face in addition to Christianity but this is what I get I am what I am I think Pop I said and I like I like both so you know I like I like that American part you know it's for all the things that we've screwed up for all of the things we've gotten so long I do believe as Lincoln said in his message to Congress what we call the State of the Union in December of 1862 we were the last best hope of Earth that dismissive exceptionalism poisons that allows us to incubate to incubate so you know I I have spent my entire professional life living in a kind of space I like to think about it cleaning the two letter lowercase plural pronouns us and it's capitalized version of the US that is to say all of the intimacy and warmth of us along with Wii and Alan and all of the Bratz the Majesty the complexity the contradiction even the controversy of the United States and what I've learned over 40 plus years of practicing in my professional life telling stories in American history about us and the US is that there's only us there's no them country music has been since the very beginning an alloy a mixture of things stronger because it has constituent elements that make it stronger and that it any time in our history when we suggested pulling out one aspect of it will make it pure American you have a priori weekend the Ally and made it the riddle and more breakable and I like our supplements I like Hour Fitness I like our mungro message Lauren currents that are boiling and swirling in United States this is what makes us stronger it's a banjo one of the key instruments of country music is from Africa AP Carter of the Carter Family the original Carter family Bill Monroe the founder of Bluegrass aforementioned Hank Williams and Johnny Cash people who deserve to be on the Mount Rushmore of early country music all had an African-American tutor that took their chops from here to way up here to qualify them for consideration in that Pantheon on that Mount Rushmore and Jimmie Rodgers the first Superstar at the same time by the Carter Family song by The Black Train Cruise that he worked with in Southern Mississippi so while he didn't have one Mentor the way Hank Williams. Pain about something you said everything I learned about music I got some Rufus that's that's not bad for arguably the most important country singer superficial thing you've got about country music and your head whatever conventional wisdom that you think you're now a going to enjoin it ain't true that it's always been a mixture and it's always been mostly working class citizen story of women strong limits of the very very beginning of people coming out of poverty black and white and changing the Dynamics of their lies and if they didn't bring other people out they gave them at least the tools to Green how to do that it's about geographical dislocation and psychological dissociation then at the end of the day that's extraordinary marriage of this invisible art form combine with the Poetry of the words and the crust has filmmaker startling emotion we did not ever expect to find in the story of country music what to ask a question about the making of Ken Burns cuz you said I am what I am which is true you are what you are I can't deny that but I like my girlfriend said to me recently over dinner she was she was she was quoting someone else but she said that every every child is born into a different family in the sensitive two or three siblings as change over time you're born into different family and likewise I would imagine that there are certain aspects of Ken this that have remained the same for a long time but you made choices that have shaped who you are today and I wanted to ask about one in particular and this is Hampshire College could you could you talk about Hampshire describe Hampshire college and how you ended up there because I actually do not know okay so I I am the son of an anthropologist and a mother who had an advanced degree in biology but couldn't really use it she raised to sign is until she died of cancer in 1965 which is the dominant event of my life I'd seen the safe haven that it is provided for him a man who I'd never seen from not my mother's illness not at her death not at her funeral Point pointed out to me by phone that was in my senior year of high school in Ann Arbor Michigan and my best friend subscribe to a magazine that I've never heard of there was anything else but Time magazine for Newsweek powered by that time cover to cover and here was a description of a tiny experimental college that had just opened in the last few weeks this is October of 1970 and it opened in September of 1970 which was for lack of a better word a graduate school experience at an undergraduate level that is to say you were trusted to even know what you want to do or to find out what you wanted to do when you perceive him in much the same fashion you wouldn't graduate school with a d emphasis on class work and more emphasis on independent study and the assembling of your own examinations your own proposal and the assembling of A Faculty small faculty group of two or three would judge it along the way and finally pass on it pass or fail I like falling in love with country music I was supposed to go to the University of Michigan where I can get in for free or nominal stuff cuz my dad taught their bias Hampshire was the most expensive college on Earth room board and tuition in the fall of 71 to the class to which I hope to enter in was $4,730 $30 more than Harvard University basically moved all my chips I quit school early I had advanced placement courses that permitted me to interpret the Michigan laws it said I needed o x number of credits not four years of high school or three years of high school and that I had that and that I was leaving after Christmas and the guidance counselor said you were making a big mistake and I work in a record store part-time I now went full-time to that saved up money my grandmother gave me $1,000 I had inherited $1,000 I pushed all my chips in the year one fully intending to come back to Michigan just having you know blown it all that you know experiment by so fell in love with him sure I am so a poster boy for it that I couldn't not do it so I quit I took a leave from Hampshire my second year and worked literally as indentured servant to a dear friend still who ran the bookstore at the college and got enough money to pay for the next two years of Hampshire and still except for years I spent only three years actually matriculating there and ended up with a Bachelor of Arts and film study and design and I left there with this sort of naive and perhaps arrogant assumption that I could start my own film company rather than do what everyone else is supposed to do which is go to New York or LA or whatever big city in a princess and a thumb company work your way up so I started with two other Hansard Brad's Florentine films in 1976 the year after I graduated there we've been 12 I'm thinking about it for a long time and that's been my only employer meaning I've got the worst boss ever which is essential we had two teachers filming and photography teachers mostly still photographers social documentary still photographers in Jerome Reid when they became mentors in the best sense of the word almost in a medieval Renaissance sense of of a real master-student relationship and my relationship with Jerry leaving was complete through to the end of his life he died in 2011 I still worship him and all that he gave me I would he did not exist you would not be having this conversation I said that you know what once Dizzy Gillespie said of Louis Armstrong know him know me know Jerry leave I know me.. What are some of the things that stuck with you from Jerry or were imprinted on you that had such a tremendous impact or was it is care for you and how would you describe what was important he was a curmudgeonly tough guy I remember I was a precocious film students all through high school not having any formal courses to take but studying and reading and I knew stuff and I had a sentence which I think I can still do from Andrew star that's what a great critics and proponents of the French auteur theory that the director is the author of the film and he was talking about Nicholas Ray who made Rebel Without a Cause but he also made a film called Johnny Guitar who screenwriter was Philip yordan who is eventually blacklisted during those terrible Hollywood days in the 50s so there was a sentence that I had looked at as a perplexed and you'll understand exactly why are perplexed a teenager where it said Jordan set out to attack McCarthyism Ray was Too Delirious to pay any heed as Freudian feminism in Marxist masochism prevailed over pirandello transcended polemics that was my Holy Grail right so I finally got up a nerve second semester of Hampshire to I've been in a lane Mays his his colleagues and younger colleagues and somebody hit imported to Hampshire the year I came the second year he come the first year and I showed this sentence the office and I suddenly like just said blurted it out I was showing off site that not only had I memorize it but I think I knew what it meant like to have this discussion with him and when I look at me he got it from his desk and he walked around the desk and he took me by the elbow what you always did to everybody both an affectionate ways that this was clearly not an affectionate way he lifted me out of my chair me to the door open the door and push me out into the hallway and shut the door and I sat out there because Jerry I was known for this to being a terrifying Chris and I are all going out with this wonderful sentence which I was going to attempt to deconstruct and everything would be great and we're such as it is and I rarely use the word career after that would be launched and he had reminded me this was just absurd that Hollywood called itself make industry which ought to be warning and us and we were interested in something else he was a great great so photography hey Google we belong l i e b l i n g extraordinary photographs with cheap put up in our in our classes along with our photographs and and our films and they're stunning he was about to kiss you wanted us to know history he wanted us to know ethics you want us to be a humanist he understood that was there was an essential reciprocity that took place stuff didn't just listening part adjuster in classes Albany say my car is broken down can you drive into Northampton the next town over and I'll pick up the laundry said sure and along the way you get the weather angle of that like it's the way that woman brushed her arm there and he wasn't trying to save this is a good thing or a bad thing she was just saying notice as his daughter said he would always say go see do B get out into the world scene look around you do make something you know little late to have an exchange take it in to me along with Hampshire to sort of Secret Sauce of how they organized it would it I do not recognize the person who went into Hampshire in September of 1971 in the person who left in May or June of 75 I just completely rearrange my molecules and I have always had this extraordinary devotion and affection for it and when I lost Jerry when we watch scary his family obviously weather in collect to talk about him and what he and Elaine had had given us over those years and how transformative that exposure to their generosity weather was artistic really doesn't matter and I loved the fact that in retrospect those lines were blurred in my life where I just don't listen yeah I really look back also on my own history and the mentors who had the largest impact certainly had no clear boundary between two the war, work hours and off hours for me that is to say I I don't distinguish I mean I understand that the world sort of Sunday night gets a little bit unhappy and that I know Friday afternoon is come saying that supposed to be good I don't have that I don't have that is if you love your work you don't work a day in your life and start the find one at that but it's done it's the people I love are the people I work with her work with my daughter is one of my producers as my son-in-law all the time and people I mean my cinematographer 6 years and now we just want to go into situations and it's just heard it's almost like telepathy where we just a little gesture whatever and all of it if he if you were talking to Buddy Squires it was just extraordinary cinematographer what I've been parted About Cherry Leland how did you how did your father respond if it all to your decision to put all of your chips push all of your chips under the table for this one thing particularly given that you only had funds for 1 year I didn't conversation no I think a lot of it had to do with some stuff that we tell him he was not as mentally sound of me should be I came across a few years ago a letter from my mother to his mother her mother-in-law and what she saying I'm dying what am I going to do with my little boys he can't he can't possibly take care of them and we did okay and I think when I decided to text that I needed to get out of Dodge and I couldn't be at the scene of the crime that is the death the place where my mother had died and I think because he wasn't financially involved he had no resources he was in a kind of publish or perish situation with addition to help so it was really I was going to do this and I think he was happy for me that I had found the clutch necessary to put myself in here because he's still the most brilliant man I've ever met like a Maserati my younger brother did she wreck this guy demands without a clutch and you can rev the engine and that was my Dad what's the presenting symptom of the missing clutch depression or something that resembled depression in what if you don't mind me asking I believe I think we would all generally agree that it was probably bipolar but no significant attempt was made at a diagnosis was eventually at ended up at a certain level University and Western Michigan and somebody who was supposed to help him move didn't really and so we never really it was never really treated for that but it it was sad that he was an amateur still photographer and a professional Anthropologist and my very first memory the first little film strip that runs through my head is him seconds in building a dark room in the basement of our tract house in Newark Delaware where he was the only answer pologist in the state of Delaware and then the next clip is of me being held it is very strong left arm as he manipulated the tongue in that finish dark room one of the few things he finished in that every red light with a gas leak smells of the chemicals as I watch The Miracle of a picture come out of a blank page and if you think about what I do there is an anthropology to it and it is rooted in the DNA by DNA of my work is a still photograph even if I've got all the footage in the world I will still often default a real mean to communicating with a single still image and that's my dad as much as it is Jerome liebling and Elaine Mayes it's my dad with the kind of anthropology The Story of Us and so a lot of strengths and I hope goodness comes came from my mother who I had a very short time with on this Earth I mean we just passed this past April 6055 years without a mother which I have to tell you that is way too long but at the same time she is present every single day of my life in the way my father isn't any and I actually have to pay him the honor of having created not only me but my brother and my mother to and my brother Rick is much more understanding of this and we just had an interesting conversation together at the Telluride don't know what you're supposed to be talking about us and about him and stealing the physical love of my mother and always pushing away and going out doing things and having projects and so the thing that I'm lacking is that sense of Ultimate Security which he actually has if not the ability to execute in quite the same way that I am and so is just one of the most amazing conversations I've ever had in my life with the gift of my brother speaking truth to a situation that informs every film I made I mean Mike I was going through a crisis in my father-in-law my late father-in-law I said I seem to be keeping my mother alive cuz I couldn't be present on the day she died April 28th was always is always approaching and then always disappearing but I was never aware that day and he said I bet you blew out your candles as a young boy wishing she'd come back and said I did it my last birthday and he said you're kidding and I said what he said You Wake the Dead you make it over Ham Lincoln and Jackie Robinson come alive who do you think you are really trying to wake up and from that moment on iCloud George fighting away I've never not been present on April 28th for a long time it took me going to Ann Arbor with my vents smell children and renting a car and making a picnic out of it and visiting a grave that we had finally establish my father had not bothered to pick up the ashes and became one of those forgotten repressed memories of childhood and all the sudden at this crisis we buy brother and I realized you know what we have to to do this in so we track down her ashes at some godforsaken Cemetery way outside of Ann Arbor and put a plaque there and for many many years I would go there every year with or without my daughters and turn it into a an event and my mother's name is Lila l y l a nineteenth-century spelling street named after her mother who was born in had her first child she named her Lila l y l a i was born on January 18th 2011 and came to tell you that we never said Lila we still in this talk at Telluride Film Festival Mommy because her father went from Daddy to Dad or mother always with Mommy and I can't begin to tell you that there we never said that it was always draped in black crepe from April 28th 1965 until my granddaughter Lila was born in which case we say it 20 times a day and we talked to her and she's beautiful and she thinks you know the bird saying it's a wonderful wonderful thing toddler talking about before anxiety and and the burden of that it is said that is really beautiful thank you so much for sharing that and have being so forthcoming I think that not only is your personal experience informative I would imagine for a lot of people listening as you mentioned to me that the similarity of blowing out the candles and wishing your mother to be back I am sure that transcends the experiences of the two of you too many people who are listening who have lost a loved one above one type or another and I also think it's really important and courageous of you to talk very directly about your father's struggles with with mental illness with depression I have very severe bipolar depression on both sides of my family and that applies to blood relatives but also relatives by marriage and my aunt died of a Percocet plus out call overdose last year which is certainly Clear Lake or related to depression it's a this this this is really just a way of saying thank you for talking so vulnerably my life late father-in-law was an eminent psychologist and I felt when he had given me this gift of saying waking the dead at that's what I did for a living I realize that I was obligated in some ways to to be transparent in my in my individual biography and lies if I were going to continue doing what I was doing seemingly so successfully that is to say if I was going to feel the ability to talk about Abraham Lincoln I needed also or Jackie Robinson I needed the ability to talk about Lila and Robert and about my brother Rick and about my granddaughter Lila my daughter's Sarah Lilly Olivia and Willa and do so with you know no differentiation I'm sure they at times would like to have a friend separate life which they do have and because of the notoriety of the film sometimes there's two being talked to me about things that are emotional you know a veteran will say about the Vietnam film this is the best thing I've ever heard this helps me right here from another veteran that his best friend watched it and said something she's okay now I mean that's what happened but I realize that that the emotional archaeology that I had said at the very beginning of my first film I wish to pursue I was not interested in merely Excavating the dry dates and facts and events of the past but looking for an emotional archaeology that would soar go to the Richard those dry brittle shards together and I have to buy saying the word emotional for an astronaut that do not need Nostalgia or sentimentality that's the enemy of good anything but I do believe that there are higher emotions that we are fighting. Then so we would Retreat to a rational world most of the time square one and one always equals to one in fact what we want out of our love's out of our sex perhaps out of us face after a heart out of maybe just something simple like a cup of tea or are we looking at a sunset we want 1 and 1/2 equal 3 and I'm looking for that periodically that. Improbable equation to obtain in the films that we are working on what can I think that's as a narrative Alchemist of sorts that you you have managed with many of your films much of your work to create that that unlikely Synergy of one plus one equals three if you look at all of the ingredients all of the elements that you piece together over decades that the that the sum is greater I'm going to mess up this one I always mess this one up what is the whole is greater than the sum of its parts but you know it's him that's exactly it when we say that let's just stop for a second and take a rational approach let's say the sum of the parts comes up to here but the whole is up here what is in there what is in there that's the only question there is there's the phenomenal world that we can see in the end it we know is reflected light show the colors and sounds than all of these sorts of things Unseen World which is actually much more compelling if we knew how to trust and access it and that's the big human dilemma there's nobody gets out of this alive no one gets out of this alive and this is of an amazing clean depressing for the thing if you wish to take it that way and we could be reasonably excused as a sentient species for lying in a fetal position sucking our thumbs waiting for that we raise babies and we tend Gardens and we build buildings and we paint paintings in conversation with each other and we're keeping Wynton Marsalis cuz of the wolf from the door the wolf is the apprehension of our own mortality and that's what story telling you when you're required to edit Human Experience and how do you edit Human Experience is really what it's all about you know honey how your day getaways doesn't begin my back slowly down the driveway avoiding the garbage can at the curb unless of course somebody T-Bones you and that's exactly the way you described it but you say all you'll never believe what about storytelling beginning middle and end protagonist antagonist climax day tomorrow to take a human experience and by sharing a story like raising a baby like tending a garden like building building we insure a kind of immortality well said and the editing of The Human Experience is also one of those ever so valuable invisible Arts right alongside music and I want to remind people that your newest work is country music Explorer the history of uniquely American art form country music and I have a long description here that all include in the show notes and also have already been heard in the introduction I'm holding it in my hand right here a story of a miracle one song at a time I cannot wait to dig in and it premieres Sunday September 15th 8 7 Central you can also stream it and it's available on the PBS Video app so you can find that on PBS at work and also on the apps I'm very excited about this and I'm so thrilled that we were able to spend some time in conversation today is there anything else that you would like to say Ken before we before we wrap up I know I think that I would let Merle Haggard to we were very fortunate to be able to interview for this country music thing many many years ago 6 years ago and he passed away soon afterwards he said it's it's what we believe in but can't see like dreams and songs and soul and I love that idea that songwriting creating songs combining music like me these things that we believe in but can't see I quoted you a couple lines from Hank Williams Johnny Cash at my door the leaves are falling a cold wild men will come sweethearts walk by together and I still miss someone I don't know that's all I'm saying and it is a, if I sang it would be a combination of music and words and it's stuff that we believe in like dreams and songs and solos Merle Haggard one of the greatest of all Emmylou Harris nursing home later on 5 episodes later this is an introduction that he says that the five episodes later she said he want to know what kind of music is Merle Haggard record any Merle Haggard albums and put the needle just stating her put the needle on any cut it doesn't matter which one is if you take it from this I always think whenever your peers on are some he's like and I just think of you take it from this God from that it's the things that we believe in but can't see like dreams and songs and stole you feel like you're dealing with that. world that I was speaking about that they were apprehending or trying to apprehend something that is just beyond our Ken nopales and is there for us if we expose ourselves to it and I think that's the business of art is the transfer of emotion from one person to another sounds pretty straightforward and simple and I will leave you with two great philosophers and it seems easy but sometimes it's complicated and it's worth the couple it's worth the complication can't thank you so much for taking this time I had I had just a wonderful experience bouncing around here in the Aether having this conversation and I highly
