me gets lost on that stage Barack Obama and the deportation policies when they were in office when the battle was vice President Obama was President and all the negative backlash they got here is what he said about you I'm the vice president knighted states all right what people don't like about Joe Biden is that he will invoke Barack Obama's name whenever it's to his benefit but whenever there's a policies that are question then it's all of a sudden it wasn't my decision and one person that pointed that out was doing Castro more problem with Vice President Biden and Corey pointed this out last time is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up he says oh I was there I was there I was there that's me to and then every time somebody questions or the administration that we were both part of he says well that was the president I mean he wants to take credit for Obama's work but not have to answer any questions you have what I did not say I don't stay out I stand with Barack Obama all eight years good bad and indifferent it's a damn shame that you'll buy to the front runner cuz you could not look up on that stage and say to yourself he is like The Runaway top 10 candidate that

Budden I was just crazy like a lot of people didn't even when I took the job to be vice president of US like I never did like a press release and never did nothing like that cuz I knew this is going to hate you know I'm saying I think it's it's better to stay low and keep firing going to have years ago with you and you the VP of Atlantic driving range after The Breakfast Club interview after The Breakfast Club interview vice-president my last interview here I took the job after that and then we talked and I think at that point like I had a couple number ones I did Big Sean bounce-back idea Chris Brown party and then going to Atlantic man in the last two-and-a-half years as a writer producer I sold 15 million records with him and i v p a n I gave a boogies first number one record getting Meek Mill first number one record so if I don't like that's my brother he changed my life like for real for real with nobody was rocking with me he took me on tour and everybody know Jeremiah bounce to the beat of his own drum like so exactly so I was able to have like 50 Jeremiah records nobody has Jeremiah Hooks and all that other stuff and I was able to run it up in that really put me in a position to really like change my life for real for real officially Partners or a brother and we just work like we're cereal collaborators like and you know we just work all the time that's what's funny the funny thing is that the girl from Love & Hip Hop Hazel E introduce me to your mom and we went to the studio to do what what Jeremiah came into a record for her and then it turned into just me and him working and me giving a song to Meek and meek and Chris Brown first collaboration I mean I'm glad I made it out who is in me and cardi B that I wouldn't say K Michelle butt she right back in it anyway so how is your button right back and I feel bad was here like I could just imagine what you all was going to go through this season with him you know I'm saying his baby mother and not being together like they don't think I'm spice that up for sure man told me he got a new dollars to do it I still don't believe no way he's a liar God damn it. All in this business and I can't fact check JoJo around looking for cars Love & Hip Hop please get a salamander cage one wouldn't approve that back I want to put nobody a million, million a double that maybe they gave him five and gave Sam 5 and that's how you make when you think that's who you think is the most paid person on Love & Hip Hop Remy Ma and Papoose right now I depend on y'all really watch the show right now I don't know the way back to the first Dallas shut up directions very well at all because like they put me in a mix all that Love & Hip Hop you don't want to sound like I was trying to separate myself from that because I went through traumatic the only show like they tried to like kill my whole career again in like they put me around a bunch of bull and I was like else to keep that away from me any when trademark like I would always say like tough like that's my an even trade mark my behind my bag in trademark could be used for multiple different things you know I'm saying read up in the studio that was capped know that would Love & Hip Hop cap but an ad today host of sublimate wow so that's what that's where we stood we parted ways because I might go if y'all can use me for that type of bait just for whatever y'all doing there ain't no telling what y'all can do with me and like I'm vice president of Atlantic Records I can't be having like that go on you know I'm saying that's that was really my place of business and Atlantic put me in the studio to be at so why I had to cut that off for real he was just on Instagram live in and out the room and be doing a lot of different stuff I didn't know nothing like a real situation over Love & Hip Hop / rap again you don't wanna be all the time so really not see the thing is that a lot of people like yeah I'm a writer yeah my producer but I'm about to be the biggest executive in the game like Craig, don't have to get up got that seat for me you know I'm saying one of these days like I'm about to be bigger than every executive out here because I actually have the relationships and I actually make these records like when I created dangerous for Meek like that was just something he's just being in the studio we get that song at 30 minutes and then it turned into being a big record for them and I think that a lot of an arse no disrespect to them a lot of my glorified middlemont you know I'm saying it just like I know this person are they taking credit for records because they put somebody in the studio with somebody when I'm actually on the ground level get my hands dirty with it as well as bigger like I'll look them in a face and be like yo I'm going to be bigger than you did nothing wrong with that but I will say this is very hard for Creative to be in those seats that's why I gotta lie Craig to be in St like they don't put. how much is a co-producer I like it like that cardi B record with J Balvin and although he actually didn't all carbon all the walls okele read either executive to he wasn't music Creator he was a created any more so like the Blessed thing about what I do is that like I said like I really able to get never work with nobody like like that like closely because he just goes in the studio and just kill these records and goes crazy in a plaque up and they go stupid I was the first one for them to like really open up for we went to Hawaii he gave me his whole album look back at it with the song that was like we had that song for 9 months so me being vice president break as I was able to hit a wreck if he's waiting on a sample to be clear the song was actually 5 minutes and some change long I took the record and who I added the snaps to it and I restructure the record I made it a 3-minute record in the first number one executive you haven't Talent Chisholm that go on with it you know like when one person get up they get a little homie that the job you don't send which is nothing wrong with that as long as you qualify for the gig you know come back don't move into Breakfast Club good morning dnv Angela Yee Charlamagne the guy we are The Breakfast Club on kicking it with Yung Berg and get it hitmaker it's my symbol serious all the time to work with on top box a boogie 2 Chainz Meek Mill ybn nahmir and tiger all on the record so it's all the pretty easy for you to get anybody to be on your album because you work with a lot of these are just like exchanges that's what I deal with a lot of people will I don't got so much money and I don't got so late that I'm not really charging people you know I'm saying like if I got a relationship with you I can sue Chainz I've known him since he was Teddy Boy Hits record with Ariana Grande rule the world his last year I did that I didn't charge them. You know I'm saying that's how I was able for him to get on my record and everybody that's pretty much on it I want to listen to be somebody from royalty in Pacifica right now just that some of the people that don't know what they thought about shot everybody at Def Jam maybe they was going through you know they just transitional about hiring and firing people a lot so I mean maybe that was tripping and lost in the sauce on that one what did he make alarm from Yung Berg keep the right people around you never do too much you know I was riding back and pay my God why I was drinking a lot like what was ecstasy a lot back in the day and you know like it was good for me because I made all them here records on it and it was bad for me because you know you get out of character and when you young and you just get millions of dollars out of nowhere like and you don't have no oh jeez you don't have nobody telling you what to do what not to do how to move know how not to move you end up in some Yung Berg and hopefully you work hard enough to become hitmaker things that happened in my life is a real movie like for real for real Nicki Minaj what do you think about how it is with Nikki I think that people feel like she's going through something right now but everybody sitting in his room no that's just Nicki Minaj I like you. Anytime she don't curse me out and I said some of the craziest went on the week was going to beat me up at one point when they was dating and all that up for ya like she and nausea, I was only making hate train but my thing is like your heart you work for Atlantic you know Atlanta, plot no absolutely not absolutely not and it at the end of the day I can not say nothing bad about Nicki cuz yeah she cursed me out and we did a lot of things like when I was when I was working with her she really put her arm around me and really embraced me and like I got a lot of clout like a lot of cool points cuz I'm in Nicki Minaj do your everyday I love doing six records on her album and it was great time for me mine is but now that I got money and I'm rich like I can't beat I won't be tolerated like talkin to me like that I can't do it that she accuse you of being on the Atlantic now I'm not at all sure I guess he was actually proud of me when I first got my gig like I told her she flew me down in Miami because like for a while like her and meet with dealing with each other and imma keep it a hundred like meat folding me off the island at that time at that time it was his girl I was in the studio all the time with her and I just think that it was like oh he got to move around so they can remove me I moved around and then when they broke up she hit me back and I need up working a little bit I did remove you I'm confused why did he remove you from the studio just crazy times and it was just real crazy times like the truth of the matter is that I didn't know him and Nikki were dating know so I was seeing me out and I'm like hell I'm going to go do this going to go do this with with some holes or whatever I didn't know they was dating I'm in the studio just talkin it like you know I'm saying I seen me earlier you know this that and the third of all about we just kicking it she went snitched on me like it like that I didn't know that they were dating at all and that's how we got him if that's how it happened cuz you receive these girls know now you're wrong because my guy so don't even do that meat was just at my birthday dinner that's my dog so don't even throw in a message let me go to the Capitol years because my husband was there and he might have been doing nothing. You don't just stand there for me too cuz Safari was actually around at the same time to 2 like I will be in the studio with Nicki and Safaree would be in the studio and then what she was I don't know yeah it was a weird time to make the decision to fully commit to the hitmaker thing I just realized that you're like I got good product but people getting wanted from me they didn't want me to give you the one that was delivering a message with delivering the song So my first big ones will John by Rick Ross and Lil Wayne I was Grammy nominated for that shut off of a on kids in my next big one was Tamar Braxton the one and that's what I'm prompting me to fly back and move back to LA shut off the Vincent Herbert and Tamar Braxton you know that was able to do it for you no boy sound like in tomorrow is that this funny as hell yo it's funny as hell would say Mark has after I gave it a hit like she went on a rant that I didn't do this and I didn't do that or whatever and then like I was at the BMI Awards and I seen her and I touched her and she was like he touched me and I just touched her on the shoulder you got was like damn I just gave you a hit and then from there she was like hi bird isn't it I don't want to look at a man with a mouth open that you've worked on the song rest in peace LaShawn Daniels we just passed she knows for sure knew that what I did and what my collaboration to the song was they took my tag off the song they went crazy on me in the end I don't know I didn't want to give you the credit you know I wasn't I wasn't big enough at that point I guess and then she all of my pictures on my lights my comment so I guess you want another is it bad for you to like stay behind the scenes and just write and produce or why would I want to work as hard as he got to work like I'm I'm I'm in the studio you think I want to run around like for my fan going for my stuff I'm doing this strictly because they know they said youngberg was finished he'll never have another hit record again I went and I had hit records now I'm about to have a hit record with my own same exact Union Berg no more I mean if I have until I get a face off or something like that I'm still going to be letting you know I'm saying are we got more with young Byrd AKA hitmaka when we come back let's get into his new joints called that box The Breakfast Club come on that was stop box morning everybody is DJ Envy Angela Yee Charlamagne the guy we are The Breakfast Club hitmaker Yung Berg is here.

I was a hit make a bird we appreciate y'all having all right at The Breakfast Club Stephen A Smith and Markieff Morris started going back and forth on Twitter and it's over that but slap from back in 2017 Stephen A Smith was on The Breakfast Club and this is what happened that was by Maurice for the Washington Wizards until couple of days later he said publicly will I just did that cuz that's all I could do not like we'll wait a minute why don't you just playing around that's what you were doing somebody smacked me in my but I don't know how to take that he's actually had that happen to me I didn't know I was dipping he's at it is after game right yeah I know but he didn't think it was a big deal at that time you know until he heard differently otherwise so I keep more went on Twitter and says Stephen A Smith stop being a tough guy behind cameras and Mikes have that same energy next time I see you like you had on The Breakfast Club Stephen A Smith respond it ain't about being done tough guy broke I simply pointed at had thought you were playing around a couple of years ago and then you publicly stated with your real intent was afterward to someone in the media so I said had I known it wouldn't have gone down like that. Smack me on my ass okay so yeah so there was some back and forth about that afterward. I guess anything physical you know is that I can sell to these guys are old they will be out there fighting they look so stupid out there fighting on the card that's good news the reason why he's at his dad's cell can use cuz he got his new teeth he got his veneers in so he said he's determined today is the day I stop smoking cigarettes and he said plus I got new teeth after the fact that I can give you cancer and kill you but damn you don't mess up the new teeth call little baby he definitely whatever it takes a little baby I always said he's quitting acting after Empire he said he's done he won't be pursuing any more on camera rolls and that's that he said I'm done pretending I don't know what's going on at sounds like he's having a lot of issues in his personal life I would hate to see him not act anymore though he's in some great movies he's he's he's light skinned he's like me he's emotionally overreacted I'm sure he'll be back and say you know what it was a bad decision a bad thought it just right now he's like you said don't do it right all right now let's discuss Chance the rapper net he did an interview he was on big boy and he talked about a lot of different things including cardi B and Nicki Minaj is beef here's what he had to say is produced like all the information the way that they phrase it to us the way that you know that they pit people against and I think I don't want to speak for them at all but I feel like to a certain extent they got pushed into that too and I don't think that all of that was 100% their feelings I mean I don't know if it's manufactured I mean I think those two ladies had a disagreement somehow someway something didn't connect and they just really don't like each other but I think the labels probably feel like they benefit off of it and then on that level though you know what I'm saying like when I don't like you I just ignore you and you don't exist right me to all right now also he talked he talks about being inspired to get married after a conversation that he had with offset it was like everybody doesn't know this but like this thing between me and body isn't fake we actually just got married in my backyard like a couple weeks ago and we didn't tell anybody and this was before I got announced and this is before like everything that's happened to their relationship and he was like this is my wife this is like one be with the rest of my life so like just keep it real with me if you got to do this and I was like before you said I wanted to do it but now I'm going to do a damn I'm going to propose to my wife saying what it is I mean you want to get married in the end of comfortability of your own house and your family around I'm not mad at that and that's inspiring with somebody else you know and respect in the business and has done something that influenced him so there you have it all right well I'm Angela Yee and that is you are truly report when we come back tell me to give us

power sometimes think they're above the law was Sergeant David Payne you abused her power people not only did she abused her power and hypocrisy is real because anybody did something that she usually like somebody else for somebody else up for let's go to News 12 Westchester weather report please out her wallet to pay Ava Pina stuffed about $350 worth of items into her purse I haven't had a Macy's in Yonkers Authority say she didn't get far though as she tried to leave the store she was arrested painting now facing a petty larceny charge with suspended without pay from her job as an NYPD Sergeant now this is actually an indictment against the NYPD because a lot of money if she was you would not the shoplifting at the travesty because public servants like teachers cops firefighters they should be making top dollar and they don't and that's a damn shame because he leaves them to committing crimes like this but I don't have any empathy for her the same way they don't have empathy

that money and earn your $350 a good old-fashioned Cowboy have you never seen training day now I don't know how long she's been on the force but the starting salary for NYPD officers 2500 after 5 and

something that's so now maybe you need to give yourself Donkey of the Day a magazine Gladwell will be here okay if you've ever read the outline if you ever read blank if you ever read Tipping Point if you ever read David and Goliath he's got a new book out called talking to strangers and I promise you this book is so doesn't sorry for the time that we live in because none of us know how to communicate with each other what we talkin to Mac Malcolm Gladwell we come back into Breakfast Club Breakfast Club morning everybody is DJ Envy Angela Yee Charlamagne Tha God We Are The Breakfast Club we got a special guest in the building he was born on September 3rd as well is there a connection that is crazy I'm bored of September 30th of September 3rd wax Charlemagne Napoleon was born in September 3rd wow and some books are good read some books and necessary manuals for the times that we live in and that's exactly what I think talking to strangers this man a manual for the times that we live in what we should know about the people we don't know I think is your best work but what is it look about it starts with the story of Sandra Bland which is what inspired the book and it ends with the story of Sandra Bland in the middle is an attempt to figure out what happen because for some reason I don't really have a good explanation why of all of those cases in that I guess it was like all those cases were in the news that was the one that got me use Amanda Knox you use Brock Turner. One out of my head because it was so maybe it's the middle of the day in me know in a college town in Texas the young professional woman driving down the street pulled over for no reason and then it just completely unraveled and and the weird thing is that we have the whole thing as videotape so there's no dispute about those cases is a dispute the officer says well you know and so I decided and I got upset with that tape and I decided it's so weird to think that this completely trivial encounter could spiral out of control and then didn't answer vending Dead 3 days later that I decided it was also realize that that encounter with some out typical don't know if a lot of the big high-profile cases that we were obsessed with her all about the same thing which is about strangers meeting each other and something going wrong misunderstanding each other that's how to talk to strangers like responding. A little bit will if you saw a lot of the wooden folks on the book is what are the ways in which we get other people wrong what are the things that lead us astray when were meeting someone for the first time I did not encounter with the listen to becomes clear to clear if you listen the caucus is deposition in June investigation and he is totally weird position comes through these terrified of her because she becomes convinced that she's dangerous and I completely misread what she is upset but you completely Miss Reed's someone's discomfort and anxiety and anger at being pulled over as threatening behaviour think nobody's ever really that pleasant when they get pulled over especially for something that lane change or whatever it was so she got pulled over because he didn't like the fact that she lit the cigarette right and he didn't like the fact that she wouldn't get out of the car because it felt like his ego wanted him to wanted her to just bow down to whatever it was it he was telling her to do and she was challenging it clear he very quickly gets in over his head but he gets in over his head I think because he makes a series of very rapid assumptions about her that are completely false and that's why that is that part of it and also secondarily that he's been put in a position like you go to that cops history you realize he was stopping everyone for everything so this is not some random encounter for him as part of a practice not just of him but a police officer in general they are in is a philosophy of policing that requires him to go out and stop anyone looks even remotely suspicious on the off chance they might be doing something wrong if you do that you're going to get into trouble right you going to force you to put these boxes in situations where there are required to make very rapid assessments of people that are going to be around anus and is that kind of group of factors that in the interest me and I think that shows up like I was saying the book talks about Brock Turner in Sandusky Amanda Knox and Bernie Madoff versions of the same thing which is people meet a stranger and they totally got them wrong what is its fasting on so many levels because it's like super super super smart people are people who consider themselves really really smart what completely taken in by a kind of hilarious like is a certain superiority of among people of Wall Street that you think they're above all this kind of stuff in tooth is their friends fallacy would that be considered chapter 6 chapter 6 which is I start with an episode of Friends and point out that you can follow an episode of Friends with the sound off because every single emotion that any kind of your friends has is displayed purple going to face right and I had an extra a psychologist is an expert in facial expressions go through the episode and you know if Joey is Angry Joe is Facebook's if Monica is like surprise her jaw drops in her eyes go wide and we if you watch things like that you get the impression that that's the way the real world works that you can rely how to predict how someone's feeling from their expressions a true fact that's not the way the Brooks at all and this is a source of big trouble particular for police officers who have a whole series of things in there had about what what what suspicions looks like a wet nervousness looks like if you break your eyes incredible percentage of cops think that if the person you're talking to avert their eyes it means that they are hiding something on your guilty that is not what it means on friends that's what it means right but it lies all kinds of cops is a psychologist produces hilarious that he would he looks at like four years of Cops episodes and cousin cops you always know whether the person who is being interviewed is guilty find out whether they're guilty or innocent right so he looks at it compares the facial expressions of the guilty and the innocent people on Cops it's real world from cameras running is not in some lab it's like find this is incredible differences in the way that guilty white people black people and Hispanic behave and also that innocent white people black people in Spanish it's just different cultural ways of of managing a situation where you're talking to a police officer if you're out in the real world where people are different than a cop pulls up next to me or behind me I get into me a little nervous even though I'm not breaking any law I'm not doing anything wrong I'm not on my phone by seatbelts on my paperwork is right and I'm like oh my God they're about to pull me over. I don't get nervous at all I'll get more aggressive because I know I did nothing wrong. I'd like you can judge somebody off their demeanor and a lot of times when you grow up in a certain environment that is actually a survival tactic is a lot of times you are correct about people that you even speak about in the book house cops can tell when somebody has a gun on them while they think they can I don't know whether they're there was one cop who's really good at this back in the day but he couldn't teach anyone how to do what he did so I mean I think there are very limited rare examples of people that are good at that fit a lot of people in these professions are just way over confident in their ability to read people and that's a fact I think if we're going to go if we're going to prevent these kind of cases in the future morning everybody is DJ Envy Angela gay Charlamagne the guy we are The Breakfast Club was still kicking it with Malcolm Gladwell Charlemagne what's up what's up with the Kansas City experiment you talk about the police officers carry there's not an individual problem with the system on for a while and I saw that the sex with Donald Sterling is forced out has the owner of the Clippers because he makes those comments to his girlfriend by Ramona Shelburne has this amazing podcast about the case I listen to it twice they were actions brought by a sin by the Department of Justice and by the under because he was discriminating against black people in his housing developments brightness fine with it life goes on and then he makes these comments was confident in the world blows up Matt Barnes he says wait a minute like we knew about this guy for 25 years and now you're getting upset and it's the it's just weird things to study was a personal if someone personally is racist we go crazy but if they are systematically doing something we're my fine with it but mean is it a hundred times worse if you don't let black people rent apartments in your building right if you say something racist to your girlfriend just as like a hundred times worse than there was voter suppression in Georgia than the governor of Virginia wore blackface like price of a middle-class a middle-aged white guy from Virginia who was a frat boy in college at some point in his life was in blackface and 7 but the fact that Stacey Abrams probably lost because of some really nasty that's something that like Fades away after this is weird thing where this stuff that's about systems just goes over our heads and personal stuff gets this crazy every day with Donald Trump Mueller she would Sandra bland is it is an issue that this guy is a racist the larger question is that there is a philosophy of policing that says it is legitimate for police officers to go everywhere even neighborhoods where there is no crime and stop people just because they believe in the back of their head there is a tiny chance they may be doing something that is a something individual cups do on their own it is something they are taught to do and that part that's the that's the outraged right who cares whether when the sky goes home at night it's a Confederate flag as well as a system that is that is in place and I what I want to do with this book is kind of get our Focus back on the systematic things that I agree with you when you take somebody who will you when you have a system like that but then you take somebody who may be a racist or maybe a big it doesn't it make them easier for them to you know exert that racism because but I don't know I was run up against this thing with vases and was wishes so some percentage significant percentage of people I don't know what it is that when does but are probably on some level racist I don't know what you do about that might like you I don't know how you get rid of I don't know how you changed my mind all you can do is you can change the system in which they're operating will you can so that their racism doesn't harm people as much experience with Bernie Madoff and how you had to sit down with him and let you know that was made up with the guy who caught topless who is you know I think it can be said a very weird dude who's the guy who 10 years before anyone else figured out that Madoff was the problem with this guy is super smart but he's completely paranoid and the reason he doubts Madoff is he does to everyone but you don't have my point in that chapter is you actually don't want to be that guy you don't want to live your life thinking everyone is potentially dangerous or batter it's like I think this guy he has the most deeply unhappy but I don't trust him and everybody that cuz that's what most people that's the most people get scammed that's all I got to go get taken advantage of and like I like to think that you trust people until they give you a reason not to some people look at it I don't trust anybody until they until I know them better and I bet them out and it takes a long time to earn your trust but I feel like okay what you show me is what I'll take it at face value until you prove to me otherwise I think I tend to err I mean you're right you don't want to be completely gullible you would do some Middle Ground here but I really think that happiness lies on the I would rather be occasionally scammed and okido trusting then be on the other side of the equation and be said of paranoid the other people so let's say you were journalist basic Special A Time your profile and you have a choice to either interview the subject of the profile for as long as you want or you can never meet that person we should get unlimited access to everyone in their life all their friends co-workers picture of this person would you choose I would say everybody else in their life I think that's a better shot at who they are an hour to get to know a stranger quickly give me someone for half an hour in a job interview that they are putting on their best face not being themselves but if you had unlimited access to have with all their former co-workers old employers family they're going to give you a far more nuanced picture is my last question in chapter 12 title Sandra Bland you said we are in that when it comes to talking to strangers and we think we can transform the stranger without cost to sacrifice into the familia in the known and we can't then you ask the question what should we do so what should we do when it comes to talk to the strange is Malcolm Gladwell we should be there is no Especial this is not a book that ends with this kind of perfect it doesn't read dark place but I think we have to be a lot more cautious in the judgments we make about others and we need to be a lot more humble in our in our understanding of how good we are at meeting people so don't jump to the conclusion you know if you're up please have seen you walking up to Sandra Bland's window and you think your your face with a baby you can't make sense of don't jump to conclusion that she's dangerous enough to get you but slow down ask a questions be a nice person me to snow this is simply that the lesson of all this is that who just I don't know why were in such a hurry to to pigeonhole people and describe them and I'm tryna Jennifer by their patterns and behaviors get these Instagram, before everybody else that's why I got to jump to conclusions like to go direct to report and book this year and this is a must-read so I think everybody should read it thank you so much I think it's my angriest I think it that I got concerned when I get angry but that's what I'm a very much have a very mild Canadian that's what it looks like a mild Canadian. The same way on him as someone else The Breakfast Club Angela says that he thinks 10 to 20% of pro athletes are gay and the NBA is ready for an athlete to come out so he said he doesn't get people to be shocked by not becoming at will be supportive saying as long as he plays and performs does it even matter about your life nobody cares about your lifestyle like yeah people that still getting beat up on the street randomly kill Gaius verres just post something to say that you come and see all the people that comment under your picture and saying nasty mean think so yes people do care but different ballgame could these guys are millionaires these guys can ball you can actually play ball in eye care if you gay in the NBA I think that's the truth Jason Collins nobody knew his name until he came out what are your phone of Brooklyn Nets nobody knows about it was a love all right now cardi B she is leading the 2019 BET Hip Hop Awards he has 10 nominations so congratulations to her that's a huge deal for cardi B Drake has seven nominations and and cardi B by the way she want for last year at the BET Hip Hop Awards so congratulations to her and pretty sure she's going to win a lot this year as well.
