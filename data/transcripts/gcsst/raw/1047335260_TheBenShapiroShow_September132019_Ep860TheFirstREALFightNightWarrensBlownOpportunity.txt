fight night Joe Biden mumbles Bernie bumbles Warren fumbles and everyone grumbles I'm Ben Shapiro this is Ben Shapiro show now that's some pretty outside enthusiasm for what end up being pretty soporific today top rhythmic in the dictionary last night for the Democrats who was the first real dad makes you got all ten of the leading candidate meaning three leading candidates in a bunch of lilliputian you got all of them on one state it was who's going to be the moment when we got some clarity on the Kansas we didn't instead what we ended up with was a bunch of people loving each other with sticks and it wasn't really particularly telling because how you think it went last night depends on what your expectations were going in so if you thought that Joe Biden was going to collapse and fall off the stage didn't quite do that and you sort of stumbled around onstage not going to some furniture but he's so upright and he's he's a ride if you got the Bernie Sanders is going to collapse into putting that didn't happen either Bernie was Bernie by Bernie is always burning that has been burning since he was five and he sort of like the high school principal in Jackson like I was always bald Alberni was always burning and bring will remain Bernie long after he's dead Bernie will be stumbling around talking about making the rich pay their fair share and if you thought that Elizabeth Warren was going to have a breakout moment in this is where I think it didn't change anything but it did change an underlying assumption if you thought that this was Elizabeth Warren's moment she really didn't she really didn't see what we have right now just in terms of the Dynamics of the democratic race is a three-way standoff we have a very end of The Good the Bad and the Ugly and three people and the other guns pointed at each other and it is utterly unclear who's going to fire first and each person has a sort of prisoner's dilemma with the other members of the stage at the worst possible option is for them to open up their guns on the other members of the stage but if nobody opens up their guns and everything remains exactly as it is with biting eating out a narrow victory over the combined voting for of Sanders and Warren but for each individual candidate they have no real interest in starting a firefight Joe Biden a little bit with Warren a little bit and Warren didn't really hold up particularly well to it but the fact is that each one of those candidates or wants to avoid conflict with the other two so if you're burning what you're hoping is it buying a tax warrant warrant acts fine. They knock each other out like a NASCAR crash and you just run on the inside Lane and win the nomination if you're buying you're hoping that eventually Sanders and Warren Tire of being best friends and I go after each other and you just sort of walked through that Meadow Lanes Menomonee Shannon and if you're Warren you hope that Bernie at a certain point gets frustrated and takes out by for your benefit but in doing so Poison the Well with all the buy-in voters and all of them end up with Elizabeth Warren do you have all of these three candidates the guns pointed at each other but none of them actually have an interest in starting a firefight there's a lot of talk before the debate yesterday about maybe this was going to be the moment when they open up their guns on one another but that's not happening that's not happening in the person who really in the end does need to break away from the pack has worn so it if you if your assumption for Baseline assumption is that if Warren just keeps doing what she's doing then she had to find last night if your Baseline assumption is she does need to do something to overcome Biden and that is my assumption because the polling numbers at this point as much as there's been talk about her early polling numbers in her gradual rise in all this has no support in the black community support level remains absolutely study in Iowa right now Bernie and Biden are running ahead of Elizabeth Warren and a New Hampshire in several of the polls Bernie is running ahead of Elizabeth Warren if he loses Iowa and New Hampshire she is toast or she has to win at least one of those two races which means I think she has to make a move you add that to the fact that she is obviously the smartest person on the stage and turns like you taught at Harvard Law School she has written some pretty well cited articles on bankruptcy and I've seen her teach classes right she's fully capable of Engagement Socratic method of engaging in back and forth I really expected more from her in the bay to my expectations were disappointed you got pretty much what you expected with all the other candidate you got to buy who was combative and old and have senile but the truth is it that bite is actually pretty damaging in a general election campaign why because all of his foibles all the stuff that makes buying a bit of a week primary candidate makes him a dangerous general election candidate including the fact that he's old and kind of senile why because in a general election the fact is that if you are looking for default candidate who doesn't scare you Joe Biden looks a lot like I can get it I mean the guy has to have people choose mashed potatoes warm when it's not scary but there's a clip around last night I've dated mirror ask when buying a question and it's obvious that is Polident came loose and those denture start shifting around and now he's trying to buy him back into his mouth looking like Jim Carrey from the man is a real bad moment visually providing play a little bit of that if you couldn't get it done after Sandy Hook why should voters give you another chance before the NRA only one ever be dinner and he finally out there but it's pretty obvious that means he's a general election is premise here is an old man who doesn't threaten you in any way that's because he's running against Trump and Trump has high toxicity level so if you are trying to run dead tree stump against Trump if you're casting that in Central Casting Joe Biden is that even his gas in a general election play okay so what was anybody's impression of Joe Biden change dramatically last night I don't think so was anybody's impression of Bernie Sanders change last night of course not because Bernie Sanders is most consistent candidate in the field he was is and always will be Bernie Sanders in old red from the 1930s Elizabeth Warren she didn't change perceptions but she didn't lower sort of the estimation of her skill level because she's supposed to be the one with the plan right she's supposed to be the one who is capable of navigating the twists and turns of turning people inside out she's going to prosecute the case against Trump if she's so smart and she basically fumble got there last night I thought I thought you did not have good answers to any of the questions that were asked to her I thought that she feels like someone who is not comfortable with her own agenda that's really what she feels like she feels like somebody feels like she has to say all these things but doesn't actually believe them Bernie is the True Believer Sanders is the new convert who sort of not into the whole speaking in tongues thing right she she she walks into the church and she's like well iced I get that I sort of have to be a commie but at the same time I'm not really a commie and turn really uncomfortable with saying all of these communist nostrum at Bernie's out there going I will spend all the money just go bankrupt the country no I do it well you know your plans as soon as Bernie and Bernice honest and you're not I just got a lot of the Bernie Bros look at Elizabeth Warren and I like she is a dishonest Paul and that is correct she is a little jump into the actual content of the debate in just one second don't worry they're going to be the bait grades when you go through each of the candidates supposed to say Andrew Yang is the only one who doesn't receive a grade is Andrew Yang are you just did and there's no Gray he's not on the chart but everyone else has to have a lot coming up first on the road maybe

little while suffice it to say this was basically a giant holding pattern I don't think you're going to see the pole shift in any Direction One Way or Another I think the media are going to continue to try to uphold Elizabeth Warren as the front-runner of the campaign despite the fact that in the Real Clear Politics poll average she's dead even with Bernie Sanders right now the number to stand behind Joe Biden what Dad said I thought you underperform last night I thought you had a real opportunity to break out and I think she absolutely not the big winner of the debate as per our usual Arrangement is Donald Trump why because you had a bunch of Democrats were shouting at each other about all the things they were going to take away from you in your private health insurance they're going to take away from your car they're going to take away from you you're done they're going to take away from you your sense of the goodness of the country they're going to release criminals onto the street they're going to take away from the border control in and take all these things away from you these Democrats and in return they will give you an enormous levels of Taxation and that was basically the policy picture last night about winning the primary but there is something that I think has shifted in American politics since the Richard Nixon day so the old man OST from the Richard Nixon you said throw out there about presidential politics is that music Republican you run to the right in the primary into the center in general and you seen everybody in politics abide by this nostrum that that I know if you run to be left in the primary and runs the center in the general there's only one problem now this thing called tape and things that you say in the primaries don't stay in the primaries the stuff that you say in primary debates end up resurfacing in the general election and if that's the case good night for Trump because the fact is that every Democrat on stage basically pledge to be incredibly radical except for Joe Biden which is why I say the biggest threat to Donald Trump in this election is and remains Joe Biden why because he's unthreatening he's a grandpa that you drop off a Denny's at 6 to pick him up at 6:30 to bring him home women PJs you put him in bed watching a couple episodes of Matlock that's not threatening it doesn't feel like oh God he's going to ship the country out from underneath me and that's really buy into a campaign is that he's non-threatening and somebody was Barack Obama That's the other dividing one that none of the other Democrats can get around no one has staple themselves Obama's pants leg with more Staples than Joe Biden I mean that you took a staple gun and just staple them self directly to Barack Obama's pant leg and last night he made that obviously made that clear and the other Democrats suddenly realizing that wait a second Barack Obama was pretty popular among Democrats and particularly among black voters they started to pay at least mild homage to Barack Obama for the problem is they can't draw contrasted by without drawing contrast with Obama so again I don't think the bad news out of this right people are already counting by now I think that he's a week and I think he's been receiving but I do not think that he is out and I was a little bit encouraged by his performance if if I'm in his campaign and a little bit more than crave by Elizabeth Warren Performance Machine just did nothing last night she was just a wet sack last night and she just did not do any okay so what's jump into house they want from the very beginning so we begin with the opening statement and their the usual Litany of complaints against Trump Kamala Harris who has decided that her entire campaign is going to be Trump is horrible and mean and very very bad to every answer she gave last night was how mean and terrible and horribly bad. Trump is think of a single reason anyone should vote for her because there is no reason to Bumper, her she's awful there is Kamala Harris making her picture Trump is a mean mean man whose mean it doesn't mean things they only reason you've not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime but here's what you don't get what you don't get is that the American people are so much better than this and there's nothing more still didn't American politics and when a candidate says into camera directly to mr. president I know you're listening to this right now you're a mean bad man look how Brave I am going right in Baltimore but this is because Donald Trump is Bernie Sanders actually like I think people were treating Elizabeth Warren as though she's a serious upgrade from Sanders I don't think that's right I don't think that's right Bernie is more passionate or any is crazier bring is more consistent Elizabeth Warren is occupied in this weird middle space between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden she wants to grab Sanders's policy adherence will also appearing to be somewhat more moderate like Biden it's an uncomfortable place to be sort of between a rock and a hard place that I don't think that the support base for either one of those candidate is in serious danger of a rotating to the point of Disappearing who is Bernie Sanders explaining in his typical shouting at the sky Homer Simpson's father's passion about how we need to stop the Old Rocky Top of government we need to stop them because they have provided me with these glasses and all my clothing but that bad we have talked to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control economic and political life of this country and as president I am prepared to take that Bond wow and he gave you the crazy eyes he gave you the he swallowed an entire shovel full of gravel before he even started this Kentucky swallowed fellow candidate make gravel right before this debate began does his picture and then there was more inspection Warren's pictures I'm so brilliant I have a plan I have a plan for everything except that when you were asked like simple basic questions about your plan it didn't go great for you here is one of our last night the past two Americas Bill class have gotten a lot smaller and a lot narrower today service members are preyed upon by predatory lenders students are crushed by debt and families cannot afford childcare I know what's broken I know how to fix it and I'm going to leave the fight to get it done okay she is people keep saying she's charismatic I see no evidence of Charisma right there I mean really like we have prepared I'll tell you what we prepared on the show we have prepared for the possibility of Elizabeth Warren Woods score some can somebody and then we're going to play the GIF of her dancing like a crazy person and rally and you know it didn't happen last night any of that so thanks for your service but we don't get to use any of that sorry about that we don't even get to use this tape and I will just use it now because I mean why the hell not have Elizabeth Warren dancing at a rally but that's not an excuse to play in Seinfeld or looking like Kermit the Frog like that's she is that's electricity she did not have the electricity last night Joe Biden's case was basically I'm here I guess we have to do this thing I mean like we won't postpone it I'm going to call JFK you can trust me because I'm basically, toast go to the United States of America there's never been a single solitary time when we set our mind is something we're not able to do it or walking around their heads down like woe is me where the best-equipped nation in the how to take this on it's no longer trying to postpone we should get moving everything not do this anymore cast please please no more of this Alexia like the man who has to be wheeled in to perform the office of the presidency as always most honest person on the stage my boy Andrew Yang Yang the truth isn't and reading lights business too much at the same time he does have the most pure Democratic picture to hear some money there is a dream last night being like you get some money and you get some money and you get some money my boy Andrew Yang go for it my campaign will now give her Freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families someone watching this at home right now I'll Gates that's awesome it was awful last night like really bad last night. Okay last night and and you saw a couple of the other candidates for the mountains last night was terrible who in Castro was awful Beto O'Rourke is just the worst a bit of a Ruckus off the rails he thought that he was driving drunk and uncrossed median line was so bad they will get to all of that coming up in just 1 second first let's say that you were watching that debate last night and wanted

because basically I'm old enough to remember when Barack Obama claimed that Obamacare was going to cure Healthcare and that didn't happen and Now Dental cats like you know their health care if we tax the living bejesus out of you and also get rid of your private healthcare insurance and Joe Biden is over there like guys guys this is why Joe Biden continues to be a fairly solid candidate in the Democratic party right now there is Joe Biden really lashing out at at Elizabeth Warren this is the one moment where he lashed out of Warren had no answer for this is Joe Biden explaining your plan on Healthcare really blows its really a terrible plan I think we should have a debate on Healthcare I think I know that the senator says she's for Bernie well I'm for Barack I think the Obamacare work my plan for health care cost a lot of money it cost 740 billion dollars it doesn't cost 30 trillion dollars 3.4 trillion a year turns is twice what the entire federal budget is that's before it exists now without interest on the debt how we going to pay for it I want to hear tonight how that's happened so far I distinguish Rent-A-Center on my left is not has not indicate how she pays for it correct correct this is Joe Biden really does get in a solid shot against Elizabeth Warren and Elizabeth and this is a problem for Elizabeth Warren is Elizabeth Warren used to not be fully crazy aisle is Elizabeth Warren knows better than the stuff that she is saying right now and so she is uncomfortable with it right Bernie Sanders is not directed at Anders this why you went after 1 cuz he knows the Warren probably does not believe a lot of the things she says he's a True Believer at Bernie just let you go to Elizabeth Warren and Warren tries to slip the punch by claiming the taxes are not going to go up that you're actually going to save money since your employer is not going to have to pay for health insurance anymore and then there's a follow-up question to Elizabeth Warren and she's asked okay so do you really believe that employers are then going to take the money that they're not spending on health insurance and they're going to hand it back to all of the all of the employees I guess that's a good thing there's Elizabeth openly lying about taxing the middle class will middle-class taxes go up will private insurance be eliminated with I have to deal with and understand families are paying for their health care today families pay every time an insurance company says sorry you can't see that special in a debate with Donald Trump because she's going to say that in Trump's going to say you still haven't answered why you didn't pay for it you still haven't answered right aren't taxes going to go up just a yes or no this is very simple are taxes going to go up because everyone knows the answer to this in fact this is why people like Bernie because Brittany is at least Bernie Sanders Bernie going yep pretty much tax going to go up deal with it status quo over 10 years will be $50,000 every study done shows that medicare-for-all is the most cost-effective approach to providing Healthcare every man woman and child in this country I wrote the damn bill if I may say so intend to eliminate all out-of-pocket expenses study that says that all the other say it's going to cost an enormous enormous my money and buy you burning and you Elizabeth you're just not telling the truth the fact of the matter is it when a situation where you notice she had to answer the question this is about Candor honesty Big Ideas let's have a big idea there tax of 2% the Senators talk about 3 billion dollars guess what that means about twenty-eight billion dollar short the senator said before it's going to cost you and your paid there will be a deductible and your paycheck you're going to the middle class person someone making 63 kids they're going to end up paying $5,000 more for going to end up paying 4% more on your income tax that's reality needs a correct thing for an old codger badly last night there was Bernie Sanders talking about Healthcare and Biden coming back with a line that actually is not a terrible I'm glad it was pretty clear Troll and the United States of America we are spending twice as much per capita on Healthcare is the Canadians or any other major country on earth is America America or not Canada he is correct no people in the left and laughing at him but the fact is that when he says that he's not wrong the fact is medical Innovation happens here you want to have surgery or going to be able to get a surgery in the United States of America the fact is Healthcare outcomes in the United States are still pretty good when you remove all of the compounding factors in fact if you take away car accident deaths and homicide and suicide from the national statistics what you end up with is the United States is one of the top countries on Earth in terms of life expectancy so he's not wrong on any of this and again it was it was a rough paper boats on what we're going to have to answer these questions in a general election will get some more of that in just one second first hiring can be a challenge as portable co-founder of Gretchen heebner discovered what you needed to hire a game artist education tech company Juneau wouldn't be easy to find someone to grow with her team so she went over to ZipRecruiter ZipRecruiter does not

recording what's that it didn't happen and so you just decided you know what enough for this Rob you decide if you're going to go out and get another qualified candidate through ZipRecruiter you can make that happen insanely quickly Rob. That's something that we could do really quickly through ziprecruiter.com Cy ZipRecruiter is effective for businesses of all sizes try ZipRecruiter for free at our web addresses ziprecruiter.com daily wire that is ziprecruiter.com dailyware ziprecruiter.com daily wire ZipRecruiter is indeed the smartest way to hire and also my smartest way of threatening my employees ZipRecruiter the smartest way to hire go check it out right now so as I say you left this in the rice Baby Bernese all that but Bernie and Warren they bring at least it's honest Warren is not and that's why all the people who are singing warrants Praises after I'm not seeing maybe I listen I could always be wrong I can't gauge the minds of democratic voters but if she is a formidable candidate based on that performance last night I am not seeing it. Because she does not have brain answers for all of this stuff at Bernie's healthcare plan and she's exactly right I mean I thought that club I actually had a good night last night when it comes to our health care and what comes to our premiums I go with the doctors Creed which is Do no harm and well Bernie wrote the Bill I read the cell and on page eight on page eight of the bill it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it and that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current Insurance that's in four years I don't think that's a bold idea I think it's a bad idea is correct still believes that Stalin was great at his job but but but what is the board knows that in her discomfort with her own policy position was evident throughout the day now was it a universally good night for Joe Biden know it wasn't so who ain't Castro who's become the Kamikaze agent in this particular race find me he's just running into the middle of fields of fire and trying to take out other candidates in a desperate plea for attention so who in Castro he he went after Joe Biden and he was actually really dishonest about this so I'll play The Exchange and I'll explain why who and Catherine's actually lying about what Brian said he went in there with one agenda with Joe Biden and that is Saint Joe Biden is old President Joe Biden doesn't belong on the bed stage plays Super Bowl and who in Castro did that last night for the Chris Christie of the democratic party are the difference between what are supporting will you support Vice President Biden is it you require them to opt-in and I would not require them to opt-in they would automatically be enrolled they wouldn't have to buy in that's a big difference because Barack Obama's Vision was not to leave 10 million people on covered Katie wanted every single person in this country covered my plan would do that your plan would not have to buy in they do not have to buy it just said that you just said that 2 minutes ago you just said 2 minutes ago that they would have to buy it I'm fulfilling a fulfilling a legacy a bra Obama and you're not I'll be surprised to him saying that he is tied to Obama's leg is is correct so who is obviously attempting to you don't even remember what you said it's not true I can look at the transcript Biden said that if you can't afford insurance will be automatically enrolled in Medicaid either that's what he said but in any case that was the hit on on by last night and it's still the hit the Democrats think is going to take him out is that he's real old was awful last night but I did have a Godzilla Let Them Fight moment and that's when who and Castro and people to judge whether each other anymore smarmy candidate on stage it was pretty wonderful booty judge did the real fighting with each other why can't we all be friends and who ain't Castro was like this is a debate moron where is remind everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington born points against each other each other and telling each other that you're my plan we all know that's called Democratic primary election election is so irritating when people debating if public debate and tell me where can we all be on the same page as like it's a debate.. To Lancaster was terrible last night but I was really good that was really good and people to judge the service cuz he is insufferable he's become so insanely insufferable and he really showed it last night I drove to play you the the one other relevant Andrew Yang Club cuz anytime I have an excuse to play my boy Andrew Yang I'm going to the last night he just decided he knows a lot of doctors cuz he's Asian which is weird and somewhat racially discriminatory but sure go for it Asian so I know a lot of doctors and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork avoiding being sued and navigating the insurance bureaucracy after me and like I'm Jewish that means in a lot of accountants okay alright the rest of the Democratic Party named candidates are used to them at this point we're used to Bernie were used to buy more getting very used to Elizabeth Warren but some of the French candidates are helping shape help people see the Democratic party in that stuff is really good for President Trump and a second to the Democratic party ask about racism last night because this stuff is really terrible for the Democrats and every Democrat should be asked if they agree with Beto O'Rourke's view on American history that guy went from being feet supposed unifying moderate in Texas to being a wild left Howard Zinn spouting garbage machine a my goodness you know and I and I thought to myself how do I break out from the pack of Democrats me sure I skateboard and I do a lot of weed but how do I really break out like seven pages you know what I never thought it was before America is racist bra also threatened with unemployment is ZipRecruiter add you can go over there.

minutes I don't make it by tzumi stop by it was really great go check it out please subscribe we always appreciate it where the largest conservative podcast and radio so we've gone through some of the internal dynamics of the democratic party right now it's time to talk about what their agenda looks like the outsider so as I say if you had to sum up the Democratic topic by Topic in this particular debate on Healthcare it's we're going to take away your private insurance and raise middle-class taxes to do it so that sounds great I'll go forward America alternatively will do it but we'll just do it real slowly Biden's plan we get to racism hayride events are here is Beto O'Rourke after having read like seven pages of Howard Zinn in a late-night doobie been there is a year is Beto O'Rourke Desperately Seeking attention jerseys take on America it's not great racism in America is endemic it is foundational we can mark the creation this country not at the 4th of July 1776 but August 20th 1619 when the first kidnapped African is brought to this country against his will and in bondage and as a slave built the greatness in the success and the wealth but neither he nor his descendants would ever be able to fully participate in and enjoy I'm going to follow Sheila Jackson Lee's lead and sign into law a reparations Bill to allow us to addresses at its foundations we have a white supremacist in the white house and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country a racist murder on a national stage to Justin America's foundation in slavery not that slavery was a part of America's history and a horrible part of America's history that required the death of some 600,000 soldiers in the Civil War and The Bravery of millions of African-Americans and allies in the in in the Reconstruction Era South in the Jim Crow era in the civil rights movement and Trump is a white supremacist in the White House was Mortal threats people of color all across the country which should come as a shock to all the people of color all across the country who have jobs now because the economy is doing real well we have the lowest black unemployment rate in American history but apparently Trump wants to kill all the black people that's why he's luring the unemployment rate apparently is going around murdering all of the minorities and then they're not in the unemployment line so that that's obviously what they do at the end of this is just insanity is insanity and if you think that is that sort of stuff in a general election campaign the Democrats cheering cheering as he says that America was not founded on the 4th of July but in slavery and we are endemic Lee racist and what are things that makes Beto cell repellent as a candidate and now is a human being is that he isn't his race equivalent of the guy who declares himself a male feminist and the guy who says well you know it's not just that I scanned for female I just I'm a male feminist I'm more work than the females are Beto is more woke he's more wolf than anybody he's going to acknowledge is White Privilege electing the president make that white guy president so he can acknowledge is White Privilege from the White House Perfect Pitch Beto and then Cory Booker black people are in jail disproportionately because racism not because people get arrested for crimes and disproportionately those people happen to be minority but just randomly the police are just picking up black belts and throw him in jail which would be pretty wild that were true but it ain't so here's Cory Booker doing this weekend we have systemic racism it is eroding or Nation from Healthcare to the criminal justice system and it's nice to go all the way back to slavery but dear God we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased we get more African-Americans under criminal supervision today that all the slaves and 1850 okay then there's a difference this way is an 1850 didn't commit crimes maybe talk about people who are in jail that committed crimes convicted of crime slaves were innocent they were brought here against their will and then forced to work and give their labor to others at the point of the point of Sword effectively did you compare people were in prison now to slaves brought over against their will in many cases raped separated from their families this is insanity it's Insanity so you better come over here is Joe Biden watching his line and suggesting that nobody should be in jail for non-violent crime nobody has Bernie Madoff about to get out of jail that's exciting nobody should be in jail for non-violent crime as when we were in the White House released 36000 people from the federal prison system nobody should be in jail for non-violent crime like no one else like drug-dealing yeah I feel like I should probably be a jailable offense embezzlement that's something you should go to jail for the later he says what he meant non-violent drug dealers in prison or dealing drugs to children should they be in prison yes yes they should by the way the best majority people and we've gone through this dance before the vast majority of people in prison on the state and federal level are not there for nonviolent drug possession of fences what is a minut percentage about the state and federal prison population but we going to pretend this is all racism in all the right and this gets really wild tomato again just Leeroy Jenkins in the hell out of this thing Cory Booker literally came out this morning and he was like you know Republicans they keep after the Republican they keep saying that that this is fear that Democrats are going to confiscate the weapons that's fear-mongering is Cory Booker said and then and then Beto is just like saying I'm coming for your buddy yes we're going to take your AR-15 or AK-47 you are going to criminalize my ownership of an AR-15 that I committed a crime you're going to come to my house with the police and you're going to threaten to jail or shoot me if I don't hand over my weapon that I owned I take myself from criminals and from tyranny that's Beto's plan good luck with this in a general election cycle again Joe Biden desperately trying to cling on to moderation here and he's like grabbing the Hem of the democratic party talking about how you can't simply declare that you're going to take everybody's guns we have this thing called the Constitution and the crowd cheering cheering Kamala Harris saying we don't need a constitution nobody nobody cares about the Constitution anymore old man listen to this exchange the sound machine you can't do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive order does the vice president have a point there are some things you can many things you keep let's just let the senator answer what's a crazy language didn't you break out that joker laugh at me that is so creepy bleep and Biden let's be constitutional we've got a constitution and Kamala Harris likes all right all right Democratic party this is the route you want to go or in the morning jumped in and she's like you know what I just don't the filibuster we need to get rid of the filibuster for no charge of the Senate right now Mitch McConnell your do this thing to put up for a boat dumping the filibuster today and let's see how it was with Warren vote on it when it's Republicans and Chargers Elizabeth Warren what's the temp the filibuster then we can Ram through gun control and confiscation we have a congress for this book holder to the gun industry and unless we're willing to address that head-on and roll back the filibuster we're not going to get anything done on Dunns I was in the United States Senate when 54 Senators said let's do background checks let's get rid of assault weapons and with 54 Senators failed because of the filibuster okay also also if it had not been filibustered at this it happen when a Republican president veto power of veto any of Bill of the filibuster is there to provide yet another check and balance against a bare majority running roughshod over rights enshrined in the Constitution and I think this is radical stuff at the Democrats are proving themselves to be radical jumps into the game on immigration you just dumped out there's like yeah if you support Trump a racist and by the way you're going to hell really don't that last part that's been his pitch his pictures been as the holiest man on the stage 2 support late-term abortion and being the same sex marriage as a bible-believing person do not believe certain sections of the bible let me explain to you my campaign Black them anyway here's Pete buttigieg saying that if you support Trump you're racist to just to get that just to get the straight according to Beto America is deeply into stomach Lee racist black people are in jail basically at all is because of Criminal Justice racism and according to according to Beto and the rest of the democratic party Donald Trump is white supremacist racist murderer and according to be booted if you support Trump's immigration platform you're also a racist solid picture guys do you think that people to support President Trump and his immigration policies are racist anyone who supports this is so racist go go along with that you're supporting races and the best part of the democratic party right now is that they also don't have any solution are there places where they totally agree it's wrong but they just can't say so out loud and she met up with this bizarre situation where their policies look a lot like President Trump policy but they can't say it so I'm tryna there's broad bipartisan agreement that China is a national security threat to the United States but they are still in our intellectual property that they are pursuing Global ambition that they have built up their Regional power and that we have to do something about it every Democrat when asked about this that they refuse to just say yes I agree with the president about China here's what I would do differently instead it turns into Trump's all wrong about China also I'm going to do all the exact same things that that China at the trumps currently doing a thread this ridiculous needle a strategy that would include The Terraces leverage but it's not about the terrorist who has reduced the entire tryna challenge into a question of terrorists when what we know is that the terrorists are coming down on us more than anybody else and there's a ladder I would also use tariffs just like Trump is using tariffs Trump is bad for using the terrorists words I would be good for using the term salad salad and then Elizabeth Warren really is passionate and just like Trump does not understand the basics of international trade so she is much worse than from here is what she says about negotiating Trade Agreement which is about to say is patently insane patently insane she says that the way that we should trade policy in the United States is we should have American unions negotiate our trade policy with China yeah I was going to happen we're going to artificially you want to trade War have are unions in the environmentalists in the United States dictate trade policy two countries within which read that is a great way of never arriving to trade agreement ever for the rest upon because you know he's not going to abide by our Union rules I have a feeling China or anyone else you know he's not going to buy by environmental rules China or anyone else but she's working on China about his trade policy and then she's like basically I don't care if everybody to the insane change art free policy in America's first the procedures who sits at the table I want to negotiate trade with humans at the table I want a negotiated with small farmers at the table with environmentalists at the table with human rights activist at the table by herself and she seriously every answer that, Harris game last night is I'm going to unconstitutionally seized power and also I hate Trump so she's talking about China and she just randomly calls from is Italy smaller which is weird cuz from is actually fairly large human being there is are is Kamala Harris doing this routine and everybody cheering and clapping Donald Trump on trade policy and white guy in The Wizard of Oz you know when you pull back the curtain it's a really small dude it wow just wow that's that's pretty spectacular it also the Democrats being radical on foreign policy in which is obviously against what Joe Biden had to say I was Elizabeth Warren says we should withdraw all the troops and then we and then we will solve it with with diplomacy which is always at my favorite thing is when Democrats treated promise you like it's a strategy diplomacy is a tactic is not a strategy strategy is where you come up with a broad overarching plan for how you achieved your goal may be one of the pieces of that plan is diplomacy like Trump right now was trying to engage in diplomacy with the Taliban but Democrats seem to believe that if you just shout diplomacy at things then they saw themselves so around the problem diplomacy North Korea have nuclear diplomacy that's not a strategy idiots that's a tactic as you think diplomacy hasn't been attempted with Afghanistan you are completely foolish Elizabeth Warren tries to help us get our message Bernie Sanders just don't sit right out there just like I love the troops also we should buy all of them and take away all the money from The Bernie Sanders man owning it express our gratitude to all the men and women will put their lives on the line to defend defend Ox responded to the Call of Duty but I think also I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of Trumps military budgets I don't know you can do both of them should have jobs salad salad okay so it goes like this right climate change to declare that this is the day after tomorrow to Amy Klobuchar said and there was this amusing point where Bernie Sanders suggested it is unfair to call Venezuela socialist which is always fun but there is one more moment that is worthy of note and that is again underscoring main complaint against fighting which is that he's not with it so Biden was pretty alive last night look for it for a man who is not fully conscious who's barely alive last night and then there was this one moment as the debate wine on and it moved into its seventh hour last night Joe Biden started to lose some steam and he's asked about education and he ended up rambling about record players a great look if your friends are about accusations that you're too old and out of touch to be in the race start rambling about a technology that went out of style like before I was born then that ain't great here is Joe Biden rambling about record players hasn't answered education we bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children it's not that don't want to help they don't want they don't know quite what to do play the radio make sure the television base with me make sure you have the record player on at night make sure the kids here words a kid coming from a very poor school I got very poor background will hear 4-minute words spoken by the time I get there because of what he's going for here is there any studies that show that impoverished that that particular parents are single kids I mean based on that that language efficient that's what he's going for there instead from the phonograph put on the phone we need to photograph put on some Benny Goodman all right time for some very quick upgrades and then we'll get you a quick thing I like and a quick thing that you don't even do things I like the things I hate her the quickwrite last night's debate right by the field expectations but he had a couple of gas Bernie wasn't because Bernie is always be Warren was a CDS I thought that she didn't fulfill expectation booty judge was it because he's just terrible nobody cares because she's irrelevant Castro was an F because he's deeply annoying and horrible Cory Booker was Abby we didn't play any Cory Booker because he's not super relevant but I thought that he performed okay beta was an F because he's Kamala Harris was a d but shading into a nap cuz she was awful to and Andrew yang that doesn't look right those are debate great already well you know what we're not even to do things I like and things I hate because I had to expend too much energy putting together today show but if you want
