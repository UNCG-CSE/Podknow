promo code do the thing at checkout my name is Melissa Urban and you're listening to do the thing a podcast where we explore what's been missing every time you've tried to make a change and make it stick today is a little different than my other episode it all started with a story something I haven't done here yet I came home today after a 10-mile hike in the pouring rain which is normally something I would call church but not today today is like was more like a temper tantrum with God as the patient parent and me as the stubborn child when I got home shivering and sore and soap straight through I wanted to tell you more about today's journey I thought about an Instagram post but 2200 characters would not have done it justice so after a very long hot shower I sat down to record no notes no reduce much like on Instagram I never use the stories to tell you what to do I'm always just talking to myself here to preface the tail I'm answering one of the most common questions I get on Instagram why do you call hiking in the mountains church I'll give you the backstory how one fateful hike changed everything in terms of my relationship with God and what I say to those who suggest my version of church isn't as valid as the brick-and-mortar I will say this I use the word god a lot in this episode but if you don't believe in God or don't have a relationship with him or her please don't let that put you off I spent a lot of years resisting God and not listening to anything that started with or included the words God or Jesus I'm betting I missed a ton of good messages because I wasn't flexible enough to apply it in a way that works for me as I say in the episode whether you believe in God the universe Mother Nature or simply trust in yourself in the idea that your subconscious or gut will steer you in the right direction there's a message here for you the theme of today's podcast apparently is rain I spent all morning hiking in it and as I went to record the first section of the podcast later this afternoon it began to thunder and rain again I left it in as I mentioned in the episode my God is Not subtle and I read the message he's trying to send me through the rain today loud and clear maybe you will too now under the episode I'm going to answer a question that I get pretty often on Instagram whenever I post a photo or a story of me hiking usually in the Utah mountains but could be anywhere I always call going into the mountains and going on Hikes church and I got a lot of questions from people asking why I refer to it as church and what that means to me so I want to set up the story I'm about to tell you what just an explanation of why I call the mountains Church I grew up Catholic I did all of the CCD classes and first communion and confession all the way up through maybe when I was 16 I left the church after my parents could kind of no longer force me to go because I had a driver's license and a job and for other reasons that we don't need to go into in this particular podcast I became pretty resistant to the idea of organized religion I railed against the idea which Catholicism kind of imparted upon me that I was unqualified to have my own relationship with God that the only way I could have a relationship with God is through an intermediary and old white straight man who was in the Catholic Church who shared God's word with me and only through this intermediary what I be able to receive it now I'll add here that this was just my story about Catholicism given the way I was raised new experiences I had between the ages of 16 and 20 or 21 involving the church this might not be your interpretation of Catholicism or your experience going to the church that you go to so I'm certainly not saying that my story is the definition I'm just sharing my view of the church based on what I experienced and observed from a very young age so what was interpreted by me given this context was that the only relationship that I could have with God was one developed and cultivated through the church I did not like that I didn't like the idea and because I was at this point I'm about to enter into my drug addiction and I had other stuff going on thinking about God just kind of took a back seat so I left the church had no relationship with God I wouldn't have considered myself to have any spiritual practice whatsoever even when I was in rehab and had to go to NA meetings or AA meetings and talk about this idea of a higher power it still never really you like resonated or clutch with me because I had yet to do much work exploring my relationship with God it wasn't until maybe 2005-2006 that I started to think a little bit more about what this idea of God might look like for me I had been in recovery for five or six years but I felt like I don't know something was missing I had relationships at the time that prompted me to revisit this idea of not necessarily God but the universe this sort of all-encompassing energy that sort of guides and steers all of us that connects all of us and through that exploration I kind of read developed a relationship I wouldn't call it God at that point I was really freaked out by the idea talking about God but I would talk about the Universe I would talk about the energy or the current kind of pulling me you're pushing me or dragging me into something at time and that was really where my exploration began I tried we tried going to church here in Salt Lake City one side been to church like the physical building a few times with my sister and her husband in San Diego they are Christian and very devout and I enjoyed the experience in as much as I always think it's wonderful to hear people talk about their faith but it didn't really connect with me despite the fact that they were non-denominational Christian churches and they were very Progressive like there were rock bands and PowerPoint presentations which I also thought was really weird growing up Catholic and then seem like a Saturday Night Live skit played on a giant screen at church I just thought that was bizarre but regardless there was something about like the uniformity of the worship that again maybe it was just the the Catholic kind of shackles they still really bothered me I just couldn't quite get into the church scene fast forward to 2014 so there's a long Span in here where I was kind of poking around with the idea of God and spirituality maybe twine with the idea of church Christianity I Tried reading the Bible and never really stuck or resonated with me but in 2014 my son was one and my ex-husband and I were already separated that was a very difficult time in my life I felt like I had completely lost myself to this endless Litany of compromises that two people make when you're trying to save a relationship that was ultimately on salvageable there is a day here in Utah where I miraculously had an afternoon free I think maybe his dad was watching the baby and I decided to go out for a hike we moved to Utah specifically for the mountains but I hadn't really been super involved in the hiking scene here I'd gone out once or twice but wasn't an avid hiker at the time I decided to do this Trail up in Little Cottonwood Canyon where you go out to secret Lake it's called and it's only about a mile it's a short really kid-friendly Trail but that's the one I picked and then from Secret Lake I could see a peak and I looked up and I saw a little Trail kind of heading up towards this peak above the lake and I thought I feel good I should go a little bit farther so check the trail up and it's this trail that that kind of comes up and over onto a Ridgeline and when you get onto this Ridgeline you can seat over into the other Canyon and it is so drop-dead gorgeous it took my breath away I had never seen a view like this in my whole life and in that moment for the first time in the middle of this incredibly stressful and difficult situation the chatter in my head stopped experience the sense of Peace this silence is calm this presents what could only be in my mind. I'm not in that moment is where I Christen the mountains church I communicated on that hike for the very first time with God and I feel like I had created the space to listen and what it brought me was this sense of clarity and peace and comfort that was so strong I couldn't ignore it so that's where church was born in that moment on that hike during that really difficult time I went on to hike my little butt off after that I you couldn't drag me out of the mountains I hide as much as I could as often as I could I started planning all of my vacations around hiking and every time I would go out into the mountains I would notice that for the first half hour or so of my hike we're having a thunderstorm here I think it's actually kind of nice for the first half hour or so of my hike my head would not stop chattering and like at this point in my life my head was not saying very nice things to me so it would just be the constant just voice and negative voice that I wasn't doing enough I wasn't good enough it wasn't worthy enough but after about a half an hour it would calm and it would still and I would feel at peace I would feel grounded I would feel connected it would open up a channel for me to really think about my life and my stressors and how I could handle and process them better it would provide me with the open kind of bandwidth just to think about other things in my life and not be so hyper focused on this divorce and business blood and the situation that I was kind of stuck in at that time and when I got to my destination weather be a lake or a Mountaintop I really felt like I was closer to God up there then I was on the ground there was something about being out in nature with the leaves and the green and the air and the Sunshine and the sounds I would never hike with music or listening to podcasts I almost always hyped by myself I still do that's like my most prized solo time and I use that time specifically to connect with Mother Nature and the universe and God really long time the mountains were the only place I was able to get my head to stop chattering and to be able to connect with God so I hiked a lot I felt like I needed I crave that feeling of connectedness and faith and support that I got so I spent a lot of time in the mountains but with practice the more time I spent in nature communicating to God the more I was able to bring that connection back home with me and I would have moments when I was home just during a quiet moment at night I would have moments when I was with my son or I were purposely create moments where I would just be still and I guess you would call it pray I never really called it praying I always just called it talking to God but with the experience I had in the mountains I was then able to bring that into every area of my life and because of that now I feel like I talk to God all the time we are super tight because of what I've learned in the mountains as church he is or she is depending on how I choose to refer a just always there with me that is why I called the mountains my church because that's where I learned to talk to God and to receive him back much like you might Worship in four walls with your community I think you can worship anywhere I think that you can talk to God and he is super site to receive you absolutely anywhere you want to make that connection and of being in a particular place facilitates that connection for you whether it's the mountains or the beach or going for a run or playing with your kids whatever that looks like I think the important thing is that you're out there talking and creating space to receive and whether you think it's God or the universe whether you think it's some Universal energy that connects us all whether you're a complete atheist I still think this applies to you because in the silence and in the green spaces in in the sunshine and the open-air without the distraction you're more able to connect to yourself and even if that's what you believe in even if you believe in your elf in your intuition in your gut in your ability to listen closely to your subconscious and the signals your body and your mind or sending you to lead you in the right direction I think nature is the perfect place to facilitate that kind of conversation I'll sometimes get pushback from people who say that me calling the mountains church is somehow Blasphemous or somehow takes away from their Church which might be this giant marble stained glass with an ordained priest and a set schedule I could not disagree more again I go back to this idea that I think we should all be so pleased When anybody is connecting to God and God I'm guaranteeing is super duper sites whenever anyone wants to connect with them or her or whatever you want to refer to them as so you know what I guess I would say that your fear or anxiety around my definition of church doesn't really say anything about me and I would invite you to ask yourself why the idea of someone worshiping in a way that's just a little different than yours is threatening to you I get so much out of my time at church and I'm not the only one you are now sending me your photos of your time in church and sometimes that looks like a park sometimes it looks like the beach or a lake or a mountain or a yoga mat and I'm always thrilled to hear you embracing the concept in the idea I didn't have a relationship with God for such a long time because it was stuck inside my head that I wasn't qualified to Define my own relationship with God and to create it exactly the way I wanted to and make it look the way that I wanted to I wish someone had told me a long time ago he Melissa you can make this look anyway you want you can talk to God anywhere anytime any how you can listen anywhere anytime any how you can worship anywhere anytime anyhow I wish someone had told me that it took me a lot of years to discover it but maybe by sharing what my idea of church is with you all of the various ways that you could approach it based on exactly what you choose to believe and what you want to get out of the relationship with whatever you want to call it might be the thing that you've been missing and helping you explore your own version of spirituality or connectedness whether it's with God or the universe or Mother Nature or your fellow humans or just with yourself

part of this episode today I'm going to do something a little bit different I'm going to tell you a story, like I would on Instagram but without the character limitations my ego just got back from a 10 and a half mile hike you could call it church maybe but it felt more like me being in a fight with the universe and spoiler I lost because that's what happens every time I fight with the universe back in June I was really struggling with I guess life in general I was feeling really overwhelmed with work stuff with post-concussion stuff relationships my physical fitness there's no area of my life that didn't feel unsettled and topsy-turvy after a weekend at Revitalize the retreat with mindbodygreen particularly a conversation I had with my friend Kelsey Patel I was talking to her about how I was feeling really overwhelmed and I have these like stressful things coming up and I didn't know how I was going to balance or handle it all and she looked at me and she said have you tried giving it up to God and I immediately thought oh of course because no I hadn't and I know from past experience that when I wrestle with God or the universe or my Intuition or my God whatever Force you feel like is leading you towards your highest self and towards growth whenever I fight with Force I experienced a lot of pain things feel harder than they should they feel more chaotic than they should I feel more power less than I should this is an experience I've had many times so I feel like I should have recognized it so during our conversation I thought about why I was kind of continuing to Russell for control with the universe and she sent me some Reiki while we were talking and I came home really committed to giving this up to God and what I mean by that is just sometimes I feel like there are things in my life that are so big and unknown and scary or anxiety-provoking or just so complicated or difficult that I don't know how to handle it by myself and I have a lot of faith in God and the universe and mother nature which I will use interchangeably to steer me towards what is in my best interest so over the course of the first few meditation sessions I had when I got back home I made a conscious deliberate pitch to God and said I am feeling really overwhelmed I need help with this I am going to release this to you to my Spirit guides to the universe help me move my ego out of the way and act in a way that serves my highest self and after I did that I felt an enormous sense of peace and relief that lasted for about a month everything just felt easier my schedule hadn't changed the issue setting change to like nothing was different except that I felt like I had some backup and how I was choosing to handle this and that made a huge difference I felt so much more centered and grounded and capable and empowered and that piece but like with many commitments if you don't continue to revisit them and recommit to them and remind yourself of why you made the promise in the first place they can start to kind of Trail off and recently I felt like that giving it up to God has trailed off I tend to want to Russell control back from the universe as much as possible despite knowing that in the past that only leads to pain and suffering I still try to do it from time to time and I've really been feeling like that lately and last night in particular I just I had a really difficult night where I felt like something had to give and so I decided this morning that I would wake up very early and go to church I would go to my mountains by myself and I would hike because that's where I feel the most centered and grounded that's where the chatter in my head stops that's where I feel like I can connect to Mother Nature and the universe the easiest and I thought this is a great opportunity for me to Center myself and come back but I woke up this morning I got a text as I was prepping in the morning from Brandon saying hey it's kind of raining does that change your plans and I thought well I can handle you know a little bit of rain I looked at the weather it look like it was in the valley at least going to stop raining by about 8 a.m. and it was only about 6:30 I thought no I'll be fine I'll go I'll be fine so I get started on this hike which is a 10 and a half mile hike it's not raining until I get maybe a mile in and then it starts raining pretty hard and I thought okay I've got my not my shell shell but I've got my like windbreaker show my water-resistant windbreaker on this is you know it's like a Long Trail but it supposed to stop raining pretty early I'll just so I kept going about I would say to miles and it started to pour like downpour and I thought this is kind of a sign I should turn around and go back because I'm not going to enjoy this hike and there you know that being super wet on a 10-mile Trail and the temperature also was like 20 degrees chillier than it was when I was in the valley so I was slightly underprepared which is not like me but I had shorts on I only have this light windbreaker I'd one more layer in my bag but I didn't want to pull it out cuz I didn't want it to get wet I thought I should turn around and go back and this is where I started to like fight with the Universe I thought to myself no I said I was going to hike and I'm going to hike and like this is where at my intention of going to church which involves self love and compassion for the self and Grace and a willingness to not just talk to universe but allow space to listen this is where all of that went out the door I was like nope I said I was going to hike so I'm going to hide so I keep going it starts raining harder and harder like to three miles in it's super muddy the trail is really Rocky so it's wet I'm not happy I'm soaking wet I'm starting to get really cold my fingers are like I tried to pull my phone out to take a picture on bikes it was pretty though it was raining and my fingers were not cooperating they were so cold and Frozen that like I couldn't get my phone to work so I thought okay but I kept going now I had not seen anybody on this Trail except for one person who I happen to know so on the way up my friend from the gym past me I was like oh my gosh hey she's like someone that we talked about going hiking together off and she was like I just thought I'd come out for the psychiatrist texted you last night and I was like yeah I was going to do a different hike but it's raining so I picked this one she was liking faster than me so she kind of kept going about a mile and a half from the lake so this is like three and a half miles into this hike I see her coming back towards me and it was like too soon for her to have gone to the lake and come all the way back so I was like a what's going you know are you done and she goes yeah she's like I'm freezing cold it's pouring rain there's a lot of water rushing up there like it just feels like I should turn around and go back this was another sign the only person I had seen on the trail happen to be someone I know and happen to be someone who is turning around hiking back I could have had back with her and had like a really nice pleasant journey back but now I'm in a fight with the universe so it's pouring rain I'm soaking wet I'm unprepared I get an invitation to hike back down the trail with someone I know in like greatly but did I turn around nope and that I kept going hand to God not more than like 30 seconds after I left her to go up the trail I hear a giant boom of thunder and a crack of lightning my God he's not subtle he is like as East Coast as they come very very direct so I get to thunder and lightning and I'm thinking to myself you should really turn around this is no longer a like I can toughen the conditions this is a safety issue you should not be on a mountain in a thunderstorm it's like not a good place to be but now this feels personal like I am in a pissing contest with God right now and I am not going to back down its it felt like one of those moments where God was like really do you want to be in control in this moment and I should have just taken me out and said cool I hear you loud and clear I'm going to like check myself and go back down this hill and take this lesson for what it is which is a gift and reconnect to giving this up to you to letting go of control to restoring my faith and seeing this as like a really powerful example of how connecting with the universe serves me in every area of my life that's what I should have done did I do that no I kept going I have another mile and a half to go it gets really Steep and then it gets wide open you, come around the corner and you're on this Ridgeline over this giant Bowl which is gorgeous but it gets really windy so I'm in this really thin windbreaker that normally blocks away and pretty well but it's now soaked all the way through my underlayer is totally soaked my shorts are totally so my shoes are muddy and so and now I have this giant blast of cold air coming right through me I am shivering at this point but I only have like another maybe half mile to go and I'm going to fight with the universe so let's keep going so I check on I get around and then you end up I can see the lake but you have to go down quite a bit to get to the lake so I get down to the lake I'm like okay I'm here except I can't enjoy any of it it started raining again so now it's pouring at this like it's still windy I am freezing cold and as soon as I stop moving I can't feel like my hands my legs are bright red shivering uncontrollably and as I start unlike okay while I'm here I'll at least go down and take a picture as I start walking down towards the lake I realized that it is a field of mud so everywhere I step if I'm not on a boulder I am sinking my shoes into like mud I am no longer having fun except again I'm in a fight with God still like the hell I kind of don't know whether I want to laugh or cry I'm more wanted to cry because mostly I knew that I had another five miles to just get back to my car so I get to the lake I snapped like to quit pictures with my frozen claw hands and I start the hike back up I get back up to the Ridgeline and I stopped to take one more picture and I look at my phone and my battery is completely dead I don't know how in the span of like 40 minutes my battery went from fine to completely dead but my phone is. There's nothing else I can do and I thought well played God well played no photos for Instagram okay now I just want to get back down to the bottom of the mountain this is not restorative this is not church this is not me talking to God this is like me pitching the biggest temper tantrum I can find ignoring every I know that the universe is sending me to just like stop and surrender and like give up control in this moment and say that there are some things that are just bigger than me but do I know so I hiked down the mountain as fast as I can at this point because I'm so cold I pass a like one or two people on the way up I passed one guy at one point he looked at me and was like are you okay and I was like I'm very cold so I had down the mountain as fast as I can my legs are so cold at this point that I and it's a very Rocky Trail that I'm like tripping and stumbling at one point and twisted my ankle like I've lost all sense of sure-footedness I think at this point because I'm a little bit scared and a little bit connect and like definitely on the verge of tears and also colder than I've ever been in my life so I hiked down the trail at the kind of fork where I know there's less than a mile to go and it starts to hell it was like just one last little I don't know I can send I can like hear the universe chuckling at this point like okay you got back to your car but how's that working for you Melissa how did this work for you and that's how I feel through the hole like entire course of this hike it wasn't a vengeful God it wasn't a petty God it was like a very parental question to me every step of the way how's this working out for you Melissa and I got to tell you by the time I got to my car I open the car I could barely get my backpack off cuz my hands were so numb and I just burst into tears and then I crank the Heat and shivered 45 minutes until I got home and got into a hot shower and that is literally where I'm talking to you from right now is just fresh out of the shower finally no longer shivering wanting to get the story down before I forgot the details but more important before I forgot how it made me feel I've been to church once since I moved to Salt Lake City 10 years ago a physical church with a building and a pastor but I will never forget the sermon that that Pastor gave that day I think it's called The Sermon even if you're not Catholic right it was a non-denominational church during the sermon the Pastor said we feel like we are moving away from God we are pushing God away we are rejecting him we're not listening to him we don't want to hear what God has to say we want to like handle it ourselves and we feel like we're moving further and further away but anytime you are ready to turn around and reconnect with God you will find he is always right there and that stayed with me because whether you're talking about God or your Spirit guides or the universe or Mother Nature or you're just talking about yourself I think we all feel like there is something in us that guides us to make the right decision to live in our integrity to move forward into growth and there will be times where we push that away I don't want to do it I don't want to hear it I'm not ready for it but the more we push that away that intuition that got sense. Sensation that like the universe is moving us towards something for our highest self the more we push that away the more painful it becomes it provokes this sense of real like physical tangible anxiety or unease or discomfort but still we feel like we want to remain in control we feel like we're not ready for that message we feel like week handle things all by ourselves and yet eventually I find there comes a Breaking Point a moment where I think to myself this is untenable and I need to go back to my face because my faith is what holds me up it is what guides mean it is what serves me and I find it so incredibly comforting to think that in that moment when I am ready all I have to do is turn around thanks for joining me today on do the thing you can continue the conversation with me at Melissa underscore heart we go on Instagram and visit whole30.com podcast for today's show notes and bonus content if you have a question for dear Melissa or a topic idea for the show leave me a voicemail at 321-209-1480 do the thing is part of the onward project a family of podcast brought together by Gretchen Rubin all about how to make your life better check out the other onward project podcast happier with Gretchen Rubin side hustle school and happier in Hollywood finally before you leave please subscribe leave a review and invite your friend to do the thing see you next week from the onward projects
