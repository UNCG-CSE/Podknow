text Cynthia Myers welcome back to max out everybody this is that my lap today is not a normal program I have a true American hero sitting across the table from a here today so if you don't recognize this face let me tell you who he is this is Robert O'Neill and fat lot of sports people on here a lot of entertainers that in most people's minds are heroes and then in life you meet a real hero is inconsiderate of one but he is one and so let me give him a proper introduction just so you know who this man is 52 decorations in the military to silver stars for bronze star medal with Valor joint service Commendation Medal with Valor three presidential unit citations to Navy marine and navy core combinations with Valor service for different combat missions 400 if you watch the movie Captain Phillips this is the first guy on to the boat when the Somali pirates had that boat if you watched Lone Survivor with Marcus Luttrell he was on that recovery Mission and by the way he also killed Osama Bin Laden and so thank you for being here I appreciate that the Captain Phillips a I wasn't one of them was not one of the shooters I was Ali jumper for that and the snipers that were there with really no no time we're just watching to make sure nothing unsafe happened when the shot was incredible and amazing because I'm not just being here so thank you how's that for a hero everybody and so we're going to get into the mind of this man that they were talk about team building what he's up to today and obviously some of the great things that you've been a part of it on the team you're part of himself as being a part of the team both you and I know that but then there's a blessing when when we when the opportunity arrives we need it with our preparation which is what you'd never the perfect plan because that's never going to happen just like we will get into it later to put the bin Laden raid we had the perfect plan and nothing nothing came of it happened happened when I go to that first before we get to that I'm just curious why I was going to call the basketball and I was going to work with my dad when I got out of college and I got dumped by a girl and wanted to leave Butte Montana, the first operator it says I owe my career as a Navy SEAL to a girl and that was an accident too cuz I didn't want to join the Navy I want to join the Marines and I wanted to be a sniper and so I went to join it is again as luck would have it and then recruited wasn't in there the Navy guy was sitting there and the only reason that I went to to the Navy guy is because I had two friends I grew up with Ben and Jim who were Marines to the two years older and they told me that the Marine Corps is actually part of the Department of the Navy it's just the men's department so I'm going to ask him where's the when she come back from lunch Anyone why do you want the marine and I said I want to be a sniper at he's a chief in the Navy look no further slowly set come on this guy talked me into it cuz I remember being so dumb I'm like I'm naughty but this guy's a professional recruiter why would he lie to me and that's it and then he showed me the videos of the crap I mean I don't know if you strike a swim and I said well I'll be positive about I'll just go to San Diego I see the school training I probably won't make it but then I'll go to the police and be in the Navy have see stories when I come back home to Maloney's bar if you Montana but then I made it through are you being serious because the other recruiter no-shows because of the girl yeah oh my God both of them went to join the army with someone dumped a Navy SEAL but couldn't swim I ran into him by luck to it the full he was like I've never seen you at the pool before what's going on I thought I'd join the Navy and I'm going to be a seal he goes oh no not like that you're not so you know the breaststroke go inside so it doesn't happen for you or to you and happens for you right in these things all it's amazing that the guy who ends up killing the most evil person of our time and show up in the Seal program by mistake by the Fall because of a girl a semi-decent shape white kid that can't swim from Butte Montana and ends up in lawns bedroom is because of a positive attitude doesn't matter what you look like or where you're from you can do anything just keep your head of the operator the sores are similar and it's your sense of humor is like the southern once you start reading it on it's just a group do it like you cannot stop reading this book maybe it's cuz it's actual real stop in a day and I'm telling you like I was trying to get rid of other appointment I had to finish reading a book so get this money into reading the audio book to hear every gurgle this is pretty goddamn so the big things in our life never show up the way we envisioned ever and I get another word when you were 12 year old boy this was your dream your picture what was going to be a defining moment of your life was not being in a room with Osama Bin Laden right now so how amazing how many does Chase your dream bust your ass not positive attitude at a Seal Team that could potentially get them on when he was we don't know where the hell he was aware in Iraq fighting and we wouldn't even mess with people I was a battlefield interrogator which means you take the house down you get the men and you question if you know what I mean like messing with guys and I would say that who's the man of the house where is the mosque and I would say where's the song come on and we would both laugh but no one knows where he is a member of that game going to get them that's never going to be there is going to be the army guys again so let's you start to a did you know when you were prepping yes that you were prepping for him they told us about three weeks before we left it was Bin Laden and I was one of the coolest things because at first they started with they call us when we just finished a deployment I think it was my 12th combat appointment we're on a diving trip in Miami we would do a training trip but I was always a good deal like diving in Miami climbing in Vegas right timing that's enough but not that anyone has been in the ocean has had a positive encounter with a shark and don't realize it was a young great white so you're prepping the senior guys back because I was one of them my number two was my boss was there and we sat in a room in the first thing they said is well here's the deal this isn't a drill we found a thing and sting is in a house this house is in a bowl and some mountains near Lake in a country and you guys are going to fly in there and you're going to get this thing and you going to bring it back that's it that's okay no problem what's the thing can't tell you where is where's the bowl can't I can't tell you how much are support do we have an answer so we assumed it was because the Arab Spring 2011 whatever they want to do I put two and two together and and they drove us down to where they gave us a day with day at home with our kids and we drove down in the net the commanding officer from for my Seal Team he walked in the room is, Severance try guys reason you're here is this is as close as we've ever been to Osama Bin Laden what happen to your body when you are done a little bit of a little bit of Goosebumps but I've heard reports of shares of Hi-5 it was what I looked around and everyone's professional fees are very professional Navy Seals and the first question was cool are we going right now to do it already and they said we'll know you need to we need to show you everything and then they're like five options are we going to bomb this way by man that way and they actually said are you going to do a multilateral mission with the Pakistani military option so they've been powers-that-be wanted to see a strange place out west that I'm not allowed to talk about and then we forward launch to jalalabad Airfield just in case the president gave us the green light Newton President Obama was really cool about it because one person that was sure Bin Laden was there and she was the famous three-letter agency woman 100% he's in this house on the third floor why aren't we going now really he's there is she the same as you see her in the movie looks a little different Jessica Chastain nailed it and he was just cool letters that look after hearing about your training I wasn't 100% sure he was there but I was a hundred percent sure you guys could go in find my gosh that's why we got the how long was the training to prep for you at least two weeks and so then you do you only end up getting a phone call to gather you and we're going tomorrow or what the weather will be returning to different areas we had a train on those stealth helicopters that the pilots who don't get nearly enough credit because they never flown over before we we knew we were going to go over there I think about Monday or Tuesday just to be there in case they call us were ready to launch from Afghanistan to close the base to the Border okay and so what we knew we were going say goodbye to the kids which is hard because we waited they were coming back from that mission we thought it was if we get the green light it's a one-way Mission but you're going to die if you knew you were going to die in your teammates also know this as well as the technology works we don't know how good their air defenses are maybe the the young kid that's very aggressive is on the radar that night there are no checkpoints people that are usually checkpoints to refuel there aren't there none of those so we have to be exact with a pound of weight that we have so we get shot down if anyone's going to blow himself up in his entire family when the teams in the house Bin Laden will do it yourself in his entire family and there's 23 guys in Pakistan we invaded them we have nowhere to go at we end our lives in a Pakistani prison we don't know what I had a guy on the team that he ended up being the guy that was in front of me going up the stairs the last set of stairs that that said don't get me wrong I'm not I'm I'm going a hundred percent going in the mission but I have to say this out loud to hear it if we know we're going to die why are we going what did you say we had a conversation decided was the best way to put it into perspective is when I'm going after the lawn for fame what I'm going after deadline for money we are going for the single mom who dropped the kids off at elementary school on a Million Tuesday morning and 45 minutes later she jumped to her death out of a skyscraper because that was a better alternative than 2500 degrees Fahrenheit in cider last gesture of human decency was a horse cart to Ernie's so that no one can see your underwear she killed herself and we said she wasn't supposed to do that she's not supposed to be the fight we're supposed to be in the fight and that's why we're going the Braveheart speech and if I could give every day from being 34 290 if I leave the ninety and I look back on that one day and I didn't go I would give all those days to go on this Mission this is why we're here is what we're doing this is why this is not a movie though your real men these are real decisions are my children yes but I'm going to see them again you literally said goodbye looking him in the eyes and your them too much to have a reason to work but one was just there all the time and then when I left for that she was 7 and I I wrote her a letter and it would but I didn't write it to the seven-year-old I wrote it to the 27 I'm really sorry I missed your wedding I know you're beautiful thank you for take care of your sisters what we did was noble and just ended and one of my regrets in life I had to hand them to I had to find someone I can trust on the basis of guys going with her right now. Either they're dying to oh my God what to do when you don't even know we're doing you couldn't tell him you'll know you need it as soon as I got back at them and I wish I would have experienced even to this day to have been writing those letters and thinking you were. the feeling was so cool because when when would President George Bush address the world on 9/11 his quote and have a tattoo that says a freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward and freedom will be defended and when you said free will be defended him and everyone in that team represented everyone's oh my gosh oh my gosh so you get the call and now as I understand it there's this helicopter ride over and it's not as short as 90 minutes right and so there's all kinds of situations that could happen on the way over there as well as for the pilots for Paws in the world world in Armenia, give me a shout out that they have the best helicopter pilots in the world there there this Market there the guy that made against it and we're in the back and was really unique about this team is guys have been in, so much we realize you got to get rid of annoys get rid of the stuff it doesn't matter like getting shot down you worrying about that will not stop so knock it off so guys fell asleep guys fell asleep on the ride to Bin Laden's house my God oh my God I was counting military stuff not being a military person that that's actually something kind of the senior guys passed down sometimes to Junior goes to did you learn that Prince of Bel-Air on my own as a sniper in Kosovo because right around 9:11 we were in Kosovo there was on the corner of Oz now and we snipers not really a great work but we were observing different area so basically you're hiding and you're looking through a scope for 4 hours on four hours off and you're looking 4 hours of looking like I just count you count yet okay so did you not then eventually sort of repeat that phrase to yourself too and we back to the South and I was just like you know 456-450-7458 Freedom itself was attacked this morning by faces got to know how I remembered I'm actually on this Mission if you work that's when it sunk in yet we're going and then it got better because we we open the door at two minutes out they feel they are true in situ they are true guys we would have figured the doors out near you guys did it so they don't open the door and then you see the city and there's lights is a resort town There's a golf course and a sort of hit me and I was like this is some serious Navy SEAL shit we're about to do everything was great and then I'll hit the fan this beat everyone understand this so the helicopter in front of you crashed this was clearly not part of the plans room good lesson the second he realized he couldn't have her then he realized we try the power of each latest me I'm a pilot then he tried to power up is going to roll and everyone dies he knew he spun it he could put the tail on the wall. Yeah we practice fast-roping what I've ever try and see only person to fastrip on the bin Laden mission was a pilot that we didn't you didn't know he didn't know and so he our plan was never going to put our snipers and our dog Cairo outside and then they're going to put us up on the rooftop yet and we knew our team would be coming from the bottom now we're going to get in that we can't get out that's a perfect plan poke never happened and just because of the effective communication nonverbal communication I guess we're getting out here to put in my right foot on the ground and saying I guess we start the war from here and then we go to the northeast corner with me to the place inside and it was it was nice that we trained so much as we knew everything about it we knew there was a double door on the northeast corner so we went over that our preacher took it I think a 7-foot charge sc6 put it on the door and he blew it and it open like a tin can but there's a brick wall behind it so it's a fake fake fake he's in there because that means we get smaller and smaller a small enough of the door this big in the calendar I had one of my guys say but now I'm not nervous we do this every night we play some what we talked with some people fly back he just wasn't play we thought they were saying - 1 going around - 1 going around meaning they came in the harbor and is - 1 1-2 and it took fire so we thought they were going around racetrack we attack what they were saying was - 1 going down so we said to them cuz we thought they were flying where is it okay there's another there's a carport but we called it another double door that we knew work cuz the imagery show them driving in and out of it and we should I wear going to blow the car for now. And they said don't blow it will just open it the other guys for their inside now we didn't know that and it didn't make sense of the door open now it's another point in life it didn't make sense why they're there but that doesn't matter cuz they're there we'll just we'll just let's deal with the problem we'll talk about it later worrying about how this happened we're just here so we still going in nothing but won't Leiden and a couple other guys on the helicopter we didn't know they crashed but they're in there so we start now my guys have been in gunfights already killed three the terrorists before I got in there and I was fortunate because of my position now I'm in the back I get I have a front row seat to the pools Mission modern history yes so we can win and we're looking at his house and is it going to blow up your head but I was so impressed by guys were so cool no one no one cared about the bombs there their they're doing their job and I remember thinking about how cool they are and it's taking slow is smooth smooth is Fast Watch ducked into a room to look down the hallway cuz don't stand in the hallway to shoot down the hall with the guy next to me said helicopter crashed and now I'm thinking we had two big helicopter to Schnucks 45 minutes behind us full of other seals in case we need to do whatever so I'm assuming they stop processing this entire compound it to keep a plumber headed dog with a minute and then a dog handler and he got to that famous spot where the the tail is hanging over and he came over the radio and Beyond at work they are definitely ready for us they have a soup that a training mock-up of our super-secret helicopter in the front yard play some where is Osama bin Laden really get a drink when you're more aware but it just more exciting. I'm not scared to found a lot and said I don't know what the inside of the house looks like but you will find some stairs and when you find the stairs you will run into Khalid Bin Laden who's that will be the last line of defense If you eliminate that threat you will get a shot at the big guy that's awesome. I'm about eight guys hey guys back if I'm still in the back their sakhalin he was armed and he ducked behind a banister now it's dark it's very quiet we don't talk to each other and there's a guy up for the appointment and normally in an urban environment in a house fighting upstairs I'm going to grab all the guys back and let like two or three hand looks as if they Chuck and Renee they come down here we go fight up and but now I'm going to die anyway and I got it I got to watch this I got to see how he had to get up in the thing with you and when can you come here in in in Urdu and Arabic you know why he was where he was I never thought of that that was the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life up until about 4 and it is a final stairwell going up the point man stayed there staring you know he's going to he's going to keep Point keep security and other guys are going to clear the second floor cuz you don't want to move past it clear that and then that's everyone in front of me on the last guy I had a two-man so the one that's on the two-man and that's when I put my hand on his shoulder cuz his job is to look forward my job is to look behind us and when we have enough guys I will squeeze you so you know without looking weird it's time to go but it's just us guys we don't have enough and he start at the top of the stairs and you seen people moving they've got to be suicide bombers maybe we can beat him maybe we can be so he's convincing me we got to go but I wasn't thinking bravery I'm thinking all right we're going to get blown up now and I'm tired of thinking about it what's get it over with as much reason why the stairs he open the curtain and there was two or three people that turned out to be women but when is suicide bombers it doesn't matter so he jumped on when is March of the Black Sea can for the guy behind him he didn't know it was me so because I got there because he went that way my job is to go that way based on our tactics I wasn't I wasn't bravado I just turned and there's a some of them on standing there and he's got his hands on his wife's shoulders and he sort of pushing her I don't know what he's doing but when I go through the Rules of Engagement levels escalation of force I can close my eyes and see it it's he's taller than I thought he's skinnier than I thought that his beard is shorter and gray that's his nose that has been Laden he's not surrendering uses is a threat I need to kill him and the way you haven't got a little criticism about what you shot him in the face and what about recognition people that say that I've never dealt with a suicide bomber very fast very sudden loud scary and permanent a shot in the face twice. Him again and I moved his wife has hands on her she looks nice but I moved his his wife to the bed to sit her down and when I looked over his two-year-old son was staying there and as a father I remember thinking this poor kid has nothing to do with this and you should have seen that so I picked him up oh my God and I put him on other Navy Seals are not coming in the room and that's when it hit me so I'm just standing there are you good and I said no what do we do now I'm asking two days and he said he laughed his smile is now we go find the computers or we do this every night and I went yeah you're right I'm back home to change it back to work because it's not like we ever did was get it over with to complete shock to now we might live we might we might We Gather the stuff they had about three offices in the second-floor we're Gathering everything from anything electronic smashing hard drive to get the towers at harddrive anyting and then we put him in a body bag myself and three other guys walked him out you walk him out that we carried amount can we go back for a second when I ask you when you shot him I'm just curious if there's this moment so you you Tim yep you got your finger on a trigger I suppose is there any can you remember can you process was there any emotion at that time any thought in your mind or you just executing what you've been prepared to do I had a feeling he was off to the right when I turned in when I saw him had he like had no shirt on and surrendering he's getting taken a lot but they're just there is such suicide bombers have have less than a second convince you not to kill of course and it's just it's one of those things different Dynamic executor to distribute 10 seconds later you carry him out of there of the sniper who initiated the fire rescue Richard Phillips which is really cool you got to leave forget about the women and children let's go cuz we had the guns with this week he's outside live-tweeting you could I forget his name but you can still see it on the internet. And he saying stuff like wire why are the pakistanis doing military drills on a Sunday night in his phone and normally a combat zone Iraq Afghanistan if some of the outside of a target with a phone out you shoot them because they're setting off a car bomb but I looked at this kind of like they have no idea we're here so that we didn't helicopters and we fly out is not the same helicopter which is awesome seals getting seals on top of the the the sniper that the Captain Phillips think dealing with high-profile is jealousy in there with guys at that level and I kept telling him and you were here oh and don't listen to the negativity you're here like I would always give him and I'm still processing what just went down he has me Copenhagen have one of mine are you know what it's like to be here to me from the other Seal Team that came to get us he I know him well he's from Manhattan and he asked me the first question that every Navy SEAL ass when they found out about the mission he said who got them and I said I did and he said on behalf of my family thank you and and you realize we got 90 minutes and you're still in their airspace so we take off everyone starts to watch has no one's talking you just look at your watch 10 minutes it's been 20 minutes 30 minutes thank you Stadium top of the Sexes I'm not going to say anything but 50 minutes 60 70 80 and then I love sports analogies I was just like Miracle on Ice we can hear the crowd counting down when the Americas are beating the Russians Lake Placid 10 9 8 end of the pilot came over the radio for the first time in your lives are going to be happy to hear this welcome to Afghanistan we were all there no one's hurt oh my God I had a brief talk with a problem with the movie Zero Dark Thirty at the end of the movie they they have the woman that sound and go up to the body and she gets emotional when she cries and she believes that's not what happened to the appointment we kind of deatrice each other one that was what the hell happened on the stairs to this him and meet you and then he goes there she is unique because you need to give her something cuz you won't miss this is what he said so we walked over and I pulled the magazine out of my last one out and I said you have what is in your backpack and she looked up cool as everybody I think so then we were the ones that walked over to the body and Admiral walking over and starting to sink in that that this one gave her life for him she no husband no kids 20-hour days for years to find this guy then it's like well this is a story to this is like this is Norman this is Washington cross the Delaware we need to fight the questions so I got to say some cool so we walked over and we looked down and all I said was is that your guy she looked down for a second and a half and said well I guess I'm out of a fucking job and let me say that this is the best story I've ever heard the best story about working I tried to Corner shot three times and we left because we were a year the day after Bin Laden raid I had my kids at Great Wolf Lodge with a water park yet and we have the news on one year anniversary brawl getting changed to go swim have a great day and I got beer there so I'm excited for you and I'm the news is on and they said okay so when your head of Nursery of the night Bin Laden was killed so we're taking viewer email right now the best story of where you were when you found out there on the bed and tell him you were going to Spencer in the bedroom all my God I'm just I've heard a lot of stories I mean even look at our guys this is like it's just unreal in the way you tell it was such an incredible humility is just beyond belief and I understand clearly that this would not have happened just with you it was obviously all the preparation the intelligence the team-building all of those eggs but it's it's it's hard even for me to process how humble you are about having a mattress on a thank you, on behalf of all of these families who lost so many people and it's just unreal to me that the the the caliber of man that's involved in this Mission and how humble they are about it just absolute we blows my mind I'm looking at even our fault that you still have the sense of humility about I just like the guys that went in where we're smart enough to carry guns in a sledgehammer and recording office is that going to a different branch of the military can't swim ends up becoming a seal ends up doing 400 different combat missions probably the most significant of all of them is this one and you end up being the man God called on whoever called on to be the point man to end this man's life is just un-freakin'-believable to credit store at The Point there's no way we did that I just know the story yeah what is for you call the stairs what it was like going up that last few steps of life but then getting life after I can when I squeeze this man you're probably dying bathing us an improvised explosive device that's it I'm done I'm done worrying about it it's interesting for me it's a bizarre takeaway of the things I'm listening to your story and I'll check it relate any other because I'm not that caliber of a man my emotions wouldn't be as, I don't have your preparation I don't have your mind set on of your background is interesting that the point that still gives me fear as I hear the story then maybe no one's told you this before it's just a regular guy right is now he's dead right my fear level almost increase their the oddly so like you're executing a plan prior now he's dead the part that you said that you know we might really live that was a part where I'm just for me my fear went up like now or in this house clearly this events taking place probably someone knows it was going to happen if there's a clock ticking this then I'd be I'd be more I be afraid when I got on the helicopter in probably classified I don't know the truth but I've heard stories that they did have air support good American in the nff 15 lights up a Pakistani guy in an F-16 I think they will turn around you for sharing it with me I feel blessed that I'm with you I mean that I went through some hard things of your opinion of a few things and I are you you I did not know that you showed her his body that's fascinating to me when I heard the whole story of what happened there the part of me that went that sounds odd to me was the fact that he was dumped in the ocean afterwards and well into you or do you not know we gave him in Bagram Airfield to some of our army counterparts that brought out and put them put in a c in a scene the coordinates I wasn't there for the burial but I have heard from people that definitely happened to believe this but if you do a little research and realize he was a wahhabist they don't they don't do names on on on anything because you do not have a shrine to false Idols it's just a lot because he's not a lot to the messenger right and that's it so that I don't know good a lot of pictures and they're in a file cabinet in Langley and I really hope they get released is that right would be classified as a show I know people in Congress would seen the pictures got just curious about this a hard question because and I'm not going to debate you on anything like them Squares of your opinion because both of us are not one way or the other but I'm curious that this story that you here is that there was probably some enhanced interrogation stuff that may have led to the intelligence I noticed that is true and so how does that paint your feelings about those tactics going cuz the right now and then when this release is a little bit after but this is pretty much a prominent thing right now in the media right now with a lady head of the CIA and her taking a lot of flack for those techniques that probably produced the story you just told me how do you feel about that and it's it's administered by doctors it's not they have them in a cage in the same as whipping them their stress position sleep deprivation and waterboarding yeah that's that's sere school for us survival evasion resistance escape and the thing about waterboarding not being torture is that as soon as you decide it all ends and there's no no damage it just really really sucks you figure out why doesn't work and I'll admit that because it's so torturous power drills and blow torches and you're saying anything to make him stop that's it even guys like I I know the Doctor Who who interrogated Khalid Sheikh Mohammed The Mastermind of 9/11 and will Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and these leaders are not very charismatic people love them and their true believers looking for religious reasons and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Said to dr. Mitchell I don't know why you guys think you can just come in here and bring cookies and win hearts and Minds he explained to them that this is what we're like he cut off Daniel Pearl's head with these Blessed Hands is the way you said it and because he's going to happen and it's a very selfish thing to do. Why is it always speak what you said if you can convince someone to do it you get more of their Heaven is that right that's what everybody's like he's like week we believe this is actually believe you will you were there you probably weren't going to just be waterboarded help me by just waterboarded there's probably something coming for more severe Mega saying a gunfight save at least one bullet for yourself because you do not want you captured I mean just cutting your head off a nice way out there if they are sadistic when you squeeze him because there's all kinds of things that could happen you could have been blown up there you could have been captured it's just it's unbelievable so thank you so much now I want to continue the conversation a little bit because you have a chance this is team building this is leadership this is execution so there's all kinds of people in the business space I can tell you some sort of silly even to say right now some theories about how to build a team and how to execute and how to prep and then there's like real world business application and then there's like real world change the world team building business preparation and execution of the plan which is why you've been apart of and so talk a little bit for a second. In your in your case they can learn from you in other words you don't just watch this interview they can get access to you you can come and tell him the different venues just for second I want to make sure they not one is your book right that's a huge Place second place goes you can come speak yes and when he speaks just so you know I was a great speaker but like when you listen to him speak you're going to write pages of stuff it's not just like anecdotal stories like you just heard every stories related to a point of building a team so how can they how do they find you to speak number one and end and where they find you on social media as well I work with the leading authorities out of Washington DC so it's leading authorities ugly duck aurela florida.com Robert J O'Neill. Calm because if it's not a keynote presentation and I just show up for work shops or or nice dinner with Robert J O'Neill. Calm and then the social media is a funny one it's so far it's me it's me kuya m c h o o y a h and the reason the reason training just like shipment I love the word ship made me say it all the time is the Irish meals Irish and seven of us could mess with each other and sweet stuff out 7 followers know my name leaked Towing the line I woke up with like $15,000 more entertainment than anything but it's so good for me you know I've been in this space for a long time for meteor honestly tell you like I really learned things when someone speaks I really learned things because I believe like I go to a gym I want to betray my someone who always think it's funny when I go to a gym in the trainer there isn't in shape themselves or I want a business Mentor but they're not successful or wealthy themselves like show me your results I think we can safely say but you understand leadership team building an execution of a planet preparations Hasina Navy Seals how cool that we're not I want I want I want to do what he does not want to learn from him where his habits and what is different about being real for Marcus Luttrell yourself the seal who was in front of you any of the seals on this raid any of them anywhere cuz you meet you know those guys and then you know you went to high school with a really good too bright I got what's the difference the difference is I think the thought that every day I get to go to work with people who are better than me and I'm not going to undermine him I'm going to try to beat them but they knew that it was important as a team to be nice to each other be good to each other one of my bosses would say is he said please and thank you and you don't need to say that the military and he would always say nobody ever work for me they were with me and just added that's the mentality but it's almost like a credit for stuff but as long as you don't care who gets credit to see that kind of mentality in and they show up on time stay late and the years I was right to just their meticulous and meticulous take me to the Captain Phillips red team had never done to rescue his 1980s over 25 years has never been done and of the snipers that took those shots 3 days prior were in their beds in Virginia Beach and it doesn't need to be cited in for the most difficult shots and it might happen I mean it's a long weekend we've never done with my birthday when we left and I'll just take a day off and take care of my gear on Tuesday but we didn't do that because that's that's a shortcut so you hear the story and it is a movie but it wasn't a movie when it happens I like a real man is real family he had a real up bring his real insecurities real weaknesses and strengths real I mean even fears rights as a real person like you right and so he's been able to achieve extraordinary things in his life I want to take this moment now or you just a picture this for a second tell them the story and I love this about where you were and what you were doing cuz it's humid eyes that is ghetto see you and I think they think I'm just not like him and there are things about you that you feel better muscles mentally and physically you've built that are different than other people many of which you're not even aware of because he's also a father he's a husband who makes mistakes in his life he is he's all these different things tell him just picture this you guys of all probably seen the movie Captain Phillips right so he was a part of that. show picture this for a second. James Bond movie anything this stuff is sort of bizarre doesn't really work this way. And then just when you picture this tell him where you were and what you were doing when you got the call to go do it was my birthday is April 10th and it was Good Friday and I'm at my daughter's Easter tea party at her preschool in line in a buffet line with Sailors and Marines who have kids in the class and we're giving we're getting cookies and cupcakes for them and bring them tea and I was walking over to my daughter when I got the message that the Dems didn't say it like this we have going right now and we've been selling this technology that like I said we never done it from the time you get the message to the time wheels up and we're going we sold it we've been selling it for decades 4 hours we were wheels up in 3 hours and 59 minutes 103 guys there were guys out there that were mowing their lawn when they got the call a real guys can't afford the mortgage and her more than own lawn and then if they're off unreal don't know what's going to happen when you're carrying a little pink cupcake because I do think you're a real person like I think your regular guided right in and people that listen to see if he can come from where he came from this is crazy it's not overstating and I know you hate hearing this but altered world history world history. Cupcakes in his daughter's Elementary son on his birthday in your business what could you do in your body is a couple things I love I'm all about moving forward and what am I saying is I'm I'm as old as I've ever been but I'm as young as I'll ever be his Life Starts Now right now start in training when you wake up on Sunday and you do Navy Seals training until Friday it's miserable like your body starts to bleed by Wednesday cuz you're so saturated from the ocean right here and he gave me advice week but it's just it's great advice for life he said you were about to go to war for the first time and the enemies all your doubts all your fears and everyone you know back on the told you you were I'm good enough to do this keep your head. Keep moving forward no matter what never quit and be fine that's what I told him for a week and now that's life keep moving forward you're going to make me say we talked about failure that's how you learn dustoff look yourself in the mirror be honest why did I do that what do I learn I don't know but it's all good because it's like you know anyone is not screwed up you win or you learn unreal like people like you don't catch me sweets is very often so I want people to get access to you I want you I think it's an amazing time in history which hasn't existed before where I mean honestly there people driving in their car right now working out at the gym and you're getting access to a man has altered world history for freaking free and they can come here you speak for pennies on the dollar and being a room with you and meet you and have their life altered inspired and move there's never been a time in history where people who have achieved great things can say hey I'm just like you I'm a goofball I was at my daughter's Elementary School I make steaks I fall down you know I didn't even mean to be in the Navy Seals in the first acts like it's just unreal. To give you such hope and such an inspiration but I want to talk or say about some of the good work you do cuz I want people to know about this to these guys that are mowing their lawn and these men that are at their end women by the way who are at their daughter's Elementary School and can't pay the mortgage even sometimes active-duty struggling then leave the military and this man just so you know how to say is on your behalf left short of his 20 years and so there aren't I believe our health benefits to come your way there's nothing that comes your way which is sort of amazing to me and I just say this on your behalf that someone who's had 400 combat missions has been decorated with Valor as many times as you have changed the world on multiple missions we don't have a way to give you some of my health insurance and take care of you and so because that's the way it is and you don't need to comment on that I say that on your behalf crazy but because that is the way it is you've got involved and started something charitably that helps people when they transition out to find Corso talk a little bit about your foundation I started a foundation called your Grateful Nation so that's your Grateful Nation. Org and we transition the right now special operators because we're individualized was kind of a small group transition them to their next career so we find out where they want to live the industry they want to be a part of will make the introduction to that company and then we have a mentorship program 7 and 9 months and then their training where is now we're saying that these guys don't realize what to bring to the table even without a college degree but they're bringing the Stress Management problem solving team building the one where they use all the time as the Loyalty because you're getting that from people with a degree right now the phone calls are teaching that kind of stuff we have a guy that wanted to live in Phoenix and work for Fox Sports you doing that and Green Berets Rangers 50th Pilots Navy Seals and so now he's going to talk to the guys even the guys that retired they like what what am I qualified for this like you they would almost rather go back to the song that is solving problems oh my gosh we do that in the best email I get once twice a week is when they won tell me who they transition to wear and then from one of the spouses saying without your Grateful Nation we wouldn't have gotten second career hadn't realized that's too funny things they realize what they're worth then they also realize what their fair share in taxes on the rich pay all the taxes tonight show the amazing about thank you for doing that work in a thing about it is these are men who are women who were part of the greatest team and then became some of the greatest on that team is special operators likely to be the most elite of the elite like this gentleman across the Mesa let's finish what is a couple tips thank you so much for tonight so poor by the wait like honestly let's talk a little bit about team building things that you teach so there's people out there better have companies they're watching you right now they're going to come have you come speak to their company but give them a flavor for a second or some of the couple there's a million probably all of building a team like the one you were part of isn't just too trusting but part of me thinks man like you certainly end up with pretty damn good talent what time you get to Shields and stepper operators are some of the keys and building the team that people out there should know about you that when people feel like they are part of the solution to work harder effective communication because a lot of people disagree with this but I always thought that if people know what they're doing and why a lot of people don't want to say why because they they want to compartmentalize they should know why they're doing and when you're done saying what you're saying stop saying it the noise that comes with everything just get the message out there and we're good at one of my favorite quotes I don't know where to get credited never pass up the opportunity to shut up as for people that lead to the realizing a lot of the work gets done because your team is there like sometimes of the boss of the show up at work still gets done but the people don't show up. I'll be good to each other in the emotional thing like a try not to try to keep your emotions in check because your body always follows your mind and it's like they say the nasty text message you want to send someone pipe it up because going to make it feel better do not hit send for 24 hours and if you're still looking. plants not going to work the wave Murphy's Murphy shows up anything that you do can get you killed including nothing you having a bad moment you're milking into a bad day and the best of us have people is get over it just get fix it and get over this is so gold Hawaii and it's like you are well aware that come from well you end up with a guy the point man in front of you or at least getting ready to go on the mission say now tell me again like why are we doing this and I like it and you told him why and that visual of that Mom ocean list another point you just made helicopter ride over us we're guys are sleeping and there's getting other state that didn't Focus their counting like that also has application and then over me you're so right like a minute business I watch all times his book I read Called Death by meetings like when you're done saying something stop freaking saying it an echo execute write my last question don't be humble for a second okay okay to be real with me here what's different about men like you in other words if I want to be a person like you none of us including myself were victims I know what he owes us anything you can you can get it but you got to go get it and that was the key when guy who said stop being a victim in your position I assume your brothers all confirmed it with this victim thing different socioeconomic background different ethnicities some had great family think about it didn't matter who you were that's it 85% of Y cos 85% of black guys are not going to make skin color isn't one of us are going to make it as aren't going to make it depend on each other if we're going to matter what your religion your faith your political views are when you have a common purpose and a common mission in a common thing you want to accomplish years was a 85% of us are going to make it it's interesting how you come together it's interesting how you gel interesting how all your differences are differences or similarities don't care if you're gay or straight black or white Muslim or Christian we come together in a mission so that's one of the great lessons for the country to is it if we could unify in a common Mission a common dream a common goal Alta most of these things you see on the news every single night with a pitting us against each other would go away in about one of the Navy SEAL one of the best deals ever and then is transgender what up I just avoided contribute to the mission in like probably now which is actually now my favorite part of the interview because you can have one of the Thoroughbred studs of all the time I'm one of these the things you say a white successful businessman guy and we're both telling you that what we we don't care about those things we care about coming together making a dream happen making the mission have to make a different team in the mission show man I love that such a great lesson for you building a company for our leaders in politics for a people in the media when were chasing something in common when there's a common Mission the difference is go away and that's what I got to be chasing my favorite conversation little I really do but I have the right now but as of now and it's wonderful to hear that it's reciprocated so the brother like really thank you so much and God bless you and thank you for your service and thanks for sharing this.
