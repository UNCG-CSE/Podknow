Forgot to tell you this other thing we've got some new items in the merch store what you think of that did the WTF merch store there's a new WTF hoodie for the upcoming crisp fall days and then there's a new keychain and a new stainless coffee mug that you can get on your shirts go to podswag WTF for go to WTF podcast and quick on merch podswag distract ourselves with bullshit fights along the lines of social issues I know there's a large contingent of Comedians and the other part of it is also the great monoculture of free thinkers yeah where there's a lot of pushback against angry and defending their right to punch down because it feels good and it's fun to her people they are sadly on some level there is a reaction to a vulnerability discomfort accident pain tripping embarrassment and also there's part of the human psyche I think that seems to feel like that's part of winning excitement there and we're civilized people in this doesn't have to be the way but the point is my reaction I really am not keeping up on it but people ask me what do you think there's no way you can say whatever you want there's no constitutional amendment that says you can't say things have been characterized as he goes part there's no way you can say whatever you want and the pushback is going to be from a collective of people reacting to certain way on a Grassroots level 3 social networking platforms want a corporate-level there is no censorship on behalf of the government or the Constitution you can still say whatever the fuck you want all right now if your problems with corporations restricting your ability to stay because it goes against their bottom line don't fight that fight problems with how are you doing but the truth of the matter is I think you know what this is all based on First Amendment stuff for Lenny Bruce when he's intent was progressive lens intent in terms of using the language he used it sure was about language was about freeing the language you're looking at in America that was about to ask that major immigration your early 1900s and dealing with stereotypes and breaking them down using the word Plainfield and disarm some of that was a different thing then what's happening now can you use as a source what's happening now is there is a tremendous aggravation on behalf of certain type of people the majority in general that they can't pigeonhole or compartmentalize or a box through language and God knows they need to be pushed back on and he'll down cuz it's funny for the majority to laugh at the vulnerability of marginalized or different people I've been guilty arguably issue that I had a couple weeks ago could be seen as condescending and bullying but the point is you can say whatever the fuck you want you're just going to have to deal with the consequences do not get put in jail there's no there's no government agency routing for saying things about they can't say tranny or Fagen more but nobody's were the punch I think that if people would really to start punching up people with a Podium ER with a micro Comics if they start punching up they have to start with their own chin levels are from there they recover from the fucking self adapt to give themselves but it's always interesting to me the anger is like night like we can't criticize the government because they don't know how to make it funny but mostly it's about like you know why can't we make fun of people that are weird you can but my point is always been there will be consequences and you may end up only talking to people to talk the way you're talking and that's fine we moved past those anymore no one says colored anymore the cultures moved on and we're okay we can do it we can we can move passwords it hurt people and be more respectful and still be funny but if you need to say the word really needed making fun of the weirdos and then that's how it happens that's the fight you'll find your level you'll find your people and if you want to fight for the right to punch down then you can talk to those people at the hilarity of causing pain as far as SNL goes you know if you got a problem with that that's a corporate structure that's just of the market man the markets holding you down free thinkers look folks here's something they told us to do a 60-second ad for the element get to work starring Green Day Fall Out Boy The Sweater song dance dance your wife on your next summer and it's all across North America American Idiot I also have to mention it's going to be coming to a city near you and you can find tour dates ticketmaster.com basket case I would in the Sun and they're also bringing The Interrupters with them that's even more songs I let's see Thanks for the Memories Brain Stew my name is Jonas tickets go on sale tomorrow at ticketmaster.com don't wait till September Ends because you're more songs okay but I'd have to Google okay we good okay good so enjoy the life you have.

I'm going to get you sucker Joseph understand why people over but it was funny and I do like I walked his hair was using use around or call me it's a nice resource to have to borrow something by the waves in the neighborhood can you help me with this bit and cameras to see what is yes in New York like how how young like that was like my thing for us the industry for a long time cuz I was here when they disappeared into Show Business Middle School come to all of our graduations Midway through the graduation you just see this whole family walk in computer for 4 years and then I have to go for more info and then I went to Seton Hall to Rutgers state in college I really wanted to go to Rutgers and the basketball team was amazing and I just you're a fan of you like to play and not going to college across the street is like you know you want to get away from all these people ever have a life and then I went into the semester and was doing some of the same things I was doing High School teenage last turning 21 to BSN just should have been cutting School in high school right now 7 hours to get something for you to do my brother was here and so she was like you know he was like kind of starting his thing out and then I came in as little sister but this was me like coming out trying to get rid of okay so you coming out as gay out you're out I was just having a conversation with somebody but I said have a lesbian girlfriend I want to marry this girl and so I had great relationships with guys but I was the one to go you know what I'm just not ready when I am pregnant and it was just what is that my first real girlfriend I don't know but I remember I don't know that I would have thought that no matter what what's the problem wasn't that good for the Tomboy girl how do you say this cuz I remember Cindy that used to live across it all for my like how stuff works across the hall from me and I had to be like to say like 7 it was in third grade I had to check with Jamaican and so we used to leave in school everyday what is this the same direction always about women is something that is like easier life I would have to use your sexy body type of music is that an easy money on this is so like 10 more years and I'm tapping out Mark my work then what happens if you have a GoFundMe okay so so was building up and then you come out here come out the family sit with that this is my first audience I guess it really is with those guys like a family business are they all in the same operation in the building your house and work on their own stuff and in the beginning they were doing projects together present wind is music artist who draw a kitten and Sean is Marlins kid out here so I would remember basic so they were afraid to go as themselves what I would say hey do you need anything and So eventually became about where do I fit I started in their computers and exactly. And I wish I would have went to After Effects I probably would have stayed there after effects lotions and you're just in a dark room I start to get anxiety and get a super depressed any of these psychological New York I never had anxiety introvert, I have my moments you know what I was I was very hurt myself a lot and then and then when I got into that being in the editing room and trying to be a assistant editor be there that no more so she comes in and for five years she just was so mean to me she bothers my wife and kids show Damon date on come on to me in like into this room and immediately felt like I was wrong and I will go to the doctor and I was like I felt like I was dying because it's monster uncles in this business about it like what are you I'm trying to get her and then she became crazy to everyone else at the time and work outfits and look in the Press that's the person I would be friend in school just in case I just started to befriend her and then she wind up turn it on everybody in like towards the end of the year they were like I'm so sorry and I was like the nice out of me now it's always being me what you do when you finally realize what it was how long did it take for you to get a diagnosis of telling me like drinking a lot once if I like I will be so mad to spend 20 minutes friends exactly how many DUIs tell really I am, I'm very to just broke up with me not too long ago it was because I was sober for four and a half years I wasn't going to prescription for it tell me go to sleep you know and I was like I've never I never wanted crack after I crack working on it best best experience of my life being around checks without 10 days in Atlanta was a private jet but you was able to smoke cigarettes in it call Mark man in years, 7 funny thing but the first one somebody drunk driving his car and they flipped over and then I come back and so where were we and just how drunk I was fighting with his girlfriend and her face and I was driving in my fucking I'm taking you home and I took a U-turn I just smashed into a parked car. All these cops came but someone was robbing somebody's house and I can drive the car and now he's caps are you going to come out here are you dating women and everything's good woman I tried to Kingdom Hall for a little while witness the whole family just some of them that you're going to no dancing and singing 25 maybe I need to do that I just you know your life sometimes and then and then you don't have a part of my brain always search for religion and maybe I'm just tried Edison rest in a sense where he would just staying at their house very awkwardly snake passes but not like my body 13 14 15 I mean there was some creepy stuff wasn't the right fit religion you know maybe I need to go to speak tongues your folks were Jehovah's Witnesses cold out here what happens when you go try to speak tongues bro it's the weirdest where does s i like whatever you feel and that's what is the pre comedian Instagram just sitting here push me on the floor the best the best thing about that church was like going crazy I'm like I mean you're swimming on the floor how long it's because it's it's I mean I get the Translating everything you got understand me growing up call me back strokes and I want us to do it together a video of a starter going okay so the Pentecostal cuz I know people have this I don't have to ask my brother has what is it in your heart that you feel that you're lost a good life doesn't have meaning or what did you find an understanding and I believe in everything but I believe we can tighten I'll conscious to a level where we can actually find peace and heal all cells and I think one of us like I don't want to disappoint, especially my life to do all this stuff in your career still have to have my stuff together because obviously I have a purpose in The Voice right I can I get that I get that I just watched him part of a documentary about about this this organization to this Jesus organization that's behind you know that sort of serves people in power but the idea is your politics they're good people by the idea and just referring to the chosen thing I keep once you start doing something when you start speaking the truth that you're sharing unit to the communities at need to hear that stuff who are your marginalize are feel you know you know hate that you can immediately feel that you're providing a service you're giving voice to something to helping people feel less alone to make him puke before the dam feel stronger you know it's important and it be Jesus Jesus becomes a leader is chosen by God because why else would it be a leader evangelicals for like okay with Trump like God. You should be doing I mean I don't think anybody could talk to God that you can personally and I think you know it's because it's about the Vikings I forget what religion they take over this whole or something like that to my family, they had sorcery and also turn the person that they were able to use the AXA guide should I go do stuff until later in the show everything is about these costumes and then you also have somebody who speaks for you or to God and you got to go through Chanel amanecistes the Catholic said so deep well a Darkness there a mystical bullshit going on I like it I like it I can feel the vibe I get it I get it but there's still part of that magic can absolutely DUI but wasn't really your fault but you know you got a real one important stuff I have a great night and got me and then the third one I actually wanted the first time we went to jail get arrested initially and then they have you go to court and then probably have you go with me to give you 30 days or something right like you enjoyed the social scene to make apple jelly for me and it was very weird my hair off of e-cigarettes Atlanta was worse than it was the one that was trying to get in the shower with me and threatened a girly girls just offer me is only allowed one juice in and everything else the cops are the worst part of the deputies uncomfortable you like somebody who's having too much fun it's pretty sad if there's a social life you have that revolves around you have parties and bars and stuff but there's something so wrong about that whatever the gay scene is in a prison you're just a star right sometimes Atlanta was very open to a lot of stuff in jail and then she got out when you never heard from her again now she is not mess with my girl but I always nice to everybody everybody the girl from my last one she gave me a call to call to use the phone me up Atlanta the girl who give me a comes about if you find out your fucked-up the third one you know I think did you start comedy I started comedy in 2003 so I was I was drinking a lot and then the last time I got sober I met somebody with my spiritual and she started so I will get drunk and she wouldn't be mad at my Uncle told me to record my sessions and so I went in and I realize I was just complaining about something that you're blaming people for your life and it was kind of like a take-charge kind of thing call your wife top and she's just talking about nothing for an hour Revelation to have fingers cuz you were drunk I just started to work for you and then I'm waking up every day at 2 in the morning until 6 but then I got a full day I can't sleep I got stuff to do and I'm like showing up tired and stuff so she would like and I will go to work and wake up the next day. Became up like maybe do it but I like the idea very close to doing it not as much as I should but it can sit for like 2 minutes that's what people keep saying I shouldn't I learned that you can lay down lay down flat post cuz you got your chakras so you can fold it in certain places where you could set up like this so you count from 100 to 0 if you forget where you are you just either start over or start back from the number you remember you're kind of like aren't 39 and then you get you almost just start coming into this peaceful moment at like 10 and then you just kind of sit with yourself as you can. It's not about so 2003 comedy decide to do it other than your way right there was around me so much and I went home that night and I literally like set up all night and then I went back to the other invited me to the show but that became the first time I felt like I can speak without somebody telling me to shut up and stuff you know my own place where I can talk my shit for what that's a great thing, even expecting it was one of the best I've ever had in my life nobody and then and then to go against the grain and then people receive you still weird, the biggest right right right the crazy thing is I'm actually thinking about hitting Postmates deliver anything they can order from there so I've delivered Apple iPhones in just last year and I have those kind of jobs now I guess that units and changed everything like when I was coming up it was either Champs jobs or whatever I haven't had a fucking job since 1988 started making a copy of the world economy of being Your Own Boss for not big bucks are slaving for like right but you're still working on the show when he start doing comedy right you're still working on Damen show or not. So how did they respond when your family into something they're into it so I was able to know what my writing and stuff like that and so I would be in New York and call them and the Prague psychic hotline be so excited to just eat and then being a presidential can I stop and then she goes here and then I'll be on stage is amazing idea what it is like the level of nervousness is different when you have people around you that you like right or or your friends turn up in the front New York if I was in the back of my help me appreciate the support whatever you like from me because I was angry in Hindi. Wasn't I've never been it was a hard so I wasn't but when I see the guys that I respected in the room cuz you're not even stopped and struggle sometimes I don't think it's brilliant the my friend I'm coming from cuz we're part of it are in the room but your life is chaotic you're kicking around for your first first first day out in January on Netflix with the queen and n stand up shows that I felt like I was building towards this hour and I like storytelling and I don't want to hear somebody's jokes in Netflix what do you want from me but it's not even the same like I'm just a talking Outlets beginning idea how do you work them it's so annoying this Market was 2 minutes and a girl goes guys the reason why we make a big deal out of it is cuz we know I just saw to make people happy selamat Jalan one you still seem like you are in front of whatever lifestyle with swagger to wear a broad audience can kind of makes him uncomfortable how long does it take to get there probably eight years to go you know what I feel like I'm on to something and it was because I'm a member agent that can you know where the Miami and heat before make sure he's telling me I should probably stay away from straight men and I pretty much get like a small Standing Ovation and so I come out back and he's just like it's nothing you can say the audience decides if it's a gangster is the most conservative I've had these type of people approached me and say you're funny or you made me feel a different way of your honesty screw the networking all these people that just don't don't believe right right yeah cuz they're nervous for you and for whatever reason they can make anybody what do you mean there's no audience for this people will come and then you just try to hold on to your people like the black community in General on gay men yeah it's like you know we just don't know how many spots to headline and they got a picture of my hair straight Sprouts in the audience but you know it is not your night out is if I remember like almost passing out for the first time in Richmond where the light came on half of that audience was the worst starts on the back of your neck hurts the worst man that the sellers new room the sellers a hard room take minutes for some reason and I probably would have been in the audience looking at you like you got you sobered up for four and a half years I was at 4 you amazing recent face really quick. Really good word for what's swallowing but you know you can feel your body giving out what are you drinking a drink when I'm bored I need to I need to work I mean sometimes like you. I'll be in a frantic like you told me an idea I just need to get it out when I get excited and so a lot of times like if I'm just in the house I walked in a store that has alcoholic drink a lot of time but it it just start thinking about those too much and when you start to get back into that you know just on past mistakes are made video games and you don't make that appointment, Tiffany for like over 12 years at her out here before she broke I would say this for Tiffany was just so now what what is happening right now if you had line on house arrest, detour on the road house arrest Carmike if anything ever comes out then I need to put it out myself and so how's the rest even though I wasn't on house arrest it was kind of like things just like to know what happened the last two days I was actually trying to get the scram bracelet because I knew that would help me not be better for her to go out and I know you don't understand I have a problem I was like showing him my sponsor letter I wrote a letter what are you going to meet sound effects in my 20 Platinum I got 20 but I have that personality but yeah I go I went to the other day got my cake and straight it was a little hurt from my sponsor breaking up with me for the same stuff how you feeling today I'm good. for me cuz I'm not I'm not I'm not great with personal boundaries that that relationship starts a half and then sort of like the woman who got me sober used to say the first step is the only one you have to work perfectly so like you know how do you get to understand that you can't do it no matter what in in some of that has to do with the repetition of the shit right so I used to talk everyday or go to a meeting every day I used to get I was that guy in meetings rub you like you lost eventually The Habit starts to happen you really start to realize that you're wondering away from destroying your life in any number of ways so in order to get that thing that powerless thing in their takes repetition you got to brainwash Yourself by doing that shit even if it's stink there you go you just had a meeting could you sign my card for me please I got all the time in this DUI program right now teaching us program shows up like the last 15 minutes to know that you go to certain places in Waukesha I always get so you just know I love the directions absolutely my next life to take you ten lifetimes to get sober and I've been in and out I definitely understand that go on the road I used to it so funny we go on the road and you look up you go looking for meeting on the road and you always end up at the weirdest wrong as meetings one time I was on the road and I found a meeting that was near me another guy program parts of town and stuff it gives you the incentive to go check it out I go down there and I find a meeting and I find stuff that is completely like it feels like it's against everything for me stories about South Carolina here looking like I've been to those meetings that you turn around and messing with me and I was like this is why are you in a relationship or really know that works. I just got to wait it out because I'm not already in the relationship it might be a little scary but I'm going to be gone for a while so I'm just a little scared too well I think I think it's great You're great and I'm glad you're alive and now you know you have me before I get to Tiffany's level if I get you after that the stories are in and I don't want to be projected Badness I'll be fine and stuff are they they're excited about the day all of it you know my uncle told me he said you represented as you represented as well and he's just like I'm proud of you and I even the most in the stand part of the family in good luck with everything what day is there's some at an interesting point of view interesting family Shante is part of the Netflix comedy special Tiffany haddish presents don't miss the righteous gemstones Sunday nights on HBO from the team behind Eastbound and Down and vice-principals comes the story of Enterprise any McBride as bad boy preacher Jesse gemstone John Goodman as the family patriarch as the younger gemstone siblings are Sundaes at 10 p.m. only on HBO and now I got my phase shifter out I got my EarthQuaker Grand Orbiter out yeah in the Stratocaster call Meryl lives
