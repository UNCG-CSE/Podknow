hey qween season right now you know it's like throw things off I get ityou know I don't feel like that was like it was rock salt and not Lowery's but you know sometimes you know something is going good I am running like a 40th birthday party birthday party which coincidentally has the same day as yoursbig and didn't go well and it just was a really good I'm going to say it so we are testing for food and one of the vendors we had like the temple was on the salty or side like by salty aside I mean like a 7 out of 10 and it just didn't know if she didn't realize it was not really well we'll see you then I thought that's what tastings how to saywanted to say just are people in my family that have diabetes so we can talk about the sugar Michael. The song watching TV instead of talking it was like what's happening did you go is this a friend or did you go to the lake one to the restaurant for tasting she might not have even realize that her energy turned off so she might not have because she's really friendly and amazing in the beginning but I can I get it I don't know if she's a new business but I know some people are artists and I'm sensitive about my ish when you're in the service industry the customers should be right so because it is what it is I don't you know it's why I brought a friend with me who was I was just watching me like that dance like that that she was clearly upset and I wondered if I was like I just feel really bad as she seemed to be upset she likes you could not have said it lighter you literally could not have said it if this is your 40th birthday you need the food to be on point ocp back very well and you know but she said it was clear that she shut down my feedback are you going to come with salty food still or two if I give you feedback on the day of my party are you going to make it uncomfortable you know because you know some people don't mind I said what I said but that's not me and I'm like I don't want to have to battle these emotions unlike my big over his birthday you know so yeah it was a good lesson for like what's a good iPhone or a lesson in this and never made a good lesson was that sometimes you get feedback that feels uncomfortable and you might subconsciously shut down she probably didn't think like I said she wasn't nasty so I likely if I would have to share this feedback because I didn't so she probably didn't think that she had created a very uncomfortable environment but it taught me to like this might happen when someone gives you a couple of feedback and you might subconsciously shut down at to be mindful of creating energy in space where people can tell you when something is not right so yeah it was just really like what it was like dead silent drop the pin I was like so I guess we should leave or you definitely using her as a caterer now okay I wonder if you like and look at me like are you kidding me I always need my like my you know my friend who is not afraid of like like you know confrontation to be like no Tiffany so you going to use her so that way I mean I've made decisions like that rhyme like this is an important day and because I didn't want the person to be upset with them even though I didn't like the service or the product I've used it anyway and I'm like Tiffany like so like some people pleasing just takes take it to the next level so smart to bring people who have the other side I mean it's not like you need to change I'm sure your people pleasing nature is why you're so successful in other ways so sound like you need to learn how to be a jerk you just bring the drugs with you you know what I said what I said I wasn't even standing it cuz I knew I wasn't rude but I'm like I hate this expensive like I don't know, tell me why you had to beat you up like what happened and so I just wish that something that like I'm really trying to work on to be like us more assertive in this is what I like this is what I said I'm not saying in a rude way but I am about it because honestly I'm not alive I went by myself yeah that's a good resolution for your 40th your fourth decade when your feelings in your opinion that don't don't apologize for them that ass business lady like you know it's so crazy cuz you know that is what I've learned about myself is that when it comes to me I'm like but let it be like someone on the team family friend whatever like it's a different Tiffany so I think the reason why it's like it's because when I'm doing things for my audience like these are my dream catchers like I'm very protective over them and their journey and so nothing stands in the way of that so what a bank or brand of whoever I feel like it is doing something that is not helpful and purposely harmful but a different Tiffany comes out so I think that's what it is is that I've learned that if I'm working in service of other then I'll hit all bets are off but when it comes to me personally that's why I have a hard time and that's why I honestly I remember like a few episodes yes by it's all like I am very conscious now because I've hired a bully friend if she was brilliant but she was indeed a bully friend and I realize now that I'm really really careful cuz I'm looking for a new admin and I interviewed a few women and one of them gave me bully friend Vibe I said absolutely not. Meanwhile she was brilliant but I could tell she was great as she would have been awesome but I also knew that there was that little like inkling of the bully friend and she's going to make like her personality is going to make you feel uncomfortable be afraid to ask her things I can't have that in my admin but I chose someone instead that I knew that you know our personalities where she was like really warm and welcoming and that even when I was like deferential that she didn't take advantage of that and so I've learned it by not surrounding myself with people they're going to put me in a position to feel bullied so yeah so that's why I'm done well it's because I'm a beast that make sense I make sense I get it but still something to work on because I'm like so teach me your ways. That's the reason my husband isn't one like Mandy put down the gloves like it's not the moment we were always this is a good example he went to see hustlers this weekend and it was pretty good it was pretty I love JLo like I just feel like she's so underrated I want her to get all she never wanted anything for Selena which I think is a damn crime Grammys I'm just like it's it's appalling that we have not you know giving her her due anyways I'm happy that she's getting great reviews but we we saw it and it was like a late Sunday night showings who were just like yapping to the entire movie that got up and were talking to each other and I mean I really desperately wanted to say something to them like snarky or like you know get them to be quiet but then I thought and I looked and Enrique he knew what I was going to do he's like not today we don't want to get in a fight these girls and they would fight you let it go and I let it go a younger man he may not have let it go cuz I like the Pope the Beast until but I find that people like I feel like people respect that like you know that it's crazy because when you danced around it I feel like people like I found that when I my most passive is when it brings out the aggression and others more so you know it's just a balance in Newark is like my first year and I was such a punk in the parents used to treat me like I know one day one day I was sick of it and I told the biggest baddest Tarrant I never forget basheer I was like it was like 10 and I think we didn't take kids past like 9:30 and she was always late but you know she lives across the street and I was like it was raining here by 9:30 or so see you tomorrow click clothes store in Savage that's how you're going to start my car is going to be torched as you came at like 9:20 or early I want to do I look at her she said Mississippi I did say I know what the heck I was trying to get there if I don't know why we had to do the Kiki and to show me pictures of Zendaya who is now like 16 which makes me feel extra holes on my are you kidding me standing up for myself in like you know that often times it generates respect rather than whatever fearful thing I'm I'm waiting on but but yeah well I guess I'll be fighting after school today all right y'all so it is time for when you know what it was funny cuz I took a picture with Usher Play Gone to Atlanta to do his own thing called new new journey and I went to go like teacher session by conference for the young people in his nonprofit so so I went and took a picture with him but it was so weird and someone in the comments and I just saw this like last night and it had me rolling some of them, said did you tell him that you always mess up his confession song for the question song well this is oticin these are our question don't have me rollin' cuz I do keep messing up the confession song anyway it's time for questions and I am excited cuz you guys always amazing questions questions well thank you I sure will you can go to Brent Edition podcast. Com hit ask us anything descendants question hit us up on Instagram at Brennan's ocean podcast you can hit us up in our DM there please be detailed that brief or you can email us directly at Brandon Mission podcast at gmail.com that we do we have a bunch of too many questions today so I'm going to save some for next week but I let some questions a lot of credit related questions to let take the phone from email inbox this week from us nurse should know who said I'd use a bunch of what I've learned through this podcast to be successful during my home buying process my question is what's a good resource to find a credit card for new homeowners we have a couple things that we need to purchase like our fridge blind excetera I want to use a rewards credit card so I can read some benefits help a sister out I think you had a really good credit card that you guys used right yeah right so of course we can recommend some credit cards but read the fine print read the terms and conditions on the card make sure the right card for you personally when we were doing our renovation we decided to sign up with the Citi double cash card because it was basically the max cash back you can get on like any purchase and there aren't that many cards that have a flat cash back rate on anything that are higher than like 1% so 2% was the best we could do and the way the Citi double cash works is that it gives you 1% cash back when you make the purchase and it gives you another 1% when you pay it off so you only get the full 2% if you're paying off the card info we also took advantage of a 0% intro APR offer I forget the name of the credit card with a Chase card and it was 0% for 12 months or something like that and we use that for some larger purchases and we just paid it up pay that off this summer which felt Gray and I allowed us to have no interest for you no 12 months that the risk with those types of cards is that often they have deferred interest causes which means if we had left even like $1 on that credit card after that promo. Ended they could have been like oh you were charged interest this entire year and we're going to slap it on we're going to stop it onto your card right now so I was dead I was adamant that we were not going to you know what that happened so that was our strategy did you guys use any Vince me that we need to get a Home Depot card and I was like no we don't need that much. I mean like $2,000 Home Depot during the renovation are tribal card as like as I go to credit card and we let's just say my we have so many trips pending friend and I've got a mean I could go to Zimbabwe and stay like in the presidential suite at the president's house for this many points if we have to think about it now because I use my travel card for marketing I really didn't need the additional travel points and I really wish I would have got you cuz you told me about that card and the beginning and honestly I wish I would have gone and gotten it because I would have much rather than the cash back an additional we have so many travel points now that like I'm just like my whole family tribal cards don't give you the same rate for like a purchase at a department store or like on furniture as they would on travel expenses like the the most lucrative travel cards really only give you High cash back rate if you're paying for travel purchases so that's what that's why we ended up getting a Citi card because we knew we were only going to get 1% back if we used our our travel card Home Depot carpet looked at I remember it having any like cash back benefits I think it's more that it offers it offers different like financing options like 0% or whatever depending up I don't know they do like you guys to check but I don't know that they have like a cash back card that'd be nice though Cassius Queen and see if there's any. I'll put a link to the magnifymoney credit card tool there's new credit cards I can't even keep up anymore they're all the time and one of the other reasons I love the Citi double cash card is not he doesn't even exist anymore they got rid of this program where they were doing when you call it now I forget baby baby brain o a program basically we're if we made a purchase with art Citi double cash card and the price dropped after we made the purchase they would actually go back and refund. I remember they got rid of that program so lucrative and they're starting to scale back their programs to make them while they're very expensive for the company's to keep up so some of them have been stealing them back so they're not as lucrative as it used to be sadly but we took hella advantage of that Park while I was there thank you Chanel the book with the home-buying parentis make sure if you take out credit have a plan to pay it back you do not want to start your homeowner Journey with a ton of credit card debt and be house poor and it's just going to be sad so take your time if you don't have the money to pay it off just like take your time you don't need a fancy blinds for the fancy couch right now take your time getting that stuff over the next few months if you can okay who's next okay so we got a question from Instagram user whose name is tee tee times I need some advice I have a rental property that's increase in value I paid $98,000 and the exact same type of house in my neighborhood just sold for $139,000 so I'm wondering should I sell my rental property one of my tenants move out in a few months I'm planning to put in new carpet and laminate flooring as well as build a deck on the back of the house and I said oh and so our house is 90002 paid $98,000 she still owes 91 that wasn't on the mortgage if your laundry so much was she asking she after renovating a property if she should sell it and that she wants to do a couple of upgrades new carpet laminate flooring and build a deck and then she wants to try and sell it because she's seen this other house that she thinks is comprable that's sold for like $40,000 more than what she paid for her house you don't I I thought that you did and I was like nah bro meaning that stated that cost you $10,000 just like for Maxie right and you think like oh so now that's going to make my house worth $10,000 more like maybe it'll make your house be worth $5,000 more that's what I don't get that upgrade you don't what you put out for the upgrade very rarely if at all do you ever get that exact number back like they like on a good look like on a good trade its 60% back like like men and I both got like a seized in our house and AC like I'm Central AC or like a split system you dead it's pretty good and you get like 60 to 65% back but that's not a hundred percent so if you know of cuz that's like what you're looking at if you're putting in a split system for a loan for a season your home you looking any way they could be 20-30 $67,000 or more not going to get $30,000 back maybe you'll get twenty so just be mindful that if that house is comprable to your house as it stands and you're wanting to sell I would not make I would not it except for like small things like paints and you know things like that yeah but I wouldn't make these big changes because you're not going to get that money back unless you're saying that that that the other house has the deck and all these other things and that's what you're wanting to add but yeah I mean renovating or or moderate renovation do not going to see that money back and you might just get your money back with the house as it stands now and if if if your neighborhood is on the way up meaning like you know you're watching month to month and you saw don't know how long have the house and you might want to wait like it is your is your tenant paying the mortgage if so it's not necessarily cost you anything and is a little bit of tax break not as much as I used to be but there's a little bit of a tax break so I don't know if it's making me money and in the neighborhood is on its way up because five years now maybe you can get you know 200 or to 225 for that house you had answered a weighted if she needs the money or if she's looking to flip take this take the the money she earned to this house and flip it into another rental property Market Sabor example you do the math of what percentage has the house grown in value and what and that you're so let's just say it's grown I don't know 15% in one year I mean that's better than the women crazy I'mma tell you like in Newark that's exactly what's happening because so Newark is for those of you who like don't live in this area of the of the country Newark is super close to New York which is a really expensive place to live in people want to live next to New York because of jobs and so what happened is Midtown which is basically like stuck by The Hub of New York is super expensive and they started which is like and so Harlem is Brownstones at these older Brown folks old they were buying them up for panties and now they're whereby $2000000 / 10,000 and now there were too many which is just hurting when you find out their homes in in in that trade that was unfair and then knowing you still want to live in Brooklyn baby Brooklyn has a section called Bed Stuy to be Bed-Stuy do or die and you're likely to die and now Betts. Is that they gave it another name is fancy and expensive and people can't afford Brooklyn as well as a result of New York spreading out now they're looking over the water to Newark who before Oakland think I'm trying to take with some other places like you know like so kind of connotation of because people can't afford Manhattan they can afford Harlem anymore they can't afford Brooklyn they've already moved to Jersey City which is even the closest kind of like City to New Jersey to New York now they've looked at Newark and someone when Superman and I were looking 2 years ago Mandy literally a house be on the market for a 200,000 and it would go for 250 it was one three family house that was fairly priced at at 280 and we lost it to someone who did 327 get like it'll hide your $50 in the gas mileage for the house so there are sections of the country where because of just one section of the country because of like just like it's just so expensive to live here that people are willing to move further and further away from the desired place which is New York City that like I was in constant like jumping up like jumping beans honestly so if you live with somebody like that but if you listen place where she's creeping up and you just like I don't want to deal with tenants anymore I'm over it I just want my money well then get your money and invested someplace else yeah I agree and I'll put a link we actually use that there's like a website remodeling but they put out Ali-A list of like the ROI the return on investment of certain how Home Improvement projects and I think one of the most like lucrative ones you can do is replacing a garage door last time I read like random stuff like that yeah so I'll post a link in there in and you know especially if if you're selling to people who might want to read about themselves or not going to want to pay for a lot of upgrades like they're going to want the bare minimum so they can write it out as well so interesting and congrats on having a rental property at school goals goals goals goals here's another one from the gram I don't know how to pronounce this was just go with Breezy hoe Instagram user Breeze has hello I've got $11,500 in credit card debt and I just received $5,000 from the settlement should I use it to pay off some credit card debt to get my utilization below 30% or should I use it or should I use a 0% transfer a balance transfer credit card to pay them off thank you the $5,000 would knock out a little less than half of that $11,000 so she wouldn't quite get to 30% utilisation idea is this a part where you ask her if she has emergency savings Hold Up Wait A Minute back up do you have not so I would be hesitant to put all this money toward debt and credit that it could be a sign that you have been turning the credit every once in awhile when you run short on cash and it's kind of become an emergency funds so text right I mean like putting that $5,000 in the bank so you create emergency fund could be one step and then from there if your if your credit is good you don't mention with your credit score is below States above 68670 that's usually about what it takes to qualify for the best 0% interest balance transfer cards let's say you can qualify for one of those and you can transfer your balance is on to those car at that card and pay them off loli overtime that could be a great that could be a smart strategy cuz I know you didn't fully pay off a credit card can you have money in the bank in case another unexpected you know expense tops Backpacker know how much of the of what your limit is for that with the balance we have that eleven thousand so if you are over 30 which well you say basically you are over 30% then my concern is that maybe your credit score is going to be reflect about that because you know your amount sold is 30% of your credit score so it's a significant part of your credit score is being negatively affected because you have a balance over 30% of that credit card language so that was my only concern that would she qualify for a balance transfer this is offset by that emergency savings and you got to be right back in debt because you're an adult and things happen unexpectedly two adults and if you don't have the cash to handle what happens unexpectedly animal that is 0% interest promotion. Even for a balance transfer just be aware that it may have a deferred-interest clause which means if you don't pay it off 100% before that 12 months are 18 month. Over they could just slap you with all the interest all over again so I have a plan you know be realistic can you actually make enough payments throughout the year to pay it off before the prom. Ends and another option besides balance transfers if you don't feel confident what if you can't get approved for a balance transfer to if you don't think you'll be confident that you can pay you know that much money over the course of how many months to to pay it off in full before the promotion. And you could also look at consolidating your credit card debt with a personal loan especially if you can get up how to lower APR than what your credit cards may offer you with a personal loan you have a fixed monthly payment a fixed term there's no risk of having deferred-interest get you know getting hit with that if you don't pay it off because they create a plan for you to pay it off in a certain amount of time so that's another another option for you and hopefully that was helpful thank you very much for your question is Breezy my bad now it's time to family are you going to boost their break Mandy club and you're showing off thing in the words and it's the remix and you like don't know the remix yet cuz I was ready to like break it this week because some it's been driving me a little nutso I'm going to take a break from engaging with the rumor mill at the office whether it can be about anything you know about someone's personal business or about someone's professional business but I'm just at a point where I just feel like there's people of certain people in offices that really get off on like gossiping and spreading rumors or not deceiving spreading rumors but just like engaging and rumors or trying to start rumors and so much lost like wasted energy because it can cause people to stress out about things that don't even that are I'm going to happen or it can cause people to feel bad about things that may not even be true and I feel like as adults we should just as much as you can avoid through the mail and honestly as a manager former Mills drive me nuts because I feel like they undermine sometimes like you as a manager you don't always want to tell you don't you can't always tell people exactly what's going on because you don't want to get people at night and I purposefully do this I'll withhold information if I'm worried that there's not enough information and it can just cause more uncertainty because that would just like former Mills live on uncertainty they thrive on like the not having the full information so I like purposefully weight if I know there's like people who gossip on the team because I don't want to give them any fuel to Flame fires of you no uncertainty or questioning you know what the the bigger mission is so that's my break I don't know if I'll ever cure office gossip probably not but it's kind of just drives me nuts Edition have you seen it what you got to buy some penis but it's hilarious and what's 7 / turned on and he came on and what is his closing messages was basically he literally said mind your business yeah yeah it's very easy to get caught up in the social media where all do you know like the way we live in social media sometimes people take that offline especially as if they have access to that a friend of a friend was like supposed to her husband like she used to and like I hope everything's okay. Hope everything's okay even realize I had not posted I guess the truth is I don't know my business and now I have a team that largely manages they are so of course my husband but I just thought that was funny that like you know it was funny because I posted for our second anniversary I posted like you know just a quick second anniversary love you babe and then someone who listens to Brown ambition she wrote like a girl you have to post this for her what's your business you mind someone else's business cuz you're taking away energy and time and effort from some things that you can use to grow your own self your part what about you booster brake honestly this is random but I'm going to break I don't know what's going on so I was supposed to go what do they call a a brand and no I'm Financial Wellness brand ambassador for which I love because so many Financial companies don't get that Financial Wellness should be the should be the like the goal not having a certain amount of money as a potential is really starting to come around and understand that summer so they haven't told they have this whole push toward Financial wellness and how can we help you be on just what time it in insurance for like how can you be okay as a person and how can you use your finances to help support how you want to show up in this world I love being a brand ambassador for potential but anyway before the five things to do to prepare before the new year financially prepare for the new year so I was excited I cannot connect and I was like what I'm trying everything so now I'm Sweating Bullets you know and I tried everything and it wouldn't work and I mean I got on the phone with every Tech person I could buy we went to every single scenario and it still doesn't work so my brown break is like trying to think I don't know I don't know if I'm supposed to go live tonight I'm going to just do it for my phone which is not ideal because he wants to hold your phone as I'm like a handy person until I know but yeah I just sometimes it's like being it but if anyone is super tacky send me your Instagram it'll be too late tomorrow Facebook and yeah all the time but I would say at least every month or so so I don't know randomly why I can't tell if someone's like oh my God it's because I'm using Google Chrome clear the history in the cookies and I did it all and I still am still not working so it's just frustrating so that's my brown break because it's stopping me from being great week so if anybody has any suggestions about what we can do to get my computer camera because like my camera and I do not know why yeah so just you know I love it because it's breaking my spirit it is hoped Tiffany I'll forward your responses brand Edition podcast at gmail.com well that was my kids shall those questions were really great I love and you guys act like you know when you guys always ask this question
