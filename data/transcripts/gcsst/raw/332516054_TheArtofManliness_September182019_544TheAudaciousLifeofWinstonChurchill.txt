Of course in the middle mean where the danger was intended to be wherever it was the most important thing was happening a certain things a junkie you want you to make important it was getting all mixed up the world's best paid for the right to fight but to report on it that's why he stood me ready the way in which he was able to do both of the fence he was a when is train was ambushed by come on days he of course the men that are only Amber strain and I managed to get deposited back freeway in the nines and say that he was a soldier what's an interesting thing was even men fairly unusual and today 30 online Margarita Claymore that criticism holds true or has any water on the runway 2008 cavalry charge of the British Empire with the with their dead and wounded stray thousands upon thousands of them for they so he can you raise the colors of wardens and need a place that he found it and it wasn't about Eastern rescue that he was a as soon as some attention seeking junkie he was somebody who really appreciated that in war if you're going to write about it you need to be up close and personal use 25 he fought in various campaigns around the world became of the highest paid War correspondence in the world 25 second make you feel really bad about yourself cuz I when I was twenty-five think I was in law school and how was it yeah absolutely I mean this guy 25 days the years those the years that you can and really get down to why it's taking risks and never moved blame me for mistakes and two wonderful series of phrases to another think you will know about Churchill besides his political career that he was actually one of the most notable historians of the 20th century like he was a prolific writer where did he learn his craft was he formally educated in history he wasn't text me he went to take that be on school taking his living God by his Tennessee walkers from them because his father didn't leave him money and he had to take care of his brother and his mother he is always interested in driving emotional. His life was his sense of history and say how do you think is appreciation for history shaped his outlook on his life we didn't make him like this with a staunch reactionary traditionalist or was it something else that happened what's the reaction a traditionalist until they throw in his career he cross the George what it did do was to allow him to see there is Frets the Griffin in there a rule historical context and that was why he was one of the reasons why he was one of the only people that need the first Us in British politics to warn against the threat ization of Europe as something that was in the lungs Continuum of British history getting back to the Spanish Armada Louis XIV the Napoleon and so on and so this was an essential prerequisite ready for his being able to place they don't eat red in the correct historical contacts private throughout the book is that his is love of history in the past allowed to be very forward thinking the same time that's right he was the first person in the west of any notes to warn against the Soviets tracks the danger of the Ooze based on an S7 to Eastern Europe need to know if you're up and about speech to be made in Fulton Missouri and bought 1946 was and then by Congress and Parliament actually showed tremendous full-size his appreciation for history his knowledge is thorough knowledge of of British history that came to be very helpful during World War I fall back on that as he was trying to mobilize and keep the British people together during the all the bombings in that's for the threat of Nazism coming to them he would talk about the Spanish Armada to read about Drake and about Admiral Nelson in the dangers to bring them back in the Napoleonic Wars in history has a way of basically telling the British people that you've been here before their contractual invasion in the past this is how we dealt with it this is what we do and we came through and we will win and so he used his dream house lizard where you folks Spring Maryland fighting demonetization in the bathroom experience for better health and hygiene Su Amigo is a bidet toilet seat install yourself there's no plumber needed and once you install it you got this great experience you can control the water temperature that you use the position of that water pressure with movement at his hand remote control got a heated seat and a deodorizer to the Nate Solder with a carbon filter and fan dryer off when you're done once you install it you can do yourself like I said I did mine less than 20 minutes you're going to use on average about 75% less toilet paper in your house when you get told me go install my kids love it they call the robot toilet because it is pretty much like a robot go to my amigo.com manliness to get 20% off your order that's myomigo that's Omegle with an O as a know how to ever live without this so for better health and hygiene stop wiping and start washing would be glad you switch my amigo.com manliness do you 20% off the toilet seat that's changing lives one wash at a time could check it out also by the strenuous life history slaves an online platform that we created until he put into action all the things we've been writing about in the artist manager for the past eleven years now and talking about on the podcast we've done that a few ways first we create a series of fifty different badges based on 50 different skills piercings like public speaking social skills personal finance how to be a better husband better father you guys have a hard skills like first aid Wilderness survival self Defence emergency prep we got that you also will send you a weekly challenge they'll put you outside of your comfort zone in some way we also hold you accountable with a daily Fitness can a good deed check in to get you thinking outside of yourself as opportunities for you to meet up with other TSL members in your area to do this stuff together we just had enrollment in September filled it up in less than 24 hours next enrollments going to be in January so you want to kick off the year right check out the strenuous life.

However he was a politician you learn from his mistakes and to pick up the one that you mentioned during the second world war so even though constitutionally he could Minister of Defense actually never once and that was a great message that he learned from a catastrophe Churchill was one of the few people who saw the dangers of Nazism when it started coming to rise in his his appreciation for history is knowledge of History allowed him to what did you take any personal experience where he given almost unshakable belief that Hitler had an ambition to conquer Europe size in historical terms of Representatives constituency user Lannister support for area of a lot of the other people sitting on the benches with him visiting Charleston background and Brittany how do you say that was another if the ways that is to the personal beliefs and back that allowed him to be the first major British politician to warn against what was happening a few leaders who actually read Hitler's mine comp and try to tell people okay look he says right here in the book what he plans on doing that thing it doesn't you mentioned to was when he was working in India he saw like jihadis like you saw jihadist extremist the live radio of the kind of cells are made with came down to Atlantic fundamentalists and so you have these the sense that he had spacing in India and Africa came up as he has a side and hid from the Nazis something you didn't do you weren't supposed to be publicly ambitious right but it didn't seem to faze him all that much what was it about Churchill's character or a past experience in life that allowed in just to be so stoic in the face of so much criticism thrown at him some stat ready which is tremendously but the entitlements in public life today but he was tremendously intitle he was the son that was the grandson of a Duke even born in a promise of the very Apex of Victorian society and which state has happened to that point in the history of the world decade of the Wilderness years in 1930s when he was a child sit down in the House of Commons the crying and then he never had a seat taken away from him by the conservatives he was attacked in the Press come see how does a thick skin probably down to his extremely and glands backgrounds that allows him not to care what other people when he was seven and he looks like like an aristocrat even at 7 years old how do you say he said his old self he wasn't worried about his place he just he knew what his place was and he just just kept on his body didn't have any business that I was able to attend 4 years of everything his papers in his letters and I know that he has friends Nexus 7 rates of his place and friends came from from very humble background some of them and he treated them sleep mix iced tea the same as that the people who were born to the purple was his wife's Clementine what role did his wife play in his career throughout his life to Rainbow and actually he couldn't take the school advice very well from the most people but he would take it from 17 he has this since she was only interested in his best interests unlike some other politicians another advises and then and say that game for a special in from all that advice was usually very good in fact Somebody to Love this life and the faithful to her and they had a very happy marriage but he asked about scrap strategy your advice on the speaking of Churchill's family life he did have four children how what was his relationship like with them like was it did he replicate the what happened with him and his father was a detritus something different he did to expand replicates what happened with his father he had a terrible relationship with his son Randolph school. He was a heavy drinker and was not have none of the job of a stall that some of these bring it in sex with father but they had endless rounds he looks very soon they go together on a vacation pretty much stay with BF that was a tragedy for the base of the parents and then there were two other excuse to say what it was not a it's not uniformly I think it's the other daughter married to James live to a happy old age and it's very difficult to be easy creamy like Theodore Roosevelt who is very much like Winston Churchill as I was reading this that very similar lice but his family life is kids had a lot of problems as well play it again and again in the in history that say much is expected on this the child come live up to that spend itself in them in something with self destruct. The whole lemon with Princess pans out Roosevelt was her the Scion of New York but they both have the same temperament of wanted to be in the scene the action want to be where everything's at both the literary man as well both became great leaders of their country at least you ever cross paths when he said he thought you were like I think I might have been the reason I think they said they were very likely that they trashed other than that so the popular image of Churchill as a sort of scowling no-nonsense man wearing a bowler chomping on the cigar but the Churchill that emerges in your book is very emotional he's funny he is full of life and he's also an imaginative sometimes had premonitions about things and allowed intuition to guide his decisions so he seemed to really feel things deeply how do you think Churchill sentimentalism in romantic Outlook help him as a leader it was actually a free back from it to an earlier romantic Regency figure out where people did wear their home from that sleeps they didn't mind sharing animations in Publix so in recent years there's been a lot of criticism slob. Churchill like freezing he was a racist that he tried to commit genocide in India during World War II that he was The Mastermind behind the Dresden bombings are there any based on this information you've gotten are there isn't much validity to these criticisms School while Charles Darwin was still alive and people did believe that they were High Rockies are braces in those days now ever invaded scene we might think that today at the time it was considered an actual scientific facts and then what he took from that was actually the exact opposite of what they took from it which was the belief 50 Cent to put some responsibility and duty to the people when they just peoples of the empire in some way in couraging a genocide of the time of the Bengal famine is being absolutely incorrect also do in fact when you look up his lessons to President Roosevelt asking for 4 weeks and Grains be sent to India doing that if he was a genocide romaniac he did everything that was supposed to save the Bingo leader starting Bingo theirs but of course no more places that buys grain in the circumstances such as Burning Man Thailand and banana I'm the Japanese Occupation it was next to impossible to get rain in Legacies he's a perfectly reasonable response is I think if I give insulin some deep down in my book the fact is the Fairway noodle points from east to west went through dressed and then gets them the Russians begged us to have to destroy me to get the best sleep pill speaker down the Knights of the 13th of February 1945 and Jesus as an ox is claimed which unfortunately some excuse to invite David Irving who say propound reason for the last thousand people died after his death didn't provide proper air rate for school shootings in the city not thinking it was ever going to be at so Churchill became a great leader during World War II do you think he was born a great leader did he fashioned himself into one he went out very deliberately as a young man to become a great man and then and you see this again and again in the early chapters I think of my book but he was working with that snake but it was very much a destiny that he was going to Fashion himself could take today from the life of Churchill there's someone happy page he is full site which we've got into his personal courage and physical and mow his ability to learn lessons is she resilience coming back from disaster after disaster how do you say instead Lakeland dependent bookshops ramazan but there are the reviews are on my website www.
