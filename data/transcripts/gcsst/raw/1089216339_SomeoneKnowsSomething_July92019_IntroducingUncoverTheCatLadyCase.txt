this is a CBC podcast awful awful foggy cuz I always get up at 5 in the morning good night I was Hunter II hunt and 7 in the morning to shots but when I looked in the binoculars it was like Two Silhouettes and then I couldn't see from overdose I would look like another silhouette okay that was it cuz it's very very foggy like it's like white just two shots and then a couple hours later that's when the shed down below by the water in November 1998 a 77 year-old woman went missing from Muskoka Ontario her name was John Lawrence but everyone called her the cat lady dinner portion I've never been a bullshiter in my life and I'm scared to talk talk right now you guys see you guys say that and I'm scared I know what's going to happen Earl a Twitchy Lumberjack with bloodshot eyes were sitting in my car on the side of a muddy Lake West of Huntsville through the windshield is an old dumping site where he says the Silhouettes disposed of something couple hours later there's a shed that was burned down by the water and then they were burnt and then they started cleaning up the backbone and this is why they dumped one load hair and one load up around the corner and then I think one load out the road by the used to live beside the dump site across the lake from where John Wayne Messin With Sasquatch this whole scene play out gunshots fire backhoe and then what happens if you go to the police Bob says a little less than a year later he was arrested for being drunk in public and try to tell them then and they basically said earlier just to you're just a drunk sleep it off I said I'm drunk but I'm not a drunk and all I got to know what I do Ikea employees paychecks going every Friday and I'm not a drop in just a drunk did you guys will figure it out might take a twenty-year-old we'll figure it out before 20 years as well all right where we are I'm Sandra Sherman this is uncover the cat lady case there's a story I like to tell about Muskoka it's about a guy who goes into the woods and never comes out police suspect suicide but can't find his body 30 years later some Hunters come across a pile of bones and an old rope in the spot where they find him is just a few feet from his house he was right there the whole time but that's Muskoka for you the woods will swallow you Muskoka is Canada's Cottage Country Hamptons of the north one of National Geographic top 10 places to visit in the summer as I'm working on this podcast Hallmark comes to film a movie here another reminder that to the outside world this place is greeting card perfect but I live in Muskoka I was born here and I see the other side the side where people live in poverty commit crimes the side I started investigating in 2014 when I first heard about this story in 2017 I brought my research to cbc's The Fifth Estate which made a documentary now I'm using new tips and information to take the story even further starting with the cat lady she was a visibly homeless woman who lived in Huntsville muskokas largest town that the only town in the area to have both a men's and women's shelter she was in the background of people's lives for 20 years a blur on the side of the road a face you passed on the street yeah I just seen it a very very distinctive Silhouettes and very recognizable when you see her walking into town with a skirts and usually carrying bags and scarf and her hair was a nice shade of brown she always wore it in a pageboy she looked a lot older I think for her age like weathered she always wore a scarf in the summer it was the rayon type curci and in the winter it was kind of a woman one that she wore tide uncapped dirty just looked like somebody that live down the street sometimes people called her the bag lady because she always had bags from the A&P I have a few cat and I lost track of how many there were but there was never a lot of groceries it was mostly cat food in her bags she carries them to Time Walk ahead a little put them down go back for the rest I felt bad I felt like I needed to do something I just couldn't go by and watch her with all those groceries and hitchhiking I casually set don't you have any family and she immediately looked at me and she says do you have any siblings just wouldn't answer me and I said do you have any children no answer no one knew where Joan had come from and a lot of people couldn't remember a time she hadn't been there it was like she had always belonged at the landscape just a little old lady standing by the side of the road there was just you know never anything if you ask for anything personal she would shut down on you she would change the subject immediately she wouldn't answer my question for years the cat lady lived in a derelict house with no heat or running water after it burned down in 1994 she drifted between boarding houses and the Salvation Army in the Hallmark version of Huntsville where everyone's young pretty and Rich she was remarkable just for being different she didn't seem to be an unhappy person you know most people they chew about something if it's not the weather or whatever but she never did not about anything but the thing is because she had if she had a scene delayed or something but it was her right to live how she wanted even though I disagree with how she was living because I didn't feel safe for her but she seem like a smart woman and we talked about them on a regular basis disappearance the cat lady seem to be living west of Huntsville Paper Factory she asked people who gave her rides to drop her off before they actually saw where then she just wasn't around anymore I think the like everybody else sometime it was concerned as to how could something like this happen in small town Ontario being a small-town that's I guess that's not how we think I never thought that I always knew something had happened to her just to just vanish like that there was a rumble about it oh I heard that maybe you know she was gone to Parry Sound or she moved away or she said she died or there was a murder on November 25th 1998 a 28 year old detective named Ehrenberg was assigned to locate Joan Aaron have joined at the Ontario Provincial Police the opp six years earlier quickly rising to the rank of a plainclothes investigator Aaron wouldn't talk to me for this podcast but I have her ideas or information to obtain along with other police documents it ozar what Police use to get search warrants they contain allegations not fax The defen Proven in court most ideas have names dates details are like Diaries this is how Aaron starts with ask someone else to read them for us on Wednesday November 25th Sandra Gordon from probation and parole services in Margaret pigeon from Adult Protective Services attended the residence of a male person by the name of Alan Alda Marshall Marshall is on probation in Gordon is his probation officer Gordon and pigeon attended his residence to check on his well-being during their visit Marshall inform them that an elderly woman by the name of Joan Lawrence lived on the property as well and that he was concerned because he had not seen her for at least three weeks which was highly unusual this guy on Marshall with a 57 year old former limo driver in 1997 he moved from Toronto to Muskoka and lift on the same property as Joan 2 picture this property imagine 50 football fields covered in trees the driveway cuts down the middle and over a bump of railroad track on either side are piles of junk abandoned vehicles old hot water heaters are also cabins in Oak buildings on Marshall lives in a cabin by the road and John lives in another by the lake John has the same on our way down the driveway and back again she stops and says hi and bring some caramel bars from town so outhouses probation officer he hasn't seen Joan in a while to probation officer reports her missing now this detective Ehrenberg is looking into things Bridge Detachment and requested that observation be kept for drum I also contacted all of the motels in Bracebridge and Gravenhurst in an effort to try and locate Joe was call all the motels in the area maybe Joan had moved off the property just got tired of living there and that's why I'll head and seen her but no one did any of them down smashed John's description send Erin writes that she got in touch with the clerk at Huntsville Law Firm I think she need to do this because her boss's wife was Al Marshalls probation officer so John must have mentioned that she was seeing this law clerk than out house is po the PO tells her husband and if he owes husband tells Eren just one of those small-town things anyway since the law clerk told her that yes the cat lady used to come in here all the time she was helping her out with something helping me out with what and wanted to know turn the clerk apparently drop this bomb the first real piece of the puzzle she told Aaron that she was helping John file a report to take the opp that John was anxiously stopping by every couple of days to quote see how the paperwork was coming the last time this awkward said she saw Joan she told her the paperwork was finally ready and she could come in and pick it up the clerk hadn't seen her since hey Xander can I still see their pajama day at work on this particular day we're meeting at my house and she's wearing a flannel onesie I like to think of it as a metaphor for how unpretentious how straight up Linda is there's nothing superficial about her slender works at a daycare now for the 1998 shoes the deli manager at the A&P that was how she met Joan I used to make coffee for customers we still have free coffee so course I'm out on the floor and so she just came up to the coffee pot and I you know said good morning and we just chatted Linda likes cats too and at first that was how they bonded you know me noticing the can cat food in the winter cart and we talked about her cats at us when we got to know John better she began to see another side everyone called her the cat lady and I guess when someone mentioned cat lady of course it's like who's the cat lady but didn't take long for me once I got to know where that I didn't I didn't refer to her as a cat lady I I referred to as Joan you described her eyes as being kind yes yes yes she did have kind eyes yes because some when I would talk to her I would look into her eyes what did you see some days I would see desperation hun if she told you not to tell me about her living arrangements so when we had conversations about that she always says her eyes were just like she was just like living on the edge the place John was living the place she didn't want anyone to see was a small garden shed I sent thinking about the shed and the best way to describe it and I'm just going to say it exactly what it sounds like it's just a shed there's no electricity running water no bathroom it's not even insulated and when Joan is renting in because oh yeah she was renting it the only heat source with a portable heater that was plugged into an extension cord according to Linda by the fall of 1998 even that was gone that would there was no heat or the heater is broken and the landlord didn't fix it and she was freezing to death so she kept an eye on Joan at the A&P not just at the coffee stand but around the store then one day I saw Joan approach this man up by the front Cash's at the front of the store at this cowboy hat on kind of skinny guy kind of creepy looking to me she had his hand out and she was putting like bills like money into his hand just counting it out and I just remember her just keep handing it and piling it and handing it and handing at night I knew it was a large amount of money from the fact that she just kept dishing it out and dishing it out and I saw after she finished putting the last dollar or whatever amount of money it wasn't his hand he just looked at it looked at her put it in his pocket walked right away from her walk out the door and she just stood there kind of slumped in a way like like I don't know how to describe it just like feeling of defeat again I think just I mean he could have drove her home but he just left her standing there he got what he wanted and that was it Jones friend with $600 a month I've known this detail for a while now but I still take every opportunity to tell people $600 in 1998 that's almost $900 today everyone I tell this to says it's deplorable which of course it is but I'm looking for something more like who would take advantage of someone like that what kind of a person would allow someone to live in an 8 x 10 shed much less charge them rent some people ask where junk email with the money between a pension and her old age security she got about $900 a month. Left her about $300 to spend on her cats which everyone said she would feed before feeding herself in fact John got her own food from the food bank so any extra money coming in was important life-changing Ethan and in 1998 that was her income tax check she was in the store and course I said hi and we're talkin to bed and she asked me questions she goes Linda did you get your income tax back yet and I said oh yeah Joe and I got that months ago I said why because I haven't gotten mine and I went really well you should have got it because yeah I don't I don't know I didn't get it and I said well you should look into that you know and she was kind of saying that she might have thought that our landlord cashed it or whatever and I said well that's you know that's not right I said you you better look into that so she said you know I'm going to look into that I said okay good yeah I was waiting for you to come back and tell me what what happened with her money because she she was waiting for that money and depending on that money and that's a that's the last time that's our last conversation I never saw her again detective Erin Burke believe she had just learned something big John was supposed to report the theft of hurricane come tax check just as that was sinking in got another call it was from L Marshall the tenant who first noticed John was missing Baron General Lee Road Lawrence for John Lawrence but we'll be using Joan when reading from Aaron's i t o's and in some spots for clarity who changed the wording of parents statements slightly in this part Aaron describes an individual who was concerned because he observed someone operating a backhoe in Joan he stated that around the same time that he observed the backhoe being operated he heard gunshots for 20 years all Marshall has been a crucial that problematic part of the police investigation into John's disappearance he died a few years ago and I don't know anyone else who saw or heard what he did which could be one of the reasons no charges have ever been laid then just as I started working on this podcast I heard from Lumberjack Bob Earl darden.com call Teresa cuz I don't like Viator okay Teresa is bought X in case you were wondering this is something he does talks as if you've known him for years and she did a lot of she would have been honest with their dad my dad wouldn't wouldn't had a hole in his leg and you know it was a court order to go get my equipment like a lot of people I first heard about Bob Earl the 2005 Toronto life story called The Other Muskoka the story is about a shootout between Bob's family and his in-laws it was a big deal and in Muskogee it made by famous or maybe Infamous I can't really tell just like Al Marshall Bob says he heard gunshots and witnessed a backhoe being operated around the time of John's disappearance all says he heard about a fire but claims he actually saw it data silhouette burned a shed which according to the ideas may have been a previous shutdown was living in but there's one thing Bob says he saw that I'll never reported someone dumping something on a nearby property a spot locals treated like an unofficial dumping grounds and I think I hold that that key you want to show me where they dump Bob and I are out of my car now walking through the old dump site across the road from his former hubs this gate wasn't here but the gate wasn't here a couple of hours after seeing the fire Bob says he was working in the yard on the truck pulled up right across from him Bob says the people driving the truck will using their own property as a kind of landfill but chose this spot to get rid of whatever they had burned in the dump over here I'll be coming back to the dump site later for now I asked Bob why he's telling me any of this I mean after the Tron of Life article after allegedly being ignored by the cops my trust me my trust anyone you know I know I went missing and my brother much as we don't have we never said we love each other or my brothers are not whole family but we do we protect each other right so I know ice went missing in my brother 10 years later somebody told him something I'm sure he can go his power to put closer to it right and I think that's what I'm doing is I want Susan there's a brother or sister out there. Or family member that wants closer to this and then if it is if it does come out and my facts are right well I'm sure that's it's the stories to punish the people that did it and I think I told that that key I guess what I'm saying is I know what it's going to bring the heat on me and sometimes it's best just look the other way but then I'm the guy that's got to carry it and that's what I've done of carrier for 20 years by the fall of 1998 John was getting desperate she feared for her safety and told the social worker to call 911 if anything happened has Linda remembers John seemed especially concerned about her landlord tell me that the landlord did offer that you know she could come in and take a bath and use the toilet which I'm thinking of myself like she didn't have a toilet shouldn't have running water shouldn't have you know a bath or shower or anyting so I immediately said we'll Joan like why don't you go in there and use the the toilet and have a shower and stuff no because her hygiene was not very good so I just like it was kind of like saying I don't use the shower and go in there she goes no I never go in there and I would have went why like I was puzzled I didn't understand and she goes so I know I'd never go in there she goes you just never know what he's going to do Joan had always rejected people's offers of help but now she turned them sought them out even this is a retired OPP officer who used to give her rides one day when I text Rob Weber and I use I have to stop at my parents place which is night on the rug into town and meet her in the backyard. Live there is no, everyone said no to Joan they didn't know where to put her didn't know what to do with her cats John refused to put them in a shelter or give them up for adoption with no one else to turn to she asked her friend Linda if she could come and stay with her when she did you know when she did reach out to ask me for help which was probably extremely hard for her to do and that she had trusted me enough to even ask me and then when I refused her and then that must of liked that probably was made her feel like like like I have nobody I just I don't know I feel bad sorry Joan 7 weeks after John went missing detective Ehrenberg got enough evidence together for a search warrant at dawn on December 17th she and a convoy of police vehicle descended the long driveway of Jones last known address this is someone who was there that day she's asked not to be identified for fear of retribution it's almost like it's a big private and then I remember the long driveway up to where the house was and a long was along the driveway and on on the left all these abandoned vehicles it was all like you know oh my gosh I mean this is disgusting that was my feeling and I'm certainly you know the feeling I got that everybody would leave a person to live in those kind of condition and I never saw but I did hear that you know they is found around the shed police searched the property combed the woods dug up the earth eventually dredge the lake hey can you find John's body but to everyone who knew her they had found all the evidence they needed if the cat lady's cats were dead so she God I'm just like I I just do anything wrong she loved your cats I mean what's wrong with that I can't believe this is terrible there's one thing I haven't told Sunday yet I know who detective Ehrenberg believed killed the cats police found some of the cats when they went and searched the property and they found bullet fragments in the cat's one of the weapons that's missing that we can see that's missing in these documents as a rifle who knows what else that right for might have been used for coming up on time cover mean stepping on the cat and taunting her is different from getting a gun and just like cuz she had over 30 cats be like an execution was a lynx that you're hurt or something of that she says no I think it sounded like a human being.
