season three I can't leave at 36 episodes of disgrace land in one Elton John interview over the past fifteen months and we just passed 16 million total download what's in the show continues to grow I

Tuesday when I'm watching episode pump to see what kind of response to story will get and what parts of the storytelling that you are respond to as mention we've launched 36 full episodes so my top five disgrace and episodes Rob Gordon Championship vinyl High Fidelity stylist goes like this number 5 Sid Vicious this was the fourth or fifth episode I wrote and produced and I remember that for this one this is the episode where is felt where I was kind of on to something I remember voicing the ending and feeling like okay this is interesting what did I just do number for Jim Morrison is the Zodiac Killer because we're crazy fucking idea Jim Morrison is the Zodiac Killer researching and writing this was extra fun for obvious reasons is the first fictional episode that I've done for satire episode of my co-writer on this Taylor but instead and I went deep on the research and correlating Jim's activities and traits of the zodiac Killer's and it worked it actually full people going to jail cuz up there actually into the gag we took a chance held their breath drove in and people are into it and there are few things more rewarding than taking a risk creatively feeling that fear doing the damn thing whatever that is and then having nothing be accepted by your audience number three big Lurch because this episode surprised even me and I was the one who was writing it and once I learned the story I was grossed out and didn't want to ride it but as soon as I get into it particularly the hardcore angle I got really into it and that inspired the horror flick score and sound design this is also the episode where I feel like Shawn Cahalan my engineer and I started to really mess with sound design in a way that excited me and got me stoked on creating more episodes number to Frank Sinatra because the mafia politics music in Hollywood for my favorite things to talk about all coalesce in this story plus I got to talk like a tough guy for a minute which is always fun and number one Kurt and Courtney episode 2 because I wrote my heart out in this one because it's about my family because it's about my brother because in some ways to me represents the most insane year of my life 2018 the year disgrace them launched intense highs and intense Lowe's because when I finished writing it I quite literally very nearly collapsed reading it was cathartic feeling the response from listeners was affirming this one is more than a podcast episode to me it's a moment in time a moment in my life Elizabeth Rhodes I feel like the big Lurch episode gets the least amount of heat I don't think people realize when they see an artist name that they don't necessarily know just how crazy the story is for those who don't know a big Lurch was a hip hop artist who is currently in prison for eating his roommate yes eating his roommate music clip lyrics sad studio in 2K The Sounds around banging these West Coast dudes knew what was up the producer Rodger Troutman Jr son of

so as many of you know we just finalized season 3 with an episode on the Rolling Stones and their time on the French Riviera as they begin recording what would become their Masterpiece Exile on Main Street record I refer to in the episode is being the greatest rock and roll record of all time us statement that apparently all of you agree with because nobody took the cheese on that one and challenged me which I got to say is kind of disappointing music is obviously subjective and one man's Exile on Main Street is another man's Dirty Work who that man is however I don't know but I like to meet him is there a few things I can explain to him is a clip from the most recent episode of The Rolling Stones fugitives in Exile Keith Richards had a lot on his mind which was saying something for a man who is The Rock and Roll equivalent of great white shark the most dangerous animal in the ocean that basically has two thoughts kill similarly the guitar player for the most dangerous band on the planet the Rolling Stones spent his days with basically only two thoughts of a sewn rock and roll music roll he left most of the Rock part 2 Mick Jagger singer a man who woke up everyday with a precise list of things to accomplish to propel is banned in his career forward to satisfy the desires of partnership was more complimentary than any other in this still young genre Midwood sex Keith was drugs and together they were rock and roll unlike mixed Keith rolled out of bed and move through his days to the Natural rhythms of the world around if his main priority was always playing guitar making music writing songs but not in the formal I'm going to sit down and write a song about X and has a really like why it moves to the bridge that sounds like seeing this perfectly calibrated for pop Superstar success or if I for Keith it was all of a Fiat 500 Perpetual dancing to use that Becky took his acoustic guitar with everywhere and playing it to priority for everything he slept with any fell asleep laying in the middle of recording session takes of this band sitting around Dumbfoundead helpless to do anything but wait until the guitar player songwriter awoke hopefully still bound

last time I recorded one of these after-parties I saw Harmony korine's Beach Bum with Matthew McConaughey and I laughed almost the whole way through even though it was a comedy this is Pete McConaughey it's wooderson with longer hair and quite possibly more drugs is full Livin Madness in a lot of fun it is the kids and it's not even Spring Breakers Corinne's earlier movies but it's damn entertaining cover the mcconaghy and stay for the Snoop Dogg who is heavily featured a character largely based on himself it's G-funk on 11. New watching Snoop acted this movie you're quickly reminded of this guy's Charisma and charm it's so fucking effortless so genuine it's the reason the Charisma not as music to the world loves it some Snoop despite much of the bullshit he's pulled over the years beating a murder rap becoming a pimp etcetera so if that here's a clip from the Snoop Dogg episode is Graceland as far back as I can remember he always wanted to be a pimp snoop through up is Calvin Broadus Jr in Long Beach California east side or the PCH the prostitutes her own free who's pimple at the neighborhood was a remnant of what had become of long Beach's notorious Oceanfront slum known as The Jungle by the 1980's and 1990's the sailors and dockworkers from earlier in the century have been replaced by the gang Bangerz and traveling businessmen and The Pimps ruled it all in style as a kid Snoop Vibes on Iceberg Slim whose autobiography pimp The Story of My Life crop pimping out of the shadows and on the bookshelves alongside books by black power I contact Malcolm X young Snoop wasn't the only one it's real by culture 70s filmmakers could put the pimps down either Harvey Keitel sport from Taxi Driver in Rudy Ray Moore Dolemite give young kids in the seventies glamorized view into the CD underbelly of a street dolomites comedic blend on blaxploitation was particularly compelling dolomites my fucking ass motherfuckers is my game I'm Dolomite I want to kill Monday whoop Tuesday for Wednesday in the hospital called up Thursday to tell Friday not to bury Saturday on a Sunday I'm the one I'm the one with the elephant roosting in trees and plants were DVDs these characters in these films were part of the hood curriculum for Sue years later after becoming a hip hop sensation super tries hand of pimping for real at least two women doing at all times sometimes as many as ten all various hotel rooms and heated book to Jason whatever hotel suite you staying in while on the road back in 2003 his clients were entertainers and athletes Discerning clientele who could afford the services of Snoop so-called hose and also keep a secret Snoop couldn't believe the money was generated by this time Snoop is one of the biggest stars and it is experienced pimping along with his love for dolomite Ford eventually informs later performance in 2004 Starsky and Hutch Huggy pimped-out underworld contact for Ben Stiller Starsky and Owen Wilson's Hutch all right that's soup dog and now for whatever they want to talk about Quentin Tarantino's new movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood I saw this over the weekend it's tough to remember the last time I was just excited to see the movies release I love Quentin Tarantino he's made two of my favorite movies of all time Pulp Fiction which I saw in the theater for its Manhattan release with Tarantino in the audience and taking questions afterward and of course Reservoir Dogs both movies are incredible the great great. After that are Tarantino movies that I like a whole lot Jackie Brown in Death Proof among the top of that second tier list but none that achieve the greatness like those first two movies Django Kill Bill and the rest of Tarantino's movies are all good but they're step down in my opinion if I were making the top five Rob Gordon Championship final list of Tarantino movies that go Pulp Fiction 1 Reservoir Dogs 2 and then I don't know how great those two movies are I'm hard pressed to even find a three or four or five to come close I think I go Jackie Brown Death Proof for and then it gets real hard because in my view Tarantino's other films barely come close to these for Kill Bill volume 1 comes the closest but still not that close Inglourious Basterds was good but not even close to great in Django seemed a little too much like Tarantino doing Tarantino and I straight-up just didn't really like hateful eight despite its great title so I've been waiting anxiously for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood it's Tarantino who am I opinion is overdue at Hollywood in Charles Manson sigh me the fuck up and it did not disappoint it's clear from watching this movie that Quentin Tarantino is love but not with himself as a filmmaking and hateful eight would have you believe that he's in love with Hollywood we knew this already from the many Tinseltown and Maj as he pays tribute to a previous movies but this movie is a straight-up gosh Fest from Musso & Franks up to the Hollywood Hills to Cielo drive to spawn Ranch and everywhere else Hollywood in 1969 is the leading lady in this movie much more than Margo Robbie who is Thoroughly enjoyable despite being outshined by the glow Tarantino's Hometown this movie is not what I wanted it to be a film is entertaining and groundbreaking is Pulp Fiction but that's an impossible expectation it is however a great movie Brad Pitt Leonardo DiCaprio are both incredible in fact might be my favorite performance of both Megastar Leading Men DiCaprio despite being the biggest act around a planet still seems to be growing as a talent right in front of our eyes and Brad Pitt in this role is making the case that no one on the planet is having more fun right now than he is I love both performances along with Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate in the mill Hershey is Jay Sebring also Mama Cass in the Playboy Mansion wolves tooth in the return of Red Apple cigarettes make this all worth the price of admission is Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as good as Pulp Fiction or even Reservoir Dogs know but what is is it is next best movie possibly better than Jackie Brown or Death Proof maybe I think so it might be a little bit longer and see it again is it better than the rest of his movies yes I believe so but more important than all that to me it's a comeback is Quentin Tarantino pushing himself forward making a film about the love of his life Hollywood and totally worth your time and your dime that's my $0.10 anyway let me know what you guys think hit me up on Instagram and Twitter Facebook let me know what you think of Tarantino's new movie and what you think is top 5 films are all right speaking of Hollywood send up some paint Gamache the great films here's my son up a Martin scorsese's Raging Bull from the cardi B episode the scene where Robert De Niro confronts Joe Pesci his character's brother about sleeping with his wife you know the famous you fuck my wife scene here we go then she turned to the bar again that's what she felt it crash right across your pretty face glass ice spearing off then the swarm of bugs at the bar someone grabbed her hair pulled her down all she could do is hear that voice that familiar stick Bronx accent you fuck my husband why my husband actually ask me a question like that actually ask me I'm sister you ask me that what are you get your balls big enough to ask me that again the Bronx accent voice but now closer to her about her hovering just tell me jade.
