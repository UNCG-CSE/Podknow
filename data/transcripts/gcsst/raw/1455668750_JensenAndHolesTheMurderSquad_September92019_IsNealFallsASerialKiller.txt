the door he was like I said how are you doing and he was like I'm fine and then soon as I turn my head he was right up against me with a gun in my face that he said live or die and I said what I need to live or die and he smiled and then I was like oh no no no no no I said you can't do this much my friends are outside it was like and I just be quiet now they're not and I took off running straight to my back door and he was right behind me I hit off today but he lost the right behind me and then he grabbed my throat cuz I was starting to scream for my buddy and he grabs hold of my throat and squeezed and he didn't let go to the whole time he said I'm going to prison for a long time there's no doubt about that it's your decision whether it'll be 4 murder or rape and murder and I was like what I guess that's what he has on maybe he had let other females before make the choice whether he would write them after he killed them or just kill them and I cried like this can't happen this can't happen this isn't happening and I just started fighting country in many cases when were taken from their home towns across state lines before their bodies were disposed nothing seemed to connect the cases that is until a heroic woman falling off her attacker and killed him with his own gun in Charleston West Virginia when police looked in the attackers vehicle they discovered a sledgehammer cleaning fluids guns knives a shuttle handcuffs in a bulletproof vest otherwise known as a kill kit woman was only trying to save her life but when police arrived on scene it became clear she may have saved many others aside from the kill kit they also found a Post-It note with the names ages and phone numbers of C other women authorities believe he may have already been a serial killer or at least a serial killer in the making the families of the missing and murdered women across the country were hoping the answers our job get those answers this is the murder Squad play Billy Paul doing good now what you doing right there what's that alright so I'll go to school for my birthday a couple months ago Polly got me a diary and it's Tom Riddle's Diary from who becomes Voldemort's Arie spoiler alert Potter and the cold in the Harry Potter books and the cool thing about this diary is that it comes with invisible ink and then you write an invisible ink in there that you have this little wand in the Concho see what you just wrote have you written anything yet I see that murder Works real thank you poly so much for this by the way thank you choose presents for me sounds cool you also gave

you very much I do I carry this with me all the all the time for Tom marvolo Riddle who becomes one of the worst villains in the in the history of literature but I'm going to use this for other means for good I'm going to use the is that right there for good was going to say it really suck though if you lost that wand and I wouldn't be I doubt I can write the Next Great American novel in here and if I lose the one I'm down here done absolutely is matcha okay now let's go to Vegas 2003 on March 6th 2003 two bikers or find a torso in black plastic bags bed sheets was just outside of Las Vegas on All State Route 159 on a road that led to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation area until they match the blonde woman Mystery Science March 2003 five months later on the 9th of August 14th to go out on a date appearance in the casino industry from the time he was young she told her mother Pam how she want to open your own beauty salon with those drinks stalled when she dropped out of high school sex work around the Edge of Seventeen when he first found out she freaked and kicked out of the house but after she turned 18 Jody move back in with her mother and her sister on Jones Boulevard offer to help Jody out of the sex worker industry but Jodi like that she liked the amount of money that she was making and that you could make in the short amount of time so Cal remembered seeing Jody before she went out on the night of August 14th she said her newly dyed blonde hair look like a Halo Jody told her mom she loved her and Hannah said she would see her tomorrow Jodi was dropped off at the Harbor Island Club Apartments on East Harmon Avenue when is said they saw Jodi get into a white car with California license plates but Jodi never came home her mother Pamela reporter Jodi missing the next day was recovered in San Bernardino County California 25 miles South of the california-nevada Border authorities were able to identify it as Jodi Brewer by matching her tattoos hummingbird above her left breast and an M design on her lower back so we have these two cases now both torsos we don't know if they're connected or not but what does this mean this dismemberment what does it mean for this type of offender anytime you see somebody who's taking the oath of the step the steps to dismember a body yeah this this is not your average person I mean it's it takes a special person to take the effort to cut a body up they have to have that kind of that mental fortitude in order to put themselves through that and I seen cases where they do it once and they don't do it again it's not their thing that can I get grossed out but if they're doing it more than once then they recognize that that is going to be kind of self-preservation aspects discussed that they may be experiencing while they do it years later York show me the Henderson Nevada 2 years prior to going missing after me shut off with a hip-hop concert in New York so she moves across the country and she she she got a job in the area but you didn't tell them that she also got involved in history on May 4th 2005 from Lindsey later that day Lindsay was seen on surveillance in a Bank of America ATM depositing money she constantly checked in with them but after that call the text stop coming in and he knew something was wrong he called her parents tell him to report a missing and hopped on a plane back to Nevada from Syracuse I seen going north on Las Vegas Boulevard between 5 a.m. in the Luxor parking lot they also located a rental car that was in her name a block from Henderson home law enforcement immediately began looking into Lindsay's boyfriend despite the fact that he was across the country meanwhile 1600 miles away near Springfield Illinois three boys out riding ATVs came across with the first thought were props but as it got closer it became clear they were looking at real human legs when you talk about my grandma before somebody dismembering a body with a big body dismemberment case that we think of is the Black Dahlia case the the strange thing about that is because I wasn't doing it for preservation dissected the body and put a bisector the body and put it right out there for everybody to see what body parts are different places but now we've got somebody that's in Vegas going from Vegas 600 miles away that's the first big one in terms of try not to hide your tracks in the second one is quite possibly is putting body parts all across the strip so you know where's the rest of her that's obvious obvious tool marks indicating its dismemberment versus what's a animal activity then you got to start thinking okay I've got other body parts somewhere typically if it's a local guy killing a local victim District was in Las Vegas 1600 miles away so you could be scattered Across the Nation in the legs didn't have signs of decomp the nails were painted and a tattoo is still intact but it would take three years before DNA would be matched to that of Lindsay but while Lindsey's family waiting for answers yet another family would just start their search in April 2005 a blond hazel-eyed young woman left her home and ended up in Nevada Jessica Jessie Foster been a man in Canada where she was from the man invited her to travel with him to Atlantic City Atlantic City they went to Las Vegas was supposed to be a short trip but Jesse kept making excuses to not come home it was during this trip that our family believe she became sex trafficked once a man that was Peter Todd she's moving in with him and then they became engaged after Jesse became involved with Todd she was arrested twice on charges relating to sex work in June and September of 2005 after the first arrest according to hospital records Todd beer breaking her jaw before she disappeared she took a trip home for the holidays in 2005 but left right after opening presents on Christmas morning they still stayed in contact by phone but that would stop just a few short months later on March 28th 2006. She's family heard from her for the last time that Jesse left him on April 3rd he came to the house while she was supposed to be except her makeup and hair dryer or gone along with Jesse her family said those were items that Jesse would never leave behind though but perhaps the strange side of Left Behind and Untouched by Jesse was a $20,000 in her bank account from a car accident settlement it was money their family says she was going to use to go to school Jesse hasn't been seen since I use a credit card or her phone since March 28th 2006 could be a serial killer long-haul trucker hunting in Las Vegas and the fact that the legs of Lindsey Harris are found 1600 miles away pointed to a killer who is Barry mobile as this is all unfolding medalist from the Oklahoma Bureau Investigation was spotting a pattern not necessarily from Vegas but close to where she was she was seeing all these bodies deposited along Interstate 40 and this was the starting point for the FBI's Highway serial killings initiative database victims found near the interstate now that number is up to 700 to truckers and we do know that they're certainly have been trucker serial killers before they are typically picking up women at a speed truck stops in a lot of the truck stops have clamped down on that but you pick up a woman from one location you potentially kill them in your in your truck turn to another location nobody is looking for them for a while and she might be a Jane Doe in the other location it seems like this with the FBI has is that this is more of a Perfect Crime than most because it is so mobile and because we know that our as we talked about before our law enforcement doesn't really talk to each other as much as they should especially when you start getting you know it's one thing within a state from County to County you know in terms of law enforcement communicating that kind of move into another County you might not see that communication efficient as if it were within the same state to state bordering states have different systems that don't communicate how do you spell communicate questions about trying to start an unsolved murders database and I was working on it with some guys were going to pull information basically scrape information from across the web and there were certain websites that had stuff together Ohio I remember had a database of 5000 is 220000 is like well let's just a drop in the bucket the information is scattered it's everywhere and nobody has you know what we're getting there with name s we're getting there with these other places but as far as outside murders in one place that we would like to be able to use like we're talking about with last episode of searching for victims that might have been you know found outside females with their pants that have been sexually assaulted just put those terms into a search engine and have everything spit back at you is supposed to do that in terms of have a question are passing investigator you fill out detailed information about your case it gets put into the program that was started when we fill out that question are there if they do that either don't do it as thoroughly as it should be or they don't have the expertise to be able to fill out the details that would be able to be actively search the database to keep what I think should happen is all of these journalists that have gotten ahead of new jobs well as the newspaper apartment rent have them every time they pick up a couple bottles of vodka that could happen if anything is going to be seen But the skill set is out there and these detectives are so overworked. We seen Cold Case departments start and then just dry up 2 weeks to months later or because there's not that immediate satisfy ministration comes out there is out there it's just a you know it's one extra line item in a budget that can make this happen to order Squad there is a there's a fantasy aspect there is no behavioral aspect and usually now but you're you're looking for somebody who's been trained into offender behaviors looking for those signature elements that's will stand out and that's where I seen some of these vicap question are some of the significant behaviors that these offenders are what these vendors are doing that are somewhat unique to them that would then be able to be searched they were standardized pull out a few words but it's this offender likes to this is liking to use to strangle and once we should allow them to come back alive and play that God that's a significant Defender and many investigators aren't looking at that aspect that they can see evidence of that within the crime scene itself in the autopsy itself and not just for unsolved murders but also potentially for sexual assault that he might have done that before sexual assault and that's how to identify him and then he graduates to murder potentially and liking all those together and that's where we end up here in July 2015 Heather salt made a date man off of backpage.com sex worker she gave the man her address the man arrived at our home and the woman immediately knew something was wrong he walked in and immediately asked her live or die the date ended with this 911 call right now where is the guy at do you know who the guy is she said no deliver. All right I'm not sure what kind of weapon did he play with his gun is in a white male and black male you know what color clothing just remember what color shirt and she left a male standing in the kitchen what is your name sweetie okay okay is she bleeding from where she looks like she has medicine marks around her neck and she does have a little bit of blood out light scratches on her fingers was she able to enter him in any way. Tell us that I know it's a story that you told a bunch of times but initially come in contact with false down to take me out just a missile and they sleep just introduced ourselves more than anything at first but as soon as I don't know something was funny about the whole situation but I was I don't know just a busy day I was just really in a rush. I didn't pay much attention to all the little things that I should have now that I think back you know but we were supposed to just meet get to know each other that day and but it took him like 7 hours to finally get to my house he kept calling back so I didn't know what was going there was he saying and calling me from different location and Charleston and I was like if he calls back again he's saying that he's not coming he's just he's finally showed up and he was standing out in the driveway he pulled in down the road in front of me and drove all the way down to the very end of the road and came back and then pulled in my driveway had I known what he was doing he was probably there trying to find a way make sure you can get away out and make sure there was no you know please sir I don't know you know what I know he was just looking for us in case before you even pulled in but I didn't know that fan when he first got there but he was in such like a rush it was speed walking to get in the car to get in my house and I don't even think you say no I don't know but across the street to get some soda and and then soon as I turn my head he was right up against me with a gun in my side he said liver died and I said what and he said liver guy and he smiled and then I was like oh no no no no no my friends are outside it was like you know just be quiet mother or not I took off running straight to my back door and he was right behind me I hit it right behind me and then he grabbed my throat my throat and squeezed and he didn't let go the whole time I didn't get any are the whole time it was horrible it was a fight after that standing up or are you guys on the ground was going on we were standing up and he was like because I kept trying to scream my buddy's name the whole time but he would not let go I thought for just a second he was going to keep me quiet but I think he was going to kill me right then and there and couldn't wait to get inside and he can't wait to anyone me to be calm about it it was like calm down just calm down you know let me tell you what I tell you and I was like oh Lordy don't don't I'm going to prison for a long time there's no doubt about that he said it's your decision whether it'll be for murder or rape and murder and I was like what I guess that's what he had or maybe he had let other females before make the choice whether he would write them after he killed did you say anything I just just I'm kind of just a kind of cried like this can be like if he hadn't shot me yet he wasn't going to shoot me there he was dressed to the party until he had that done this before he was maneuvering me perfect hand me down and no time and I took a breath for so long I was like please please please let me breathe and by this by this point I was in the floor like grabbing for anything and he had even his clothes were soaked in skin tight I couldn't even get a hold of anything I couldn't call nothing well the night before that for some reason brought in a little tiny right from outside and I guess I catch a wow well when I was in the store and he was pretty much and he shut the gun down under the kitchen table but not and he said the kitchen table and he was like I was so weak I probably couldn't have done anything when he pulled me up by my throat say it again lay in bed and I just I had took a breath and so long I don't even think about anything I grabbed it and just reached and then I can finally breathe but I was out here for a long time but I can finally breathe and it was finally over so I was in such it was so bad wow how to say that in so they did the beep was the ring in your ears I guess from his belt. Hung on the back door knob and he was hanging off of the back door he had his arm on the kitchen counter but he was just hang in there and yeah it was even worse because I didn't know what to do and I had to literally move my recliner in front of the front door that's how bad we was fighting inside there that I had to literally move furniture to get outside of my house that's how bad he was throwing me all over the house but when you shot out immediately drop and stop what he was doing to you I was scared that he was either almost like almost a I just know that run and I turned and I seen him and I know he was dead like it was instant I guess yeah I don't know he might have found this picture self back up for a second because we wasn't as close to the back door when I had shot him but we were getting towards the back door he was trying to pull me out and yeah he ended up his belt was hanging off of the back door knob when the police found him getting in shape isn't just about losing weight it's about feeling better about yourself whether that means having more energy to keep up with your busy life fitting into those goal jeans being more in tune with your body's needs are practicing better self-care Noom is a habit changing solution that helps users develop a new relationship with food through personalized choices with Noom no food is good bad or off-limits instead noon teaches moderation by helping you to track meal habits visualize portion sizes and see calorie density at a glance it can even be used in conjunction with many pre-existing popular diets I know my specific goal I always want to be trying to stay lean but also maintain a certain level of muscle mass for my fitness and with new mile be able to see macros in that the level of protein that I'm taking in order to make sure that I'm ensuring that I'm taking in the nutrients I need to meet my fitness goals you don't have to change everything all in one day small steps make big progress sign up for your trial today at noon Noom.

I'm just been blown away by the strength of the resilience that you you showed to be able to get away from this guy I eat I think it's important to understand his approach to you he gets there and he is approaching you he's all East tunnel vision but when he is talking to you on the phone how is he on the phone what is he saying why are you all the way over here I don't know if he was just wanting to know what he was but it was something it had to have been something I think he was wanting to make sure no one was around me that I wasn't you know you wanted to just kind that make sure everything was okay that's why I kept calling you know just asked different questions honestly he was probably even sleeping in different questions to see if I would have been the right candidate for him because he was done to kill me he could not wait any wanted me to be calm about it and just accept it and calm down and just deal with it it was insane did have you looked into obviously they were there that they were the women that were on the Post-it note and they were all found to be safe have you heard about any of the other cases that he might be connected to particular the ones in Las Vegas a couple of few people have read my letters because I guess he had contacted this lady's sister and she let them eat in one night and never came back and play sir no one would help her or believer or serious because she I guess she's serious and she was so much and it broke my heart and then another a couple other letters from people that heat they knew that he had their friend or their family someone in her family had met him because well they just knew I guess somehow they'd went through her phone or something but I knew that she had met him and that think she never came back but no one would help us because of the situation that was really so sad do you think you could forward those letters to and we can help them I can try to the you know that's one of them that's the main focus of this is trying to use the power of the crowd out there to to see and connect you know this guy to murders that are unsolved missing women that are on sale because it definitely seems like but like you said he had done this before so late before I mean there's no doubt in my mind that I bet money he's probably done there since he was old enough you know about he has probably got no sense in her high school or right after I mean you could tell you could just tell like so what have you been up to I don't know I haven't really done much of talking to someone about everything which I think I need to it's been like going on for years and I feel like it's getting kind of works with me I've been okay I'm working and just trying to at first I couldn't even go to Kroger's or go shopping at the grocery store anything for like I just come around no one and then but now I'm doing a lot better I'm around my friends sometimes and I work and I just made think I might need to talk to somebody I'm just having really bad nightmares sometimes periodically the other two are you still in touch with Detective Cooper cell phone number I haven't talked to him in about a year or so but yeah we're still friends resources for you that they can provide you are a victim you need to go in and you need to get some help and talk this out, because this is this is serious you went through a very traumatic event to this is serious stuff that you experienced he attack you you you are you are a hero in this but you are a victim as well and our resources for you to get you help so promise me that you will go and at least either call detective Cooper or reach out to your DA's office and try to get some help because you don't want to look at you you don't want to take this on for yourself for the rest of your life by like I didn't take it I'm not take a ride I didn't take it on like a serious as it as it really is I'm just kind of just trying to be just and just trying to go on but I haven't really like gotten any help for myself and it really is starting to come I can tell you I mean I can tell that I definitely should have done that you're still having obviously it no matter who you are this is not a matter of being tough this is a matter of now realizing the trauma that you have so just just make sure you do that ok Heather I'm sure they will help you but if something goes wrong and they don't help you got reach out to us will get somebody for you and you know the one thing I always say about True Crime as a genre is that there are a thousand supervillains and so few known superheroes do you know you truly are a hero because you took down either am a serial killer in the making or an actual serial killer you took him down he was going to definitely hurt. are people so either you save lives there's no question about it thank you guys so we will definitely be in touch and we'll also when this when this episode comes out we all will share with you any other information that we find out about maybe other cases that he might be involved in but I think the number one thing I definitely and send us over that information from those hang out or other survivors are reaching out and then we'll we'll get some answers, do you feel about this perpetrator this Neal Falls has he done it before you listen to Heather Yeo what what really struck me is she's talking about Falls getting out of his car and yet there's two other people that are right there and he is so Tunnel Vision on her that if heat seism it's not scaring him away he's not altering his behavior he is now locked in he is going to proceed with what he wants to do he has been what is Heather say 7 hours communicating with her he's been fantasizing about this very moment he sees her he is out of his car and he is going straight at her and is not paying any attention to the environment at all he's just now going that to me is very significant that is a potion that is showing that he is now he's now getting to that point internally where no matter what happens he's got carry out of the ACT he's past the point of self-preservation at this point and also you know we talked about signifiers we have the guy's picture we're going to see in this hole idea this episode is to see if these four women who are where were murdered or went missing in Vegas if he might be related to that we'll talk about that in a second but also any other victims this guy might have had and he's showing some identifiers in his behavior before hand in this day and age in 2015 you don't get lost everybody has a cell phone everybody has GPS you have Maps you don't get lost I think this was you know Heather was talking about how she wanted to make sure that she was alone I think this was also part of his process I think he was he was getting off on talking to her over and over again, that's another identifier for him as anybody ever been on a date with a guy. With the person that was like that that was constantly doing that you know over 7 hours that it took him because he wasn't in this car driving around for 7 hours he was calling her to kind of ran himself up in Subway and that's possible he's just kind of getting to know the prices of grasses out of that neighborhood while he's communicating with her part of that communication maybe just his assurances that she still where she supposed to be versus moving on so as he's kind of circling around and getting closer and closer he's he's paying attention to the neighborhood he's paying attention to patrol please paying attention who's out and about but he's also wanted to keep track of where she's at and he's taking his time over the course of seven hours so that showing of patients and that's also a sign of intelligence because he's able to kind of hold off I'm a compulsion until he sees her and then that's when the tunnel vision kicks in police didn't just have Heather's account of the encounter The Man forty-five-year-old Neil Falls at four pairs of handcuffs in a gun on his person when they went to his vehicle they found even more troubling items that could only be described as a kill kid falls at axes a machete shovel Sledgehammer plastic trash bags and plastic containers large enough to fit a body prepared prepared in order for body disposal and body dismemberment sledgehammer that's really you're trying to pulverize pieces bone in order to break it into smaller parts bleach get rid of the plastic trash bags of course is to be able to be able to get to the body parts or the body itself to a location put it into maybe a car without you know if he has multiple bulletproof vests where is he acquiring those from because those aren't necessarily readily available to the average person and what is he expecting you know why is he needing a bulletproof vest yeah you have to think of whether he thought he was going to count go out he was going to go on this may be on a rampage and then and have it out with the police and going to be confronted with that he's expecting one of them to pull a they shoot him in the chest you always got a vest on but the most disturbing items found in his pocket he had to post it was six names and phone numbers authorities weren't sure these were names of past or potential victims with due diligence they were able to track down all six women falls down through Backpage they were all safe but they had to tell them they told them their names were on a potential serial killers Hit List It stands to reason that Heather's actions saved their lives and was quoted as saying it is likely mr. Falls is a serial killer I believe that she has an Heather save some other Families 2 if she didn't fight back she most certainly would be dead in the authorities cannot interrogate a dead man but they begin to look into his background they saw him and stopped by police numerous times in his life in more than 20 States this guy move around a lot and he had also once live in Eugene Oregon again Oregon which is a breeding ground for serial killers the fact that for a 8 years he works security at the Hoover Dam which is just 45 minutes from Las Vegas and he rented a room in Henderson Nevada to just minutes from Vegas those eight years that he was in Vegas 2002-2008 when all four of the women we talked about in the beginning of the episode went missing or were murdered it was this information that made you his mom hopeful that she would find answers finally and Pamela is actually able to join us today about Jody's case what was Jodi like and she loved me so much and she made me so happy she was a good person and her plans if you guys worked in the casino industry but she wanted to what they open up a beauty shop right near Jodi was going to beauty school and then her Grant was taken away from our around the time that she that she can sex work there's a girl that I worked with her nephew I kind of stopped my daughter at the high school and interested in section great things to go with it in Vegas downtown you see a lot. Sure this is not the case of that we get sometimes with like a small town girl goes to the big city and then something that she said she was around all of this this stuff and also she had a try to warn her of the dangers and what did you tell her when you initially found out about the dangers of his work I screamed I was in shock she was she was always very intelligent and she was at the gifted an academically talented program at school so I was real surprised and just accept it but once you understood the situation she's going to do this she's her own person did you discuss with her the dangers of being a sex worker I had a breakdown my husband was dying at the time you're dealing with Jodi's life decisions you have a lot going on and in with her we moved in together and we're so sorry to hear about it and what were your you know how do I notified them attract we were we were staying together because I couldn't stay with my husband anymore we got together and we went out for the night and never came home and then you call the police the next day I went and put in a missing persons report and it seemed like and I know a little bit about your story your your everything kind of smiled after that in your life I don't know how it could have gotten any worse missing I believe your husband passed away right and then put in a report two weeks after I had posted pictures of her picture all around that area to see if anybody coming from from or she came in and she said that she had read a newspaper article that's when I knew to find out absolutely homicide detectives came into the casino to talk to me so you know once once you know Jody is is found in our torso is found where you starting to think about you know where she possibly could have interacted with the person that did this to her what she picking somebody up off the street was this through some sort of advertisement to advertising agency by the Harbor View Apartments sure he would know more than I know I'm just saying about what what's going on you know whoever killed her surgical saw with Precision to remove her arms and license in her head you know it wouldn't just thought it would be somebody that knew how do you like that this happened here to certain stories about victims that might have been disposed of in a similar fashion were you sending these to the investigator saying this this could be connected not for a long time I lost my mind for a few years there I was homeless and I lost my union job so I asked I didn't know anything I couldn't tell you what my name was at the time which is understandable when when do you become aware of this Neal Falls I was working at a at a motel here in town where I live in Klamath Falls and I was going into breakfast for the traveler and I went in and turn the TV on that was a big train showed all the states that they thought he'd tell them because that was what I did with anything that has to do with anything I got fired from work that day which was a blessing and I went home and my my youngest daughter said did you see she showed me her phone in a picture wow so true when she went right there and her father and me so she still had the desire to reach out with the media to look for a cistern way cuz obviously I guess some of the journalists trying to see in a potentially because of what was found in his car he had a lot of the he had to kill camp in his car he has yours in Vegas Living in Henderson working at the dam and when you looked into his background MyChart story was him no question about it I had well I didn't have any question about it until recently. One of the guys she went to high school with this guy one of her best friend sent me an article about confessed to killing my daughter another friend and I don't know and I don't know and just put in jail for prostituting a 14 year old girl with methamphetamine taking the money I don't know really crazy and I don't know from Las Vegas authorities in terms of for the status of Jodi's case and where they can Bernardino County Las Vegas was never a factor and I spoke with him is his stance on this is something that he feels that is responsible for investigating about Neil and I always wanted him to know my phone number so that in case something and then you got to realize there is this some San Bernardino County sheriff's office San Bernardino County High School in San Bernardino and interviewed this just the real they don't tell me a lot so they were following a couple different leash and I gave them the story about the guy and I don't know what they can come up when I talk to him or if they're not sure they don't want to say which is what I heard I did never heard anything so I don't know who knows what the FBI got involved in the case Paul probably because of interstate interstate right have you talked with the families of Misty Lindsey or Jesse and where are those cases at that have those guys got any closer to anything and the girl and her mom and you started working with an organization I work with a lot of parents of murdered children I like to write and it helps me get it off my chest and it helps me teenagers that I spoke with my little problem but they're little problem you know and drug addicted to getting a full-time job and my grandson is with me and my daughter and and we're very happy here and I'm very happy that's great and we're definitely going to keep on trying to get answers for you and thank you so much for talking with us today once again we have rules on the murder Squad if you're going to work on these investigations with us know naming names in public as we don't want you to do that send the information to us we will throw it over to the authorities to each other and be safe so now it's time for the weekly distraction I've got to the first day is is that my mother finally figured out how to listen to the podcast on my mom and she was very happy with her birthday episode from last month South happy me happy and also this is my real traction because I'm having a dilemma here there is a craft Merino squadrito crafter called the cuddle cult and she has made Karen and Georgia Peddler kind of like pillows or cuddle pillows type of thing in the past and she's going to make one of us and she were just wrote saying hello so I'm about to start these murders by pieces of you and holes for the first time and I want to ask a question I usually have each person holding something that reflects then is there something you would want to hold what about Paul also quotes in the back of my pieces it'll be fun if you could tell me what you would both like to say I'm excited to make these for you guys I love the podcast enjoyed your book thanks so much Karen holding well George was holding Elvis and Karen was holding me so I'm very pleased by okay.

Squad Trinity walk in the door he was like I said how are you doing and he was like I'm fine and then soon as I turn my head he was right up against me with a gun in my face that he said live or die and I said what I need to live or die and he smiled and then I was like oh no no no no no I said you can't do this much my friends are outside it was like and I just be quiet now they're not and I took off running straight to my back door and he was right behind me I hit off today but he lost the right behind me and then he grabbed my throat cuz I was starting to scream for my buddy and he grabs hold of my throat and squeezed and he didn't let go to the whole time he said I'm going to prison for a long time there's no doubt about that it's your decision whether it'll be 4 murder or rape and murder and I was like what I guess that's what he has on maybe he had let other females before make the choice whether he would write them after he killed them or just kill them and I cried like this can't happen this can't happen this isn't happening and I just started fighting country in many cases when were taken from their home towns across state lines before their bodies were disposed nothing seemed to connect the cases that is until a heroic woman falling off her attacker and killed him with his own gun in Charleston West Virginia when police looked in the attackers vehicle they discovered a sledgehammer cleaning fluids guns knives a shuttle handcuffs in a bulletproof vest otherwise known as a kill kit woman was only trying to save her life but when police arrived on scene it became clear she may have saved many others aside from the kill kit they also found a Post-It note with the names ages and phone numbers of C other women authorities believe he may have already been a serial killer or at least a serial killer in the making the families of the missing and murdered women across the country were hoping the answers our job get those answers this is the murder Squad

Voldemort's Arie spoiler alert Potter and the cold in the Harry Potter books and the cool thing about this diary is that it comes with invisible ink and then you write an invisible ink in there that

to use this for other means for good I'm going to use the is that right there for good was going to say it really suck though if you lost that wand and I wouldn't be I doubt I can write the Next Great American novel in here and if I lose the one I'm down here done absolutely is matcha okay now let's go to Vegas 2003 on March 6th 2003 two bikers or find a torso in black plastic bags bed sheets was just outside of Las Vegas on All State Route 159 on a road that led to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation area until they match the blonde woman Mystery Science March 2003 five months later on the 9th of August 14th to go out on a date appearance in the casino industry from the time he was young she told her mother Pam how she want to open your own beauty salon with those drinks stalled when she dropped out of high school sex work around the Edge of Seventeen when he first found out she freaked and kicked out of the house but after she turned eighteen Jody move back in with her mother and her sister on Jones Boulevard offer to help Jody out of the sex worker industry but Jodi like that she liked the amount of money that she was making and that you could make in the short amount of time so Cal remembered seeing Jody before she went out on the night of August 14th she said her newly dyed blonde hair look like a Halo Jody told her mom she loved her and Hannah said she would see her tomorrow Jodi was dropped off at the Harbor Island Club Apartments on East Harmon Avenue when is said they saw Jodi get into a white car with California license plates but Jodi never came home her mother Pamela reporter Jodi missing the next day was recovered in San Bernardino County California 25 miles South of the california-nevada Border authorities were able to identify it as Jodi Brewer by matching her tattoos hummingbird above her left breast and an M design on her lower back so we have these two cases now both torsos we don't know if they're connected or not but what does this mean this dismemberment what does it mean for this type of offender anytime you see somebody who's taking the oath of the step the steps to dismember a body yeah this this is not your average person I mean it's it takes a special person to take the effort to cut a body up they have to have that kind of that mental fortitude in order to put themselves through that and I seen cases where they do it once and they don't do it again it's not their thing that can I get grossed out but if they're doing it more than once then they recognize that that is going to be kind of self-preservation aspects discussed that they may be experiencing while they do it years later York show me the Henderson Nevada 2 years prior to going missing after me shut off with a hip-hop concert in New York so she moves across the country and she she she got a job in the area but you didn't tell them that she also got involved in history on May 4th 2005 from Lindsey later that day Lindsay was seen on surveillance in a Bank of America ATM depositing money she constantly checked in with them but after that call the text stop coming in and he knew something was wrong he called her parents tell him to report a missing and hopped on a plane back to Nevada from Syracuse I seen going north on Las Vegas Boulevard between 5 a.m. in the Luxor parking lot they also located a rental car that was in her name a block from Henderson home law enforcement immediately began looking into Lindsay's boyfriend despite the fact that he was across the country meanwhile 1600 miles away near Springfield Illinois three boys out riding ATVs came across with the first thought were props but as it got closer it became clear they were looking at real human legs when you talk about my grandma before somebody dismembering a body with a big body dismemberment case that we think of is the Black Dahlia case the the strange thing about that is because I wasn't doing it for preservation dissected the body and put a bisector the body and put it right out there for everybody to see what body parts are different places but now we've got somebody that's in Vegas going from Vegas 600 miles away that's the first big one in terms of try not to hide your tracks in the second one is quite possibly is putting body parts all across the strip so you know where's the rest of her that's obvious obvious tool marks indicating its dismemberment versus what's a animal activity then you got to start thinking okay I've got other body parts somewhere typically if it's a local guy killing a local victim District was in Las Vegas 1600 miles away so you could be scattered Across the Nation in the legs didn't have signs of decomp the nails were painted and a tattoo is still intact but it would take three years before DNA would be matched to that of Lindsay but while Lindsey's family waiting for answers yet another family would just start their search in April 2005 a blond hazel-eyed young woman left her home and ended up in Nevada Jessica Jesse Foster been a man in Canada where she was from the man invited her to travel with him to Atlantic City Atlantic City they went to Las Vegas was supposed to be a short trip but Jesse kept making excuses to not come home it was during this trip that our family believe she became sex trafficked once a man that was Peter Todd she's moving in with him and then they became engaged after Jesse became involved with Todd she was arrested twice on charges relating to sex work in June and September of 2005 after the first arrest according to hospital records Todd beer breaking her jaw before she disappeared she took a trip home for the holidays in 2005 but left right after opening presents on Christmas morning they still stayed in contact by phone but that would stop just a few short months later on March 28th 2006. She's family heard from her for the last time that Jesse left him on April 3rd he came to the house while she was supposed to be except her makeup and hair dryer or gone along with Jesse her family said those were items that Jesse would never leave behind though but perhaps the strange side of Left Behind and Untouched by Jesse was a $20,000 in her bank account from a car accident settlement it was money their family says she was going to use to go to school Jesse hasn't been seen since I use a credit card or her phone since March 28th 2006 could be a serial killer long-haul trucker hunting in Las Vegas and the fact that the legs of Lindsey Harris are found 1600 miles away pointed to a killer who is Barry mobile as this is all unfolding medalist from the Oklahoma Bureau Investigation was spotting a pattern not necessarily from Vegas but close to where she was she was seeing all these bodies deposited along Interstate 40 and this was the starting point for the FBI's Highway serial killings initiative database victims found near the interstate now that number is up to 700 to truckers and we do know that they're certainly have been trucker serial killers before they are typically picking up women at a speed truck stops in a lot of the truck stops have clamped down on that but you pick up a woman from one location you potentially kill them in your in your truck turn to another location nobody is looking for them for a while and she might be a Jane Doe in the other location it seems like this with the FBI has is that this is more of a Perfect Crime than most because it is so mobile and because we know that our as we talked about before our law enforcement doesn't really talk to each other as much as they should especially when you start getting you know it's one thing within a state from County to County you know in terms of law enforcement communicating that kind of move into another County you might not see that communication efficient as if it were within the same state to state bordering states have different systems that don't communicate how do you spell communicate questions about trying to start an unsolved murders database and I was working on it with some guys were going to pull information basically scrape information from across the web and there were certain websites that had stuff together Ohio I remember had a database of 5000 is 220000 is like well let's just a drop in the bucket the information is scattered it's everywhere and nobody has you know what we're getting there with name s we're getting there with these other places but as far as outside murders in one place that we would like to be able to use like we're talking about with last episode of searching for victims that might have been you know found outside females with their pants that have been sexually assaulted just put those terms into a search engine and have everything spit back at you is supposed to do that in terms of have a question are passing investigator you fill out detailed information about your case it gets put into the program that was started when we fill out that question are there if they do that either don't do it as thoroughly as it should be or they don't have the expertise to be able to fill out the details that would be able to be actively search the database to keep what I think should happen is all of these journalists that have gotten ahead of new jobs well as the newspaper apartment rent have them every time they pick up a couple bottles of vodka that could happen if anything is going to be seen But the skill set is out there and these detectives are so overworked. We seen Cold Case departments start and then just dry up 2 weeks to months later or because there's not that immediate satisfy ministration comes out there is out there it's just a you know it's one extra line item in a budget that can make this happen to order Squad there is a there's a fantasy aspect there is no behavioral aspect and usually now but you're you're looking for somebody who's been trained into offender behaviors looking for those signature elements that's will stand out and that's where I seen some of these vicap question are some of the significant behaviors that these offenders are what these vendors are doing that are somewhat unique to them that would then be able to be searched they were standardized pull out a few words but it's this offender likes to this is liking to use to strangle and once we should allow them to come back alive and play that God that's a significant Defender and many investigators aren't looking at that aspect that they can see evidence of that within the crime scene itself in the autopsy itself and not just for unsolved murders but also potentially for sexual assault that he might have done that before sexual assault and that's how to identify him and then he graduates to murder potentially and liking all those together and that's where we end up here in July 2015 Heather salt made a date man off of backpage.com sex worker she gave the man her address the man arrived at our home and the woman immediately knew something was wrong he walked in and immediately asked her live or die the date ended with this 911 call right now where is the guy at do you know who the guy is she said no deliver. All right I'm not sure what kind of weapon did he play with his gun is in a white male and black male you know what color clothing just remember what color shirt and she left a male standing in the kitchen what is your name sweetie okay okay is she bleeding from where she looks like she has medicine marks around her neck and she does have a little bit of blood out light scratches on her fingers was she able to enter him in any way. Tell us that I know it's a story that you told a bunch of times but initially come in contact with false down to take me out just a missile and they sleep just introduced ourselves more than anything at first but as soon as I don't know something was funny about the whole situation but I was I don't know just a busy day I was just really in a rush. I didn't pay much attention to all the little things that I should have now that I think back you know but we were supposed to just meet get to know each other that day and but it took him like 7 hours to finally get to my house he kept calling back so I didn't know what was going there was he saying and calling me from different location and Charleston and I was like if he calls back again he's saying that he's not coming he's just he's finally showed up and he was standing out in the driveway he pulled in down the road in front of me and drove all the way down to the very end of the road and came back and then pulled in my driveway had I known what he was doing he was probably there trying to find a way make sure you can get away out and make sure there was no you know please sir I don't know you know what I know he was just looking for us in case before you even pulled in but I didn't know that fan when he first got there but he was in such like a rush it was speed walking to get in the car to get in my house and I don't even think you say no I don't know but across the street to get some soda and and then soon as I turn my head he was right up against me with a gun in my side he said liver died and I said what and he said liver guy and he smiled and then I was like oh no no no no no my friends are outside it was like you know just be quiet mother or not I took off running straight to my back door and he was right behind me I hit it right behind me and then he grabbed my throat my throat and squeezed and he didn't let go the whole time I didn't get any are the whole time it was horrible it was a fight after that standing up or are you guys on the ground was going on we were standing up and he was like because I kept trying to scream my buddy's name the whole time but he would not let go I thought for just a second he was going to keep me quiet but I think he was going to kill me right then and there and couldn't wait to get inside and he can't wait to anyone me to be calm about it it was like calm down just calm down you know let me tell you what I tell you and I was like oh Lordy don't don't I'm going to prison for a long time there's no doubt about that he said it's your decision whether it'll be for murder or rape and murder and I was like what I guess that's what he had or maybe he had let other females before make the choice whether he would write them after he killed did you say anything I just just I'm kind of just a kind of cried like this can be like if he hadn't shot me yet he wasn't going to shoot me there he was dressed to the party until he had that done this before he was maneuvering me perfect hand me down and no time and I took a breath for so long I was like please please please let me breathe and by this by this point I was in the floor like grabbing for anything and he had even his clothes were soaked in skin tight I couldn't even get a hold of anything I couldn't call nothing well the night before that for some reason brought in a little tiny right from outside and I guess I catch a wow well when I was in the store and he was pretty much and he shut the gun down under the kitchen table but not and he said the kitchen table and he was like I was so weak I probably couldn't have done anything when he pulled me up by my throat say it again lay in bed and I just I had took a breath and so long I don't even think about anything I grabbed it and just reached and then I can finally breathe but I was out here for a long time but I can finally breathe and it was finally over so I was in such it was so bad wow how to say that in so they did the beep was the ring in your ears I guess from his belt. Hung on the back door knob and he was hanging off of the back door he had his arm on the kitchen counter but he was just hang in there and yeah it was even worse because I didn't know what to do and I had to literally move my recliner in front of the front door that's how bad we was fighting inside there that I had to literally move furniture to get outside of my house that's how bad he was throwing me all over the house but when you shot out immediately drop and stop what he was doing to you I was scared that he was either almost like almost a I just know that run and I turned and I seen him and I know he was dead like it was instant I guess yeah I don't know he might have found this picture self back up for a second because we wasn't as close to the back door when I had shot him but we were getting towards the back door he was trying to pull me out and yeah he ended up his belt was hanging off of the back door knob when the police found him getting in shape isn't just about losing weight it's about feeling better about yourself whether that means having more energy to keep up with your busy life fitting into those goal jeans being more in tune with your body's needs are practicing better self-care Noom is a habit changing solution that helps users develop a new relationship with food through personalized choices with Noom no food is good bad or off-limits instead noon teaches moderation by helping you to track meal habits visualize portion sizes and see calorie density at a glance it can even be used in conjunction with many pre-existing popular diets I know my specific goal I always want to be trying to stay lean but also maintain a certain level of muscle mass for my fitness and with new mile be able to see macros in that the level of protein that I'm taking in order to make sure that I'm ensuring that I'm taking in the nutrients I need to meet my fitness goals you don't have to change everything all in one day small steps make big progress sign up for your trial today at noon Noom.

I'm just been blown away by the strength of the resilience that you you showed to be able to get away from this guy I eat I think it's important to understand his approach to you he gets there and he is approaching you he's all East tunnel vision but when he is talking to you on the phone how is he on the phone what is he saying why are you all the way over here I don't know if he was just wanting to know what he was but it was something it had to have been something I think he was wanting to make sure no one was around me that I wasn't you know you wanted to just kind that make sure everything was okay that's why I kept calling you know just asked different questions honestly he was probably even sleeping in different questions to see if I would have been the right candidate for him because he was done to kill me he could not wait any wanted me to be calm about it and just accept it and calm down and just deal with it it was insane did have you looked into obviously they were there that they were the women that were on the Post-it note and they were all found to be safe have you heard about any of the other cases that he might be connected to particular the ones in Las Vegas a couple of few people have read my letters because I guess he had contacted this lady's sister and she let them eat in one night and never came back and play sir no one would help her or believer or serious because she I guess she's serious and she was so much and it broke my heart and then another a couple other letters from people that heat they knew that he had their friend or their family someone in her family had met him because well they just knew I guess somehow they'd went through her phone or something but I knew that she had met him and that think she never came back but no one would help us because of the situation that was really so sad do you think you could forward those letters to and we can help them I can try to the you know that's one of them that's the main focus of this is trying to use the power of the crowd out there to to see and connect you know this guy to murders that are unsolved missing women that are on sale because it definitely seems like but like you said he had done this before so late before I mean there's no doubt in my mind that I bet money he's probably done there since he was old enough you know about he has probably got no sense in her high school or right after I mean you could tell you could just tell like so what have you been up to I don't know I haven't really done much of talking to someone about everything which I think I need to it's been like going on for years and I feel like it's getting kind of works with me I've been okay I'm working and just trying to at first I couldn't even go to Kroger's or go shopping at the grocery store anything for like I just come around no one and then but now I'm doing a lot better I'm around my friends sometimes and I work and I just made think I might need to talk to somebody I'm just

like gotten any help for myself and it really is starting to come I can tell you I mean I can tell that I definitely should have done that you're still having obviously it no matter who you are this is not a matter of being tough this is a matter of now realizing the trauma that you have so just just make sure you do that ok Heather I'm sure they will help you but if something goes wrong and they don't help you got reach out to us will get somebody for you and you know the one thing I always say about True Crime as a genre is that there are a thousand supervillains and so few known superheroes do you know you truly are a hero because you took down either am a serial killer in the making or an actual serial killer you took him down he was going to definitely hurt. are people so either you save lives there's no question about it thank you guys so we will definitely be in touch and we'll also when this when this episode comes out we all will share with you any other information that we find out about maybe other cases that he might be involved in but I think the number one thing I definitely and send us over that information from those hang out or other survivors are reaching out and then we'll we'll get some answers, do you feel about this perpetrator this Neal Falls has he done it before you listen to Heather Yeo what what really struck me is she's talking about Falls getting out of his car and yet there's two other people that are right there and he is so Tunnel Vision on her that if heat seism it's not scaring him away he's not altering his behavior he is now locked in he is going to proceed with what he wants to do he has been what is Heather say 7 hours communicating with her he's been fantasizing about this very moment he sees her he is out of his car and he is going straight at her and is not paying any attention to the environment at all he's just now going that to me is very significant that is a potion that is showing that he is now he's now getting to that point internally where no matter what happens he's got carry out of the ACT he's past the point of self-preservation at this point and also you know we talked about signifiers we have the guy's picture we're going to see in this hole idea this episode is to see if these four women who are where were murdered or went missing in Vegas if he might be related to that we'll talk about that in a second but also any other victims this guy might have had and he's showing some identifiers in his behavior before hand in this day and age in 2015 you don't get lost everybody has a cell phone everybody has GPS you have Maps you don't get lost I think this was you know Heather was talking about how she wanted to make sure that she was alone I think this was also part of his process I think he was he was getting off on talking to her over and over again, that's another identifier for him as anybody ever been on a date with a guy. With the person that was like that that was constantly doing that you know over 7 hours that it took him because he wasn't in this car driving around for 7 hours he was calling her to kind of ran himself up in Subway and that's possible he's just kind of getting to know the prices of grasses out of that neighborhood while he's communicating with her part of that communication maybe just his assurances that she still where she supposed to be versus moving on so as he's kind of circling around and getting closer and closer he's he's paying attention to the neighborhood he's paying attention to patrol please paying attention who's out and about but he's also wanted to keep track of where she's at and he's taking his time over the course of seven hours so that showing of patients and that's also a sign of intelligence because he's able to kind of hold off I'm a compulsion until he sees her and then that's when the tunnel vision kicks in police didn't just have Heather's account of the encounter The Man forty-five-year-old Neil Falls at four pairs of handcuffs in a gun on his person when they went to his vehicle they found even more troubling items that could only be described as a kill kid falls at axes a machete shovel Sledgehammer plastic trash bags and plastic containers large enough to fit a body prepared prepared in order for body disposal and body dismemberment sledgehammer that's really you're trying to pulverize pieces bone in order to break it into smaller parts bleach get rid of the plastic trash bags of course is to be able to be able to get to the body parts or the body itself to a location put it into maybe a car without you know if he has multiple bulletproof vests where is he acquiring those from because those aren't necessarily readily available to the average person and what is he expecting you know why is he needing a bulletproof vest yeah you have to think of whether he thought he was going to count go out he was going to go on this may be on a rampage and then and have it out with the police and going to be confronted with that he's expecting one of them to pull a they shoot him in the chest you always got a vest on but the most disturbing items found in his pocket he had to post it was six names and phone numbers authorities weren't sure these were names of past or potential victims with due diligence they were able to track down all six women falls down through Backpage they were all safe but they had to tell them they told them their names were on a potential serial killers Hit List It stands to reason that Heather's actions saved their lives and was quoted as saying it is likely mr. Falls is a serial killer I believe that she has an Heather save some other Families 2 if she didn't fight back she most certainly would be dead in the authorities cannot interrogate a dead man but they begin to look into his background they saw him and stopped by police numerous times in his life in more than 20 States this guy move around a lot and he had also once live in Eugene Oregon again Oregon which is a breeding ground for serial killers the fact that for a 8 years he works security at the Hoover Dam which is just 45 minutes from Las Vegas and he rented a room in Henderson Nevada to just minutes from Vegas those eight years that he was in Vegas 2002-2008 when all four of the women we talked about in the beginning of the episode went missing or were murdered it was this information that made you his mom hopeful that she would find answers finally and Pamela is actually able to join us today about Jody's case what was Jodi like and she loved me so much and she made me so happy she was a good person and her plans if you guys worked in the casino industry but she wanted to what they open up a beauty shop right near Jodi was going to beauty school and then her Grant was taken away from our around the time that she that she can sex work there's a girl that I worked with her nephew I kind of stopped my daughter at the high school and interested in section great things to go with it in Vegas downtown you see a lot. Sure this is not the case of that we get sometimes with like a small town girl goes to the big city and then something that she said she was around all of this this stuff and also she had a try to warn her of the dangers and what did you tell her when you initially found out about the dangers of his work I screamed I was in shock she was she was always very intelligent and she was at the gifted an academically talented program at school so I was real surprised and just accept it but once you understood the situation she's going to do this she's her own person did you discuss with her the dangers of being a sex worker I had a breakdown my husband was dying at the time you're dealing with Jodi's life decisions you have a lot going on and in with her we moved in together and we're so sorry to hear about it and what were your you know how do I notified them attract we were we were staying together because I couldn't stay with my husband anymore we got together and we went out for the night and never came home and then you call the police the next day I went and put in a missing persons report and it seemed like and I know a little bit about your story your your everything kind of smiled after that in your life I don't know how it could have gotten any worse missing I believe your husband passed away right and then put in a report two weeks after I had posted pictures of her picture all around that area to see if anybody coming from from or she came in and she said that she had read a newspaper article that's when I knew to find out absolutely homicide detectives came into the casino to talk to me so you know once once you know Jody is is found in our torso is found where you starting to think about you know where she possibly could have interacted with the person that did this to her what she picking somebody up off the street was this through some sort of advertisement to advertising agency by the Harbor View Apartments sure he would know more than I know I'm just saying about what what's going on you know whoever killed her surgical saw with Precision to remove her arms and license in her head you know it wouldn't just thought it would be somebody that knew how do you like that this happened here to certain stories about victims that might have been disposed of in a similar fashion were you sending these to the investigator saying this this could be connected not for a long time I lost my mind for a few years there I was homeless and I lost my union job so I asked I didn't know anything I couldn't tell you what my name was at the time which is understandable when when do you become aware of this Neal Falls I was working at a at a motel here in town where I live in Klamath Falls and I was going into breakfast for the traveler and I went in and turn the TV on that was a big train showed all the states that they thought he'd tell them because that was what I did with anything that has to do with anything I got fired from work that day which was a blessing and I went home and my my youngest daughter said did you see she showed me her phone in a picture wow so true when she went right there and her father and me so she still had the desire to reach out with the media to look for a cistern way cuz obviously I guess some of the journalists trying to see in a potentially because of what was found in his car he had a lot of the he had to kill camp in his car he has yours in Vegas Living in Henderson working at the dam and when you looked into his background MyChart story was him no question about it I had well I didn't have any question about it until recently.
