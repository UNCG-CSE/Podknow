kid is he wants to be a journalist at 11 this kid knows exactly who he wants to be in life what he wants to be and he's not waiting till he's growing up to do it he's starting to do anything with the disposition and voice of a news reporter interview with Elizabeth WarrenBeth Warren and that's how we came to see him cuz that that sort of went a little viral so we booked him for our show thinking it would be fun but we had no idea how much fun it was going I love this kid take a listen to him with Ellen sorry to hear you're a reporter you have to take it again oh my God listen at the big get having you here thank you so much thank you thank you you're so sweet all right so tell me how you decided cuz you love reporting right you do it all the time you don't take a break you report you bring stuff with you in case of story breaks out so when did you get interested in reporting all those things and it just really came together for me it came together in what way like what was the first thing that you decided to report on on the first thing I reported on was a basketball event that was happening at our local school and that was the first thing I covered I didn't really think it was going to be a good story and trust me it wasn't it was my first one how old were you then I was I believe it was 10 okay how we my first on video story okay so then now you are you covered like the parades and what else what in particular I covered in I still laugh about it till this day and it went story was that we were at our federal courthouse all the media was there and a week they found a powdery substance and the officer from the Toledo fire department came and briefed us and it was figured I'd get this guy's Sweet and Low it was sweet and low so I was back story definitely was one that I just continue to laugh laugh about to this guy sure how much Sweet'N Low was it that they Patek everybody I don't know they just found in the letter so it could be a bee and it can I say yeah okay well maybe somebody just needed Sweet and Low and send mail it to me and they forgot to put it in the package or something like that that was definitely an amazing experience I mean she gave me wrong with it answers which I love because I had only the chance Act 2 questions and I didn't want it to be a short interview to be informed so why she gave me good and answers that and I'm not going to say anything politically but she gave me the wrong answer is that I think we're good length so that point where the American people can have a thoroughly informed decision was just logging afterwards cuz I have to type all that down to make the story so sure the tears so excited on the gold standard and the vocabulary in the realizing how neutral he has to be politically what he

you've got so much going on to give you a hard time will never stop now I don't like I like tennis I watch the majors you know I watch Wimbledon I watch the French Open Australian Open the US Open that is the extent and Wimbledon that is the extent of my tennis now that sound like you're a huge tennis Band tour II I know past Wimbledon for 2 weeks before it's on a real Channel you got to go find a deep in your I don't do that that's near the top of my dial I watch but I have become so smitten with Naomi Osaka I just think she's adorable Naomi Osaka had the unfortunate position last year of being the person in the US Open tennis finals for women to play Serena Williams who was about to win the tie if she won that match she would win the title of most wins US Open 2018 buy a US Woman by any woman tennis player but she take the title and Naomi Osaka who was I think of the time 20 years old beat Serena Williams and the booking everybody wanted was Serena Williams and Ellen texted us moments after that match ended in said I want Naomi Osaka and Naomi Osaka in winning she had crushed not only Serena Williams's hard but the heart of everyone in the stands and everyone watching and she understood sort of what a big deal that was and she was lovely and so cut to this year in the semi-finals of this year Naomi place this young Phenom cocoa and beats her and then insist that Coco be part of the post-game interview and heaps so much love and praise on Coco and Coco's family that once again Naomi Osaka is just the most gracious the most lovely tennis player on the tour goes so far beyond tennis like it is in these times right now when you're really looking for good examples for your kids this moment was something that I absolutely showed my kids right away and I know so many people were moved by a c Everett who is Ben who played the game for years and has been a commentator for years talked about this in such a moving way saying this was unlike anything she's ever seen in the sport of women's tennis or in sport before net it really is like a game changer and however I do any kind of like game or anything with Kevin I usually lose and what he does is he taunts me sure that makes fun of me and make me feel bad. What you need is Naomi Osaka to show people like heaven that you had two branches and what we did last year with Naomi Osaka with Michael B Jordan yes so she's like a little she was quiet last time sure meeting Ellen like you might be and admitted that she liked Michael B Jordan right so Ellen texted him instantly and embarrassed her so much that she was she was like when your mom tells like the boys have a crush on National Television en route and should I even respond I know she goes to them so well we could let her off the hook that easy he's not important and had a giant Banner of her and Michael be printed for the outside of our stage and Huntley. Take a listen to the two of them chatting on set end here and look at what happened I mean your life and you were so shy then I think you're still shy but you probably grown a whole lot this year right I would hope so I can talk to you more now cuz you even when I watch you interviewed when it cuz I watched all of the US Open I just I just love it and I watch that match when you be cocoa and it was really tough cuz people in Hershey's brand new and and she did so well at Wimbledon and everybody's like Coco Coco and then she plays you and you know it was just amazing how you handle that it was so beautiful and I texted right away and did you did you look at her like you know understanding is that why you did that like what that would have felt like for you, nation of everything and I know that a lot of people came and watch that much for her and I'm normally people don't watch the press conferences after so I wanted her to get the chance to address everybody that was really sweet of you I was watching when you who did you play after that who beat you what was her name what was your name when you were walking out being interviewed before you walk out they said what what are you going to do to change up your game and you said I don't really think about that actually I'm lying I didn't like it was so funny cuz you just caught yourself and you're so honest the way you speak is that something that that you feel like you're better it just kind of expressing exactly how you feel instead of just kind of being quiet I mean you just said I'm quiet now I mean I just I like just being straightforward and honest so yeah that usually gets me in a lot of trouble like with you you know you just did me dirty all I did was try to fulfill a fantasy of yours yes you said that Michael B Jordan was your crush so I reached out to him and then he texted and I think I put out there what he said and I mean he loves you and it was just unfortunate cuz he he didn't get back to me in time to while you were still here but but he really was a huge fan why why is that dirty so nicely I can't even say it what would you say if I said he's here now you guys are getting excited for no reason okay I would I would be calm cuz I'm accomplishing his dad and I think she's right but he's not here Ed jealous about Nick NCI my gosh this is a father-daughter Duo that was a joke you have to watch it TVs go to Ellentube it's there to find it because listening to it won't do it justice but tell us who they are well Nick is the father and Sienna is the daughter and they couldn't be cuter together and she's so I think three she's a baby the tiniest kid we've ever had on the show and he plays guitar and they sing the song seniorita by Camila Cabello it's so cute it almost hurts is that way I could describe it and so we talked to them and then we had them do it on the show and then we posted it and then give me like a bad yo I re-posted it and said can I sing this with you forever please and so are we trying to make that happen you bet we are yes we are that's all I want to take a listen to them singing But everyday is Jewel of Russia.
