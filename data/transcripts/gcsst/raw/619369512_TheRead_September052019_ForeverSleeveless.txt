happy birthday Beyonce yes every right

of my life
underrated not discussed enough Beyonce
about it you know I really can't even
tell what's underrated because I feel
like I don't really pay attention to
other people
opinions on Beyonce's music but yeah
everybody has their personal opinion I
mean people really don't even want to
give it to dangerously in love like it's
not incredible so oh that's an amazing
amazing amazing Bowser and every time I
hear it I think about the time that she
performed I want to say the Grammys in
that painting or whatever do you
remember where she was like performing
danger seeing love and she was literally
okay yes oh I have my god it was bad the
de-emphasis on danger bullshit that
bitch's life was it you guys well girls
welcome back to the read I am LaShawn
Daniels Wow
I was also about to be LaShawn Daniels
because waiting for a lot of reasons
yeah an iconic songwriter but also
because he has worked with Destiny's
Child right and has written so many
other songs like I knew he had had his
hands in everybody's stuff but to
actually like see all of the the stuff
that's come out ever since and people
are just like going through his his
greatest hits basically I was like my
god this man was really just like yeah
he ran my iPod for I wanna say most of
the time that I owned the iPod in school
oh yeah definitely for me like through
all of the mid to late 90s and then that
early 2000s era that a lot of us would
like to forget fashion was even into the
late 2000s yeah like a lot of bops of
the girls Berg yeah we're looking for so
it's unfortunate it really is less than
peace sir and blessings to the family
well let's move on to some black
excellence this week first and foremost
Cassandra B Jeter Bailey let me tell you
about her look Sandra is a native of
Cincinnati
that is an Ohio it is it's a place in
Ohio damn you can't since 90 she's also
a law school graduate
and first woman and first
african-american to serve as assistant
dean the University of Cincinnati's
College of Law Wow
and their school's admission and
financial aid department so Cassandra
found her passion for law after
participating in a pipeline ordering
rather participating in a pipeline
program called summer work experience in
law which was created by the Cincinnati
Bar Association and it was purpose was
to help increase the representation of
minorities in lost long she worked as
director of admissions for the JD and
graduate law programs at the Capitol
University Law School in Columbus Ohio
so she's all about you know advancing
the visibility and the strength and
support for people like a Thea in the
space of law in that school
I mean don't really have to look up
whenever this place was founded to
assume or guests pretty ancient
mmm-hmm firsts of anything is pretty sad
in 2019 much less woman and black but
the first woman period to be oh my god
appointment over the first woman and the
first african-american I think it would
be very clear on the two separate things
because it's just sever things nigga
founded in 1833 it can't be the fourth
oh the fourth oldest law school in the
u.s. it has to be black female it just
has to be it doesn't make any sense for
it not to be well congratulations to you
ma'am and all of the black girl magic
that you are suing also congratulations
speaking of black girl magic - Liz oh
I'm her number one I still you could
have been a bad bitch randomly I like to
frighten people on the street that's
usually a lot of fun every now and then
somebody recognizes what I'm talking
about
but well deserved talented sir
congratulations to you ma'am
why man great so they got to be great is
the eternal question of life
really
with that title yeah I mean absolutely
go into it give us more of yeah there's
expound upon that yeah man but yeah
that's a huge accomplishment and
honestly truth hurts is kind of old but
I'm just glad so many people are on to
Liz oh now that it came back in
circulation and everybody is like yes
bitch this song is it so congratulations
to her this amazing phenomenal this week
and hot tops how I met your bottom we've
got a couple of things to discuss
mostly mass so Dallas Austin was on
black TV
clearly no good came from - the biggest
headline that was taken away from his
moment with the beef Network I don't
know what else yeah we should go back to
that time anyways the topic of the boy
is mine iconic pop R&B; song yeah by
brandy and Monica Dallas Austin recounts
at a time where now he couldn't remember
if it was the AMAs or the VMAs I'm
surprised the Dallas Austin has any
recollection of the night needs to be
honest with vinegar his brain cells left
from back then astonished but he says
first he started with saying that they
never liked each other
he described Monica's ghetto he said it
was a mess he said if you didn't have
gold teeth she didn't like you feel like
he said it was a bad thing he was trying
to say that you know she was super
ghetto and brandi was super prim and
proper and so it was just you know a
disaster waiting to happen before they
even met want to know
and then he talks about the time before
their first performance of the boys
minds together at yes I'm assuming it's
I just saw the clip well I also did
watch the clip of them performing at the
VMAs and could not find the performance
of them performing at the AMAs together
doesn't my Dallas Austin so I'm assuming
that he meant VMAs just couldn't
remember because cocaine so he said that
he witnessed himself Monica haul off and
punch brandy punch brandy in the face
that make I didn't do anything so this
microphone right before they had to go
on and that because the song is
literally about their you know beef with
each other over a nigga right that the
audience was none the wiser now here's
the thing if they were talking about the
VMAs after I watched that clip it's
funny because a clip of them performing
it at the VMAs randomly popped up on
MTV's YouTube like two weeks ago maybe
so but they've been posting a lot of
random throwback VMA stuff as the actual
VMAs was going on they're trying to show
you a work show was actually interesting
one
look look so I think that's what that
was about but if that was the
performance that he was talking about
boy them heifers are some professional
Monica was just cheesing and smiling I
heard they were doing little koi looks
at one another like mine and like
looking all playful and stuff now Monica
may have been smiling simply because she
was gratified in the fact that she's
fish in the face but they both were
doing Brandis ability to go onstage and
sing with a bitch I'm not going here's
the thing though did it brandy and
Monica
already talked about this like I know
that brandy and Monica appeared on I
want to say it was the Breakfast Club
remember a couple years ago they were
like getting along I think they were
performing together for a while I don't
think all belongs to me
there you go so they were like promoting
that and I want to say they went on The
Breakfast Club and they talked about the
time that Monica literally punched her I
don't know they were referring to this
but this is not news okay I did I mean I
had heard rumors back then that they had
gotten into a physical fight they sat
down next to one another okay Monica
already talked about punching them and
punching her in the face and it sounded
like you know they were laughing about
it even though not too long after that
then Brandi was pissed again again
Monica acknowledged that Whitney Houston
was once kind II was going off on
everybody who's especially special
submits Norwood okay yeah well of course
the date I thought which it might be
also the album I try not to think of
Whitney Houston's death on that day but
how can you know how can you know yeah
exactly I thought about it every two
$0.11 yeah I don't think my brother
thinks about it he is the most dialed
out of pop culture person I have ever
met he's probably better on listen he
don't pay attention to shit they don't
have a Facebook Twitter he's a mailman
okay he put his headphones on he go
deliver the mail today I don't know you
know he definitely was prompted to
discuss this thing and I don't know how
anybody would talk about working with
brandy and Monica on the boys mind
without discussing the fact that they
don't like each other and did not like
each other that's common knowledge
everybody knows that now I don't think
he bigs nigga to talk about her getting
punched in the face but right okay know
you're there somebody gives you a moment
with a microphone and you're facing it
spicy people talk about so he probably
don't even think he was telling those
secret because it's like bitch everybody
knows this
it intentionally lousy he's gonna be
scandalous because again I don't think
this was news unless this was a separate
punch I'm quite certain I refuse to
believe brandy worked again with a bitch
who punched her more than one yeah one
time you fucking up and one time all
right
quiet enough but you want to fight me
you want to fight me that's enough of it
okay well alright now first I was like
where is this grown man you know
speaking on this business with these
girls from however long ago but I mean
he did also produce the song alright you
have go TP mouth Monica do you figure
out what that was supposed to be this is
a huge selling point for Monica
everybody nobody is loved by everyone
Rose Nylund had to come to grips with
the fact that someone didn't like her
yeah I mean mommy marsala time if they
talk about Jesus they'll talk about you
which was right and I kind of have
modified that to Beyonce but the point
remains like nobody is above criticism
or critique and Monica is quite
literally still friends with anyone with
a last name that's right you could be
the juiciest peach in the world it's
still somebody out there who don't like
peaches who's allergic who just don't
like the flavor whatever continue being
your peaches best that's what dreams of
the giant that's right you go out there
and you be a peach for the bitches who
like peaches so we're rolling out full
force with this rock nation NFL jay-z
thing the girls have a concert scheduled
for tomorrow meaning today if you're
listening to this on the day that it
comes out Satara v so here's the thing
the NFL rock nation inspire change is
the name of the movement the partnership
and such inspire change is their program
that is going to be the
the the the Negro ticket that we're
hoping for girls sell the plan as of now
mm-hmm
as I said today they have released they
will be having a free concert Chicago's
Grant Park featuring the likes of Meek
Mill raps od2 talented rap artist and
Meghan Trainor sure you know inclusion
not sure where that came from
let me tell you something I pulled up
the rock nation website to look for
Meghan Trainor I don't see her and I
don't I don't think she is but maybe you
know she just was like hi I felt so
connected to this oh no she's not epic
well alright then a lot about people who
are on because I just on my own accord
really wanted to get abreast with the
lineup here on the Roc Nation a lot of
these people I've now heard of before
they could be from all walks you know
they have a big Latin division some of
these people are managers and these
people work in publishing or whatever
but then there are artists that I didn't
know like Mariah's on here didn't know
about that even though I think I
probably heard and just forgot Jaden
Smith
Jay Electronica thought that was Rita
Ora it was low Luzi vert Mack wilds no
are Sandra Harry of course meek is going
to be there Miguel DJ mustard lots of
things they did have a lot I had no idea
they had this many artists okay so Roz
Vic Shakira
All Right girls well a lot of names I've
never heard before as well whose little
scars Oh willow and Jaden
Yo Gotti the the the rake it up
community is apart
my favorite Van Jones Miguel so yeah
Khalid
DJ Khaled they represent athletes as
well
yeah oh it's a whole separate they have
really expanded am baseball now boxes
Sokka let me stop because I'm actually
very annoyed roc nation finish it they
have a football and then they have a
soccer
no no soccer I know it is everywhere but
American footballs should just be called
soccer matter of fact lists are calling
football soccer American football yeah
you know people are going to be wildly
confused cool yeah so Rhapsody Meek Mill
Meghan Trainor performing they have us
it's called songs of the season this is
gonna be like an ongoing NFL musical
experience you can expect more of that
probably in other cities and I mean I
don't know much about Meghan Trainor I'm
trying to remember that song that she
became famous for hip no hip so much all
about that bass nope that's not the one
it is and she doesn't know yeah all
about the bass hips hips hips hips are
moving no no I know I've heard this on
Radio Disney or energy I know I'm not
lying okay let's not make a trailer I
mean it may be that it isn't Meghan
Trainor is it called its called hips
removal I bet Oh lose you she did that
which I'm lurch and that's a beautiful
song I've lit hips are and Google said
uneven it might be loops or moving okay
I know you lie cause your lips are
motherfucker shit goddamn look at you
I did an amazing job cuz I feel like I
got the melody you uh a few word lips
and hips are right there next to it
understandable elements aren't even that
far away from each other in alpha so the
point is I expect for her to do some pop
songs a poem I don't know and please
meek will probably talk about prison
reform into an acapella freestyle about
black empowerment and an advancement I
expect Rhapsody you probably do
something likewise maybe footage of
impoverished people in black and wide on
a screen yeah and poetry as I said
they're also selling apparel and smart
changed apparel and the funds from that
it will apparently go to putting out
more of these programs across the
country with proceeds that will benefit
education economic empowerment police
and community relations criminal justice
reform and more apparently also they
being rock nation in the NFL have
donated four hundred thousand dollars to
two different Chicago charities this
includes the better boys foundation
family and the Crushers Club okay the
better boys foundation provides
education employment and youth services
as well as family health programs to
more than four hundred families as it
says here on a wrap-up calm and the
Crushers Club mission is to help Chicago
kids restore their lives and improve
their neighborhood so getting in the
hoods and and introducing kids to Meek
Mill and Rhapsody and inspiring them to
leave the streets alone and combat the
white yeah um so look out for songs of
the season probably coming to a city
near you where lips will be moving girls
this it's still like I I don't feel I
feel like there are black people
involved in this who have nothing but
great intentions and I think that they
can probably
do and say some moving things as a part
of this has a whole the partnership to
me still feels like the NFL just said
here you niggas go have your nigga
platform so we don't seem as as devilish
as we sincerely are don't give a fuck
about you niggas we still respect you
niggas but here you can have a little
piece a little corner of whatever the
fuck it is that we're doing just do the
music so I don't I don't understand the
problem is racism isn't real that's what
it feels like to me I mean also like I
still look at this like girl and fucking
t-shirts to face systemic oppression no
I don't give a shit about that it really
feels like jay-z saw an opportunity to
cash in and make a whole bunch of money
on top of doing things that I think like
you said ultimately a lot of them will
be good for the community my thing is
the whole outreach and raising awareness
and stuff like that could have been done
with up NFL because once I was doing it
without the NFL I just if if there isn't
a an effect on the powers that be within
the NFL right that literally locked this
man out of having a job because he was
speaking facts and exercising his right
to protest some real shit that's going
on in this country like if we're not
actually doing something to that machine
then it's just like like you literally
just said you have done this completely
separate of the NFL exactly because the
NFL is still a racist ass institution
here it was more like we are just really
wish all the coloreds which shut up
about how mad they are at us and I guess
they thought you know putting jay-z's
name on the Super Bowl performances was
gonna be the best way to do that and it
just like make your fucking money have
your deals or whatever ultimately I
don't care but don't tell me is
something that is not don't tell me that
this is like the way that we create
change and impact communities and all
that and like as if it had to be done
through the fucking NFL it just didn't
right concerts and
and activism donations and things like
that within communities that he didn't
deserve it all of that stuff is great
and it's nice or whatever but doing that
with the NFL does not I it just doesn't
feel like it's really making a movement
in the direction that we need for this
specific subject right you know I mean
it's just like like I said the NFL gave
you the space to do your Negro thing for
Negroes and it's like so y'all gonna
leave us alone right and I mean I have
not I stopped watching out of protest
when they did call in the way they did
and like I said my health has been
better for it so I fully anticipated not
watching the NFL again except for the
Super Bowl which I know I'm problematic
but baby's birthday I simply have to but
I mean and then there's the whole issue
of like the confusion between jay-z
saying that you know he had talked to
Colin about it beforehand and then
Nestle jumping on Twitter talking about
notify all of these very yes messages
and things like this was like and
ultimately the reason why Colin was
kneeling in the first place to protest
the fact that police can do whatever
they want to and largely go unpunished
it's still a massive issue and I don't
see the NFL actually doing something
with local police departments around the
country to lessen that as an issue right
just said here negroes is a check that
is not even a corner of dick cheese to
us like we don't give a fuck about this
go do your Negro thing and basically
build back up our publicity or our image
or whatever which unfortunately there
are enough Negroes from all sections of
the intelligence spectrum yeah they're
just not being you know they're not cool
like I said I feel like they're they're
very likely our people and recognizable
people involved with this whose
intentions are good but it just I don't
yeah and I don't see the the real point
in it other than already very very rich
people getting even richer which okay
but don't tell me it's about social
justice like that's really it
if you gonna partner with the
billion-dollar NFL just make it about
the money because it's clearly about the
money I just I get the whole we have to
I sincerely get the whole at some point
we have to to communicate and blah blah
blah or whatever whatever I get that
the issue is don't nobody ever really
want to communicate everybody just wants
to find the quickest biggest band-aid so
everybody else was shut the fuck up yeah
they keep making some money
that's what these NFL owners are like
listen do whatever you have to do to get
the black people to shut the real thing
we just won them we're really watch our
football and leave us alone abandoned
Negro is exactly so jay-z what can you
do here yeah I just I don't I can't say
I'm disappointed cuz I don't put too
much stock in hope and in most
celebrities anyway who is buying inspire
change merged who is buying that
you think white NFL fans are buying
inspire change merchandise don't get the
fuck out of here at most is plenty of
white NFL fans are like y'all have a
good time in Chicago tomorrow I was
surprised at how many people that I
follow on Instagram and Twitter did not
already know who Meghan Trainor was I
could as a very same question about some
of your Negro faves I'm feeling super
old these days oh yeah I'm talking about
to crap I don't know
Emma doesn't said I finally looked up
Megan the stallion driving the boat and
I just realized she's not actually
driving about that I'm only 31 and I'm
just gonna go ahead and rest in my anus
because when y'all was saying that y'all
met Meg it was out on the water just be
old and that's fine with me
it is for you accept it you're like I
don't care that it's not 45 on the
Friday
my knees hurt my back is exhausted and
you know what I've got some how to get
away with murder binging to do I don't
have anything to say to you my my DVR is
far more enticing then pretty much what
any of you niggas have planned for the
weekend I've got an episode and a half a
few years of pose I've got Lee just
realized I had been saving the blackish
season finale like all this time I had
been saving it cuz I just wasn't ready
for it - yeah I do that was show
sometime and so I finally just today
went back and watched the season finale
and and cried when Julie was talking
about his job like it's putting it to
Grandma on grimaldo he was like my job
is to maintain and track these hash so
she was like baby that's not help let me
not get started cuz I'll stand for all
those women right here right now I can
stay in the bed marseilles been
celebrating her birthday for like a
month
Traci got a haircare line coming out yes

beauty.com when it comes I need to know
give me the things anyway I'm not coming

because this bottom would be less
whatever
speaking of drinks I saw that you
tweeted something about like falling
down the stairs in front of somebody
sure did did you really yep were you
drinking I wasn't drinking balance and
apparently thought that I was on a
fucking a 2001 Disney Channel show oh no
I was simply attempting to walk I missed
a step and fully like ships forward then
tried to can't can't like catch my
balance yeah using the railing missed
the railing I was kind of like a whole
cartoonish like it wasn't like a full
fall like on hands and knees and face
I'll call my balance but it was still it
was real bad and it's very very very
cute Nick who was right in front looked
and like made like they could have
knocked me unconscious Laura so that I
didn't even know that that happened to
you what can you do Oh bitch you lying
somebody probably too cute whatever all
the time you too fine to be worth a damn
so what is it well they're probably like
super nice people to mm-hmm but that's
what makes me feel better about it it's
assuming you're trash yeah no absolutely
yeah you got a whole bunch of kids
spread out all over the goddamn place
you're a habitual liar you cheat like oh
he's kind of cute no no let's not think
about it like that

really counts you may know Jeannie as

I've caught like clips that somehow made
to themselves into gossip whatever

[Music]

friends or whatever but it's like
official okay they're literally hugging
on the beach looking huge this nigga
Jeezy look like he got on linen shorts
her caption says shit hello honey took
on a whole new meaning I don't get it
and he's tags let's see what his caption
says he posted a more thuggish photo of
the couple he's got on
a TMT uh is like a bulletproof vest or
some shit is iconic jewelry bandana and
his caption says she loved when I talked
at fly shit WCW they're fucking adorable
bro I know that her last name is
pronounced mine but I'm gonna call them
as a couple Jeezy may just because I
feel like Jeezy may sound like an old
black lady that like cooks cakes and
pies but she also sell a little weed
Congrats girls did you see that oh I am
T it's definitely not so positive about
this I have a feeling that you did not
see that clip of what Jeannie said on
the real a while back today so you saw
it about that black meat on the side oh
I don't know it was a few years ago but
it was on that talk show and she said
something like I love black guys but for
me on the side I don't know I just see
the whole thing I saw just wait hold on
here goes
I found it do you want to hear it can
you do oh sorry my bad wait this is back
with Tamar was on the show
[Music]
Tamara looked appropriately shocked I
always saw like the first 15 seconds of
that this is a bigger longer clip it's
about one and a half minutes if you find
it on YouTube but yeah I guess her
document was good enough to get upgrade
it's uh the main course cuz as of a few
years ago she wasn't trying to hear that
bullshit yeah yeah
well Congrats girls your photographs
look lovely hope that you skip through
the farmers market together skip through
the trap together depending on who's
date is and good luck moving on so
everyone the Grande also known as
sleeves around this neck of the woods
[Music]
sleeves she's suing forever 21 oh they
really tried knots Bratz doll baby says
that she wants 10 million of them thank
all right now bitch you naughty ain't
got no damn hoes I'm filing for
bankruptcy she wants ten million dollars
in damages alleging the violation of her
right of publicity false endorsement
trademark infringement and copyright
infringement now here's a story
apparently back when the when the the
traphouse video came out okay yeah but
she thinks just about it yeah that that
uh that song we've so long I don't know
is so much money just to have that these
are a few of my favorite things sample
no these are a few of my favorite things
that's fucking sound of music I feel
like it's that white lady Julie Andrews
during Christmas my favorite
sound why cuz you get things on
Christmas yes my favorite things is from
The Sound of Music
anyway they pay she paid an absurd
amount of money to be able to sample
that and it was a short sample it's my
least favorite part of the whole song
because it's listing a bunch of gifts
[Music]
did you think it was a Christmas maybe I
did I don't know what the five sincerely
thought that that was like a holiday
song I know somebody gave my mama like
one of those this is a recipe it's super
I think somebody gave my mother like a
photo frame once it was like old I asked
for the frames we would like press a
button and it would play a melody almost
like a card yeah bad she gave them one
of those or she got one of those for
Christmas and the song was this that
makes a lot apparently forever21 was
looking to work with ariana grande on
some endorsement stuff with them during
the time that this record was about to
come out or video or whatever and
couldn't Booker couldn't afford her yes
they could not work it out because they
didn't have the money for Ariana in fact
the lawsuit allegedly says that a single
Instagram post by this young woman 26 in
fact is well into the six figures and
it's worth which doesn't shock me but
maybe send me all my gag at that so
here's the deal apparently after not
having any legal partnership with
appropriate they decided to go ahead and
use screen grabs from the OS called
seven rings yes I don't know hey don't
make no damn sense I don't even know
what the seven rings part is about but
I've only listened to this like twice so
whatever one is on me all right so they
took screen grabs from the video and
posted it on their social along with a
girl who was being described as a
look-alike just because she has a high
ponytail I mean when I tell you this
girl don't look nothing like ariana
grande besides having a pony yeah
but I think she is supposed to and then
she has on this like fleamarket version
of that Sailor Moon shit that she's
wearing in the video exactly and you
know Ariana's team is saying they are
and they captioned it with Ariana's
lyric oh yeah they said gee thanks just
about it I think that they also posted
videos from our captures from the thank
you next video
and whatever so Ariana's team is
basically accusing for every 21 of
trying to fool people into thinking that
she is working with them as a way to get
her fans and whatever other people are
influenced by her to spend their money
on these seven rings knockoffs and stuff
like that so she wants 10 million
goddamn dollars and she's not gonna hear
anything else about it was her to
forever21 knows that all they do is make
knockoff versions of pop star shit and
sell it to you for $12 yeah they were
fashioned over before fashion over in
that fashion of is the one drive mistake
through their hearts that's what's
really ironic that is really the truth
may have sincerely fucked up what I
think they really fucked up was just
using pictures of her on their page they
should have just posted homegirl whoever
this is with that shit with the
meatballs on her head and then just
been like there you go yeah actually
used pictures from her video and where
the fuck out I'm sure they gonna have to
I'm sure they're not gonna give her 10
million ain't got no no they ain't got
that but they're gonna have to give her
something and that's not even the only
picture there's another one where the
girl's face is cut off entirely so you
can't really see it but it looks like it
might be I mean it don't look like it it
doesn't necessarily look like her but
which i think is i think all you have to
do is create yeah because I remember Kim
Kardashian did the same thing member
when they put Reggie Bush's new
girlfriend in that old navy commercial
Kim Kardashian was like y'all heard that
bitch cuz she looks like me and I'll be
goddamned and they settled out of court
matters just because she really does oh
maybe posted Kim Kardashian on the
instigate like this to me seems like a
step further like right I mean 20 months
lawyers should have really known you
know I was feeling nobody consulted
legal shit that I said
whoever's I do in social or marketing or
whoever who was like let's post actual
pictures of her side by side and I mean
I I really don't have no problem with
Ariana suing these people behind this I
do think it was clear that forever21 was
trying to create confusion and get
Ariana's fans to shop I can't disagree
with that not to mention I also right
here on the New York Times that
forever21 agreed to take down whatever
pictures in February around when the
music video came out I think okay they
didn't take them down until midday
proceeding but now I guess I see why
because the sales have been struggling
here lately with fashion over fashion
over got a fast fashion unethically
produced asses on everybody's neck so I
mean I would be on the red carpet and
they would have this shit on the side
before that bitch was in her seat which
I actually think was deliberate like I
think she was I think fashion Nova has a
direct line to the Kardashians like I
think some of that shit is being
authorized by the Cardona that's not
true I mean
in Kim Kardashian also claims her ass is
real even went so far as to create a
whole fake ass episode on I'm so mad
that I actually saw but it was like
years ago she's like my ass is real and
she like went to a doctor to prove it
Kylie said the same thing about her lips
and she was like no no I was just like
when Chloe had a DNA test to prove Oh J
when her daddy so Malik Yoba this is
complicated this is a whole world wind
it is a thing this goes up and down
around and around mm-hmm
so Malik Yoba took to Instagram to
address a few things some feelings
mm-hmm he brought up the death of
Maurice will be known as Rhys who was a
twenty year twenty year old man from
Philly who first they said that he
killed himself from being bullied I
thought he did because he was openly in
a relationship with a trans woman named
BAE and you know the story went that he
was being bullied and couldn't take any
killed himself now I'm reading that
according to Newsweek he died from a
drug overdose my question was what if he
overdosed on purpose yeah I mean right
the thing is overdoses can be but I also
saw on his ex I guess now anyway I saw
him the girlfriend face Instagram that
he was like super upset because she had
left him because he was randomly abusive
and stuff like that song like oh my god
yikes shit
so Malik Yoba basically brought this
story up on his page and posted this
video of of Maurice where he's you know
attempting to defend faith seemingly and
his love for her and all of this other
stuff before he died yeah and then he
then goes on to talk about to address
the black community and
trans people deserve love and respect as
do those of us that love them is what he
says he says I love all women and count
myself among those that find themselves
trans attracted and I too have felt the
self-imposed shame that comes with that
truth but it's time to speak up
he also said that he's gonna be
participating in a March in DC my trans
March okay as well as a workshop that
he's supposed to be hosting this is the
National transmissibility March in
Washington DC and I think it supposed to
take place around the end of this month
so he's also supposed to be speaking at
a workshop there that was I think it's
called love and trauma something like
that can't find it here in front of me
right now okay so of course this nigga
you know was then bombarded by whole
lots of gags and memes and jokes and hoe
temporary and you know he did get loads
of support from people who were
applauding him for being a brave
straight man whatever yeah and there's
also a woman named Mariah
evany yep who came forward and said that
I'm serving this is for all applaud and
salute Maliki ever revealing his
so-called transit track that understand
that either because of his because of
deeper issues he has or because of
society pushing him and others to deep
dark places his admission to be sick to
being sexually attracted trans women is
bound to open a Pandora's box for him
now because the women are trans but
because many of the trans women he
engaged in sexual exploration and
exploitation with on 14th Street Times
Square and elsewhere were minors
including myself she then goes on to
write about when she's seen him how
homegirls of her were encouraging her to
go in hook up with him because he seemed
to like her and he was famous
she was 13 and also says that you know
due to child's sex abuse laws in the
state of New York he is going to be
still dealing with this today and claims
that that's the only reason that he's
coming out as trans attracted in the
first place so that's on the table that
really I was like goddamn it's like god
damn my nigga do I have to wait 10
seconds to clap my hands right you
really do you don't even cuz at first I
was like this is great you know maybe
this will inspire other straight black
men you don't even have to come out but
you could stop like stop being a
dickhead that would be great this is
phenomenal and then Mariah I mean and
she also said I don't care who thinks
I'm trying to ride a wave which I don't
even know how anybody could think that
cuz if you're trying to ride a wave
Malik Yoba would not be it not in 2019
maybe back when New York undercover was
still on air but like then again nobody
to be like trying to lie and attach own
name to for some fucking favor cloud so
it's rough sometimes when you're a part
of the community or identify as part of
the community and so you kind of just
know better through years of experience
but you just have to still deal with the
onslaught of stupid people that don't
know because if you did this would be
fucking bleep like I wouldn't even in
Miami Florida
I grew up 17 18 years old around people
that identified as trans and not who
we're messing with all kinds of things
that were coming through Miami that
weren't from there and we're getting
their lives because her family don't
live there their baby mama don't live
there their wife don't live there who
ever lived there and they're into my you
know party and they're getting their
lives in the community and keep this to
themselves this would not gag me at all
I'm not mean so I mean not me at this
big age but yeah I didn't know nobody
openly trans in high school or college
oh it took me an incredibly long time to
meet anybody trans but it also took me a
long time to meet anybody Jewish it's
just where I grew up in
how I grew up are you supposed to do
environment listen you know when you're
done being ignorant and you make a
choice to do better and be better than
but you have to make yes and you have to
tofu things you do wrong and you have to
accept that everybody is not going to
accept your apology or your remorse or
whatever and they don't have to and they
don't have to not that I was ever in
somatic don't let me so let me get the
line on myself but I was certainly
transphobic I had never had an actual
phobia disdain disgust or anything
towards trans people specifically trans
women because trans women were more
visible in my life than men earlier on
there were no trans people in my life so
I'm talking about just you know gassing
up my little Honda Civic and going to
the gay club in Miami over in a city
somewhere and I'm like 17 18 years old
in the club like that those are my first
in-person experiences with these women
so Wow also did not go to the club for
the first time until I was like 21 I
[Music]
never had a fake ID here Beyonce I was
doing the single ladies where she runs
up on the wall were you really I was oh
[Music]
oh wow
see I would have thought it was sort of
girls you wouldn't even cuz you know we
used to spell like that girls will come
through but for the most part I can't
more where the girls used to go but it
was a little further up north you know
it's really well I went to more lesbian
parties in Oklahoma City than I do in
New York I don't know where the blue
well I don't have to be more here I mean
there have to be more but I am not part
of none of them communities I don't know
none of them people in Hakata life it
was like one Facebook account everybody
know check it to find out where the
party is I'll put you all okay because I
feel like just especially through
sweetie - knowing dimples and all of
that
I've met a lot of promoters I think that
are stationed and I think that lesbians
are so sick of everybody shit
yeah and they mostly just want to be
around lesbian that they keep their shit
very I never I've talked about this
that's how I left the gay party and I
think I was getting ready to walk home
and there was a lesbian party right next
door and having gone a sweetie million
times I was like oh this is the fucking
watch to the door and a nice studly
bouncer told me no I understand fucking
straight women in a bachelorette party I
know you want to go out and not get
groped and assaulted I know that but you
don't get to come in here and like
spread your bullshit all over this gay
man safe space
I once tweeted I remember what party I
was at but I surely was watching some
girls at the gay club just having a good
time and I think I tweeted something
along the lines I've shout out to all
the straight girls who love coming in
gay parties because they don't have to
deal with sexual harassment yes and a
lot of the gays was like but I do I get
it you gotta have respect you gotta know
your place like this isn't just a club
like all of the hundreds houses close
the child can go to most of ours are
very like one of few if not the only
only one and it's a safe space for us to
be us and free and I have to worry about
you coming in with your whole straight
thing and dance on us because you know
we don't want to go home with you yeah I
understand the
urghhh but no girls it's not for you
like I've been to enough straight club
strip clubs and things like that and
witnessed niggas be awful to y'all so I
get ya
behind me play a position just doing
that shit to us literally did not come
here for none of what you got but anyway
as far as New York undercover is
concerned Brad well god bless everyone
involved aside from the accusations
against Malik Yoba
about whatever he may have been doing in
the 90s or whenever a lot of what he
said is absolutely on the money yep
a lot of you niggas know full full well
who you doing what you doing when you're
doing it and Malik you always should not
be the only nigra in entertainment
sports whatever the fuck that comes
forward and says these things because
again being a part of the community
big 31 almost 32 years of age now I
think I have a better understanding of
how this works to look at you the way
that this actually is but because of
everybody else's bullshit you just get
sucked into this vortex of bullshit and
toxicity and darkness and whatever the
fuck else and you got to be all confused
maybe you like women yeah exactly
I mean I am glad like you said when I
first thought I was like praise God that
you know a straight black man finally
came out and said this Thank You Amen
and then Mariah came out with her
statement I was like so maybe another
one has not been accused of assaulting
underage girls if maybe one more if you
could be brave enough to speak up I just
think it would be phenomenal thank you
so much like having difficulty with
accepting whatever your sexual urges
maybe your sexual identity is and
sleeping with a 13 year old a 14 year
old or whatever
super super separate and even you know
engaging with a sex worker oh please go
out there and book these processes but
they need to be of age I saw I mean
that's literally it I don't have no
problem with you paying for sex none at
all
just let it be an adult who is
consenting to this shit like a child and
then I saw it was like once when I don't
know if it was once but it was when she
was 13 and then again when she was 16 so
it's like I didn't even know that yeah
yeah so I mean and a 16 year old might
be able to pass for 18 a 13 year old
does not I and I just is just well you
know eating this fried chicken my
friends not users joke there it's
Church's Chicken I make these 15 euros
look oh yeah it definitely is got these
8 year olds starting a period issue not
a right but like come on now my nigga ya
know there's no excuse don't we are
friends unfortunately life is
complicated unless they're super
ridiculous and it's funny okay well
maybe if Mariah and the girls actually
pressed charges then we'll see where
this goes abuse laws means that like
even though this was 20 over 20 years
ago something can still be done so yeah
I mean I'm all for getting everybody who
is out here raping minors getting them
niggas the fuck out so yeah don't you
love how this show always just we just
go on these really positive tangents
everything is just like so nice and good
well at least LeBron James is working on
trademarking oh the time no not talk
about that okay trademarking the term
Taco Tuesday don't know how many of you
are aware but LeBron and his family have
been celebrating Taco Tuesday
is especially popular in the West Coast
and Texas places yeah apparently he's
now working towards filing this
trademark for specifically let me see if
I can find the actual description of the
tie of the trademark itself because I
know that it's meant to be for like um
if they ever decide to use it for things
like podcasts TV so on so like that's
where they filed it but I can't remember
the oh my god there are so many Taco
Tuesday I mean but that's the actual
movie I think the person who has the
trademark right now is um in Wyoming and
the place is called Taco John's there
are so many they're like I'm looking on
the USPTO right now it looks like at
least 10 live trademarks that include
Taco Tuesday so they must all be under
something different bra look cuz you
know it's not just the name it's also
like how you plan to use them ya know
that's the most important part of these
things I think a lot of people here you
know such as such as trade marketing
thing in things and it means to them
that this person is trying to prevent me
from ever saying since the trademark
would apply to downloadable audio and
visual works social media podcasts and
online entertainment services is on the
hill so it sounds to me that they may be
planning on using Taco Tuesday as the
name of a show yes podcast webseries I
know that you know oh this must be
LeBrons trademark right here I'm looking
at it yep LBJ trademarks LLC I know he
has that show on HBO I don't know what
the plan is but they claim there is no
specific plan in place for Taco Tuesday
right now but what they are attempting
to do this prevent anybody
suing them in the future her student
LeBron
if they do decide to use it for
something they won't get this trademark
I highly doubt and here's why Taco
Tuesday
goddamn common and even people who do
have you know documents and trademarks
filed and shit like that for Taco
Tuesday at the moment many of them can't
really defend the legitimacy of the
trademark to their specific company
brand or whatever because Taco Tuesday
is an old ass fucking saying yeah and
nobody really knows exactly where it
came from
Wow I mean and even if he does get it
he's not gonna be able to sell no Murch
because these other people already have
it for it's like two different
trademarks as far as like using Taco
Tuesday on like clothes like my was that
LeBron James is probably going to do
some read table talk style shoot Taco
Tuesday with his family where they talk
about whatever and they eat tacos and
probably have some of his famous tacos
and shit with them and that is probably
what their trailer probably so again
specifically when you do file a
trademark you have to expense all of
these like categories that you're filing
the trademark for and that's all you can
ever really dispute it for exactly but
yeah again a spokesperson for LeBron
James
LBJ trademarks says you know they don't
have any specific plans and they're not
telling anybody that they can't say Taco
Tuesday go to Taco Tuesday a please as
it sounded to me this is like basic
legal team yes stuff probably got
nothing to do it LeBron LeBron probably
had a meeting with his manager or
something was like maybe like a Taco
Tuesday podcast or something you know as
the basics gently does say that an
attorney found this so there you go
their proxy because unlike forever 21
LeBron includes his lawyers in his
conversation and they immediately said
alright let's jump on this legally
all of it they literally said we don't
want nobody to sue this exactly that's
it and that is your lawyers job no one
even said he may have it yet the whole
legal department of Everett winning that
21 got to be livid whole social team
well good luck with whatever this is
shit I mean obviously it it left a not
so flavorful taste and some folks now
because it's Taco Tuesday especially
over in the LA of things is super
popular okay yeah I mean that phrase so
many billions of times that I have never
even thought about it it's so it's older
than me it has to be I have seen it so
many fucking times so I really didn't
think nothing of it like you I assumed
it was gonna be a show or whatever the
hell because he's been posting clips and
pictures on his Instagram and that Taco
Tuesday thing has been like a huge hit
so how much attention is like personal
personal business by have seen a few of
the clips of him yelling Taco Tuesday
and stuff like that around and being
with his family so I get what they're
doing I don't think that this is
anything that needs to raise any true
alarm because you niggas may still have
your tacos on Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
whenever you fuckin want to play you can
call a Taco Tuesday if you want to in
fact you can even make your own damn
tacos on Tuesday which friends you know
LeBron James can't do see you and I
honestly truly doubt he would even want
to he knows he didn't come up with that
phrase
you could likely start a podcast called
Taco Tuesday right now and be straight
yeah I didn't know there was backlash
but it's probably could ever say these
words I don't see how anybody LeBron
James or anyone else could be like Taco
Tuesdays is ours and and here is how we
can prove that it exists solely because
of us there's another thing with
trademarks today you could easily have a
trademark for something or file a
trademark for something and even if it's
not a super popular thing if somebody
else had it and was using it and making
money from it before you they do have a
case to go in front of a judge or
whatever and be like naw bitch so well
I'm sure the lawyers already knew this
but the Taco Tuesday podcast officially
ended in 2016 there you go I'm sure they
would not have filed this if that
podcast was still a thing or they
wouldn't have found it under podcasting
which is there specifically listed
podcasting service downloadable audio
and video works podcast such insight
exactly you may still have your tacos
every other restaurant in this country
and also like respects Mexican Mexican
American people and things like that for
actually giving a la cosa a very
delicious I really feel like Republicans
should not be allowed to enjoy I don't
think y'all should be banned from
enjoying Mexican food awful way y'all
treat is only right to me it really is
and every time there's like a story of
one of y'all crazy white maggot Amy's
going into a Mexican restaurant and
getting mad cuz the people speaks like
bitch do you know where you are do you
know how bitch do you know where you are
tacos work you know we came here for
food if you wanted some food that was
not Mexican perhaps you should go to
like I don't know not a Mexican
restaurant that God let you make a
restaurant and then being upset because
they roll their eyes at you bitch
that's part of the service bitch suza
culture i rolls inside i will make the
oxtail gravy pot stupid especially when
you ask for extra if you don't have a
big size roll bar it's not good if she
doesn't look at me and discuss why I
ordered literally anything I don't want
it this is probably not good anyways
great alright girls
hey y'all this week's episode of the
read is brought to you by my faith third
love that got more than 70 sizes
including half cups their love designs
bras with breast size and shape in mind
for a perfect fit in a premium feel
y'all already know how I feel about that
t-shirt bra it just hugs and supports my
titties and makes them feel so good it's
like one of very few bras if I don't
think it is the only bra that I can wear
and forget that I have it on like it is
just so completely comfortable they have

for some listener letters signora cereta
gmail.com we may read them aloud on the
show unsurprisingly we got a lot of
feedback about the letters last week and
Jan actually sent in a little note for
Kevin remember
who has the sugar daddy who's about to
pass away Oh God Sharon mentioned
something that I did not think of Jen
says do not get the cash from your
friend's dad before he dies because even
if you aren't in the will his next of
kin will have access to his financials
and the movement of that much cash will
be a big red flag furthermore he may
leave huge medical debts and expenses to
his family you call his son a friend and
while we are not judging you if you take
the money I am judging you if you watch
them struggle financially while trying
to be there for them emotional injuries
if you are not willing to claim that
money publicly and accept the
consequences just leave it sis well
that's a valid point Jan really it was a
very spare unbiased yes because you know
I I was just immediately like don't see
no problem with taking their fucking
money some of you made more sense about
that the motherfucking day if you
fucking this niggas daddy and he just
wants to give you this money before
you're gonna die and your best friends
the niggas son that knows that your
motherfucking money at the end of the
day was father's decision I didn't hear
anything in that later about you
finessing that money about possibly
having good sex which is not a finesse
when you are you are okay Kevin hope it
works out we also got a lot of responses
about Linda's letter with dealing with
her mentally ill sister-in-law I'm going
to read one of them it is a bit lengthy
but I think it's important it comes from
a therapist in I'm sorry psychologists
in Los Angeles named ittsan who said I'm
ready to say that I loved your response
to Linda's letter about her husband's
family and how frustrated she is I think
it was great the way you encouraged her
to get her own therapy and to consider
what's getting in the way of empathizing
with this woman and her difficulties I
agree with you and don't take any issue
with insights you gave the only thing I
would add is that this family absolutely
could use
some help as a unit to figure out what
to figure out what if there's something
they're doing to allow this pattern to
continue I've worked an intensive
treatment settings for most of my
post-grad career and I've seen firsthand
how family dynamics play a role in
continuing the distress of the person
getting treatment obviously I'm not this
person doctor so I can't say what's
going on in this family
however the sister might be justifiably
upset at the way the family deals or
doesn't deal with conflict or issues
within their system it may it also may
be true that the family treats the
sister as someone who is so fragile that
she can't be held accountable for her
behaviour in any way out of fear that
she may hurt herself or someone else
this takes a toll on families in ways
that they don't even realize and it's
not healthy for anyone involved
including the person who's been
identified as the patient many times
identified patients in these situations
will threaten to harm themselves or be
otherwise destructive if they don't get
their way it's not uncommon for the rest
of the family to feel like they're being
held emotionally hostage and that they
must do what the other person demands
even if it's not good for them in the
long run at this point it sounds like
the best way to make sure things change
is to have everyone go to a family
therapist hey man love therapy and be
willing to take a look at how they one
unknowingly trigger this woman and her
difficulties and take stock of how they
relate to her in problematic ways and to
enable her bad behavior out of fear that
she will hurt herself someone else or
someone's property I can understand
Linda's point that they might that they
might enable and accommodate the sister
in ways that they really cannot sustain
long term this is cause for concern
because it keeps everyone locked into
this unhealthy pattern a family
therapist would definitely be able to
give them tools to disrupt the pattern
and to practice alternative strategies
in real time it would also help them to
learn that they don't have to take
responsibility for the sisters emotions
and to be present for her needs in the
most helpful and effective ways but at
the end of the day like y'all said you
can't make you Linda cannot make her own
people do anything all she can do is
speak when her needs are work on herself
with therapy whether that's individual
couples or family and be clear about her
own boundaries and what she's willing to
tolerate in this relationship
she said she should also do her due
diligence to educate herself on her
sister-in-laws illness and try her best
to empathize with this woman's pain I
hope this is helpful and that you keep
these conversations going they're much
needed much love mitts in and I just
thought this is so good and written by
an actual professional which we are not
and thought it was really important to
add that on because I know this is not
you know exclusive to Linda at all this
is something that a lot of people are
dealing with and therapy is just she's
really that girl so yeah thank you so
much mitten and we still got into the
letters we have an update from Marcus
remember I know you don't remember
Marcus but Marcus emailed us about his
girlfriend's child he said I love her
but I hate her child yep and the
seven-year-old son was like constantly
like he just did not like Marcus at all
I remember had even accused him of like
hitting him over
so Marcus emailed us back and said all I
can say is Wow hearing you read my
letter back and give insight really put
a lot into perspective first off no I
didn't eat that niggas fruit sex fruit
sex and no I have never put my hands on
him because we were like well do you
actually whose fruit next dude you
actually hit him so even after
everything you said I still wanted to
figure out a way to make it work so over
the past two months we did couples
counseling and went on meaningful dates
I picked her up with flowers and all
that before writing in I had a trip
booked for us it was perfect timing so
we went and we really recharged however
when we came back her son was still
acting like a little demon and I
realized I couldn't no longer do this we
broke up this past weekend and although
I love her I truly feel like a weight
and a badass child have been lifted off
my shoulders we're gonna try and just do
the friend thing but I'm moving on
Marcus I can't fault you for any of this
you tried you gave it another two months
and you really tried and that little boy
is still not fucking with you
so you had to establish your own
boundaries communicate what you needed
and of course you know this woman has
the search now she's not getting rid of
her child so you had to go and there's
nothing wrong with that
why are you trying not to laugh
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
well I'm glad you knew sir I'm glad you
know Q the curb enthusiasm user oh man
we also I cannot believe we had this
mini like just people sending things in
but somebody sent in therapy resources
including therapy for black girls which
we've talked about many times but there
is also a queer and trans therapist of
color network directory we had no clue
that was a thing it is an n QT TC n
dot-com slash directory that's the
National queer and trans therapist of
color network which Wow phenomenal now
if you look at the map they are mostly
concentrated on the coasts because it's
not too safe for us anywhere else and
it's barely safe it's not even safe
first there but you know what I mean but
there are so there's you know some
scattered across the country but mostly
on the coast but maybe that will be
helpful for some of you so take a look
at that and thank you crystal for
sending that in all right finally done
with the updates okay our first oh all
right just kidding a white woman named
Sarah wrote in and said that her mother
literally taught her to cry if she is in
distress or if things go wrong or if she
needs help and so yes white women are
taught to cry when they need some
assistance do it alright first question
this week comes from let me see
Stephanie wait a minute okay yeah can
you give me a difference because the
name and her email is one thing and then
she signed it with Stephanie but then
she also said please make up a name for
me so I'm gonna just call you Caleb
alright alright well here we are with
whatever your name is Kayla says my
story starts in 2014 which was one of
the greatest years of my life it was the
year I met my son to be husband our
story began online and it was blissful
we enjoyed a brief courtship and I moved
to Dallas to begin what has been a solid
relationship my husband is an attorney
and typically spends many late hours in
the office so I've never really thought
twice about his love or loyal to me
loyalty to me but unfortunately I have
recently come across some rather
disturbing news about him that has left
me shaking mm-hmm
while I never touches
top recently a part of me felt compelled
to look through it oh yeah of course did
and apparently for the past several
years my six eleven alpha dominant
husband six eleven don't know where you
found that tree my god and I feel like
you should have left that part out I
feel like people are gonna be able
tending to be several women online he
uses platforms like Facebook and
Instagram and Twitter he has at least
nine different identities of beautiful
women that he has been pretending to be
apparently he has a penchant for
pretending to be brazilian Guamanian
women with long hair okay to add insult
to injury all the passwords that his use
for these accounts is my name Wow not
only has he spoken to strangers across
the world he has also done a host of
baiting men that we mutually know nude
photos and information after bringing it
bringing it to him and several failed
denial attempts he finally admitted that
he has been pretending to be women
online since he was an undergrad he says
he's completely heterosexual but enjoys
the thought of being hit on by men and
fantasizes about the women that he
pretends to be
I am so conflicted because and you're
still laughing so four years and two
kids later my life is inextricably
linked with this man but I am unsure if
he can actually wait wait wait four
years into like they're four years into
this relationship and they had two kids
she's had two kids so she had two kids
with him after this no no she's saying
I'm conflicted because like four years
in and two kid like she worded it
perhaps a bit confusingly but she's
saying that they've been together and
they had two kids my life is
inextricably linked with this man and I
but I am unsure if he can actually love
me knowing that he is so torn in what
appears to be his sexuality I could use
your advice and encouragement
where's also what do I do with the
information concerning all the men he
has the seat for years especially the
ones that we both know do I bring this
to them thanks for your help sincerely
Kayla so first of all I don't think this
is an issue with his sexuality sister I
think this is an issue of him
liking compliments and being on the
internet and I've said this a lot I
don't know if I've said on the show but
they are a lot of straight men that are
sincerely I don't know the worst use
they're they're just invigorated maybe
by the idea or the knowledge that men
find them attractive like I know guys
that I believe with all of my heart are
heterosexual right but love when guys
flirt with them or hate on them or like
this or whatever and it should because
the gays especially the gays of color
yeah the melanin game yes that's right
I'm here for just any ol anybody so if a
nigga think you cute bitch you should be
flattered because you probably top-tier
or they make it just doesn't have
standards
I can't blanket everybody together like
I just want straight women to know that
if your man still has the same passion
and zest might be a better word has the
same like the sex is not dropped off at
all his dick is still getting up and
staying where you need it to be and all
that then you don't have to worry about
whether he's not attracted to you like
okay that is I just want you to see
where you're going I just want you to
understand that like if his sex with you
has not changed at all you don't have to
worry about his sexuality because he's
attracted to you
so I would say that yeah if you're
getting broke off in the right way and
satisfied in the right way you know some
of y'all don't really know if it's right
but at the same time if your sex life
and romance life and all of that stuff
is pretty much solid then he is
yeah he likely attracted to you still a
good husband and still a good father and
all that I wouldn't be worried about his
his attraction or his orientation I
think the idea event okay via the the
fact that he is baiting men into sharing
nudes with him or being into whatever
this catfishing Brazilian persona is
that he is created that is separate from
his actual sexual orientation and again
as the gay I feel confident in saying
that okay doesn't mean this nigga is not
a weirdo no planning to like blackmailed
and people at some point I doubt it that
I would have a real question for like Oh
or maybe he's just like that's my friend
I want notice dick but you know what
again at the same time it's not I can't
even be like oh well you know some
niggas like when other niggas find them
attractive because you're not pretending
to be needs to be a woman so by watching
Max and Nev for like a season it was the
other ones named max okay there are
catfishing people that aren't that
catfished solely for the threat there
are a lot of people who just enjoy it
they just enjoyed the seizing people and
seeing how far they can get
motherfuckers to go because they're
attracted to someone and that again I
think is separate of sex what I'm trying
to say here is that unfortunately it
sounds like your biggest concern is
whether or not twenty years ago I was
surprised that was where you put that
like sexuality I would be more concerned
if he had actually cheated on me at
least you asked like Oh what I do with
these niggas that we you know that I
would say that he is quite likely
straight girl I'm not gonna say he
couldn't be bisexual but that's not what
it sounds like it sounds like your nigga
is one of these motherfuckers would be
catfishing motherfuckers because they
find it to be fun and I can't relate I
don't understand
but I know that that's a thing as well
so yeah I would say go ahead and pat
yourself on the back girl you know
you're not dating a queen if anything I
feel like my trust in this person would
be a little bit shaken because it's like
why have you been worse
that's so weird why are you doing this
yeah I recommend therapy like I do for
everybody but for real for y'all
specifically couples therapy so she
confronted him maybe I can get to there
because I first denied it so but it's
like computer don't play with me like
yeah write it I would recommend y'all
going to therapy or counseling and
talking about this with a professional
as far as the other man I would say you
changed my life once when you said to me
with a situation that I was unpretty to
you told me you told me afterwards that
you told this person either you go in
telling him I'm going to do it I did do
it and that changed my perspective on a
lot of shit for a long time because what
you're essentially doing in that in that
situation is is saying you and I both
know right from wrong know that you know
that this is wrong and I am in a
situation now where I feel conflicted
because I care about this person and I
don't feel comfortable not with this
person not knowing this and I do exact
so I'm gonna use you the opportunity to
do the right thing and let people know
what time it is yeah or I'm going to do
it because I can't not do it yeah I feel
like that is so passed figure it is and
he knew I was dead ass serious when I
said it like I'm not gonna keep talking
to this man who is my friend like I
don't know about this dirty shit you
done did I'm not going to do that it's
not a friend thing to do right so I'm
gonna give you the chance to tell it
because truly it is far outside the
bounds of my business I really don't
want to get involved I do not like right
in the middle of people shit I don't
like having my own shit oh I really did
not want to do it but I was like you're
gonna look even worse if this comes from
me so you might as well be a man and
telling what you did nigga I tell you
one of the few times in our life a nigga
has been for
like one of the few times do that
alright I gotta be real with you about
something yeah so yeah I mean I I feel
like that's what I thought
from the question new mics from the
question of what do I do with that
situation cuz that's how I would feel
yeah if we're talking about people that
we're friends with that we kick it with
or whatever I would feel that it's a
that that exact same way and it's like
you need to tell these people what time
it is
I don't know how you're gonna go about
doing it or whatever but you depending
on how close y'all are with these mutual
friends that suit because if it's just
like his coworkers or something I think
I would stay out of that but if it's
like people who come over to our house
for dinner parties and our kids playing
all that it's like you nothing I'm not
finna be up in these people's face I'm
not gonna do that
whoa good luck to you alright
um another scene like another strong
point on that that I definitely drifted
away did you
was it something to do with like you
throw him where I will or no no it was
super general about these types of
situations I can't remember what it is
okay I think it was very specific to two
women in there oh I can't remember what
point out the only thing I would say is
that like I want y'all to not be afraid
of your husband being bisexual because
again if he is having a strong honest
emotional connection with you and the
sex is the same that's always been like
it's very possible that that I mean even
if it is possible that your man is not
exclusively heterosexual that doesn't
mean that his feelings about you have
changed at all yeah I mean just because
he's fucking you down doesn't mean that
he has to fuck a man down you know I
mean boo if you are worried this is the
other thing though motherfuckers think
that if a man is attracted to men are
trans women he's gay
yeah he's not attracted to two women who
are a sign of a giant bird or whatever
he is just gay and all of the other
stuff is mythology yeah and so that's a
huge part of the reason and I'm not
using nobodies lives or to serum or
bullshit but we've said this time and
time again as a big part of the reason
why a lot of niggas do their dirt on the
low they might they're probably and very
very very very very likely still
attracted to you and other women they
also attracted to men too yeah and they
know that if you know that they might as
well just be gay yes ain't nobody for
the fuck with they're not safe to come
out inside it is not and part of it is
like this fear y'all have around all
that and so you know you need to work
through your own internal lash it's
truly the stigma that gay men all have
HIV and that's why black women have it
and that is that damn I'm not gonna say
it's all his fault Berlin jl king went
on Oprah and talked about the download
good thing it changed a lot for black
women and we started being like very
openly ridiculous about that whole
subjective meanwhile your second baby
father run her all through the projects
wrong thinking for every motherfucking
bitch in his sight but God forbid this
nigga be gay because that's how you
really good yeah no man could be would
you feel better if your man was cheating
on you with 30 different like cisgender
women yes even though you know he can
get any itching and scratching show from
any of those girls right back to you
but hey would this is foolish that
wasn't the point I was gonna make I
don't remember what it was I was going
to say but yes but if you don't cheat on
me and the option is like use protection
with a dude or raw Dali with a girl I'm
gonna prefer it if you use protection
we're two dudes like but I'm also a
weirdo weirdo myself and so a man being
intimate is not like a problem for me at
all because I am in some women and I
would fully expect him to be okay with
that
whoo I'm just saying for what it's worth
for anybody out there just because that
nigga nigga might be into men whether he
it's a secret deal or whatever it
doesn't mean that he is solely gay it is
just with you as his beard and we are
some niggas me
be sure that I want you to understand
that many niggas today who are playing
that role is not just because they're
gay and trying to keep a secret some of
them might be yes but a lot of them are
bisexual and have their own grievances
demons or whatever Association that they
sincerely need to seek individual
assistance with yeah
but if it helps you it doesn't mean that
he's not into you girl yeah so maybe if
you can like step down a taste think a
bit freer have open conversation yeah
more niggas can talk to you all about
what the fuck is going on in your life
and you don't have to be open up blah
now I remember what the fuck I was gonna
do a sexuality what I was going to say
and this this is proof that if you feel
compelled to reach over and grab that
niggas math book bitch keep it closed
it's in there I don't give a fuck what
you looking for bitch it's in there
leave him let me just crack this open
and take again I never go through his
laptop oh just this one but there's one
time what in what what could you think
did you might bump in in there leave it
maybe something switched up at home we
don't know because I know you niggas be
doing that shit too going through y'all
your girlfriend's your wise panty
drawers and and and looking at the text
from from Papa John's and Pizza Hut and
whatever compelled to do it
walk out on it yeah fuck it I have
actually had an ex-boyfriend cheat on me
with a man and I did not find out until
after we broke up and I wasn't mad
because it was you know gay shit or
whatever I was mad because you cheated
and then also because you like reassured
me over and over that it was like
nothing going on blada blada anyway so
fuck I just think you can like you can
look at it that way funny enough
I've been she's on before where I was
cheated on with a woman oh yeah the guy
cheated on me with a woman more than
once and I always looked at it like well
of course you do like what was I
supposed to have of China
I never looked at it like how could you
deceive her I don't know I mean you are
a deceiver but I'm not mad at you
because of the orientation or the the
genitals or the it's not Orion take the
identity of the person you slept with
I'm mad because you cheated on me yeah
and so I just want straight black women
so really it is internalized homophobia
that is what that is and I know you
don't think you're homophobic but you
really need to work through that because
this is specifically homophobia against
the gay men because we all know that
women can be bisexual trisexual they can
admit that they had a crush on the best
friend in college or whatever and nobody
would expect a man to leave his wife
over it nigga
nobody niggas would jump in the air
freeze-frame like some Molly Ringwald
movie a shit I'm talking about niggas
are doing Yusuf's jumping jacks prepared
yes for some girl-on-girl right so we so
if you see an issue here you really need
to work through your homophobia about
gay men and the sex that they have how
much like any nasal line to you being
deceitful not being honest with you
about whatever is you know you you have
the right to be upset about that you
have the right to walk away as I've said
before you have a right to walk away
because they're gonna do the dishes or
whatever like whatever your reasoning is
I don't give a thought but I just hope
that more people will start to think
differently
so that we can start having more
conversation and doing real work
yes ain't never gonna get anybody
anywhere I would love for more men to
come out as bisexual I would love that I
might actually be able to tolerate you
all of you about sex
I just hate that like bisexual I think
it's called by erasure like tumblr has
made it even queer people are hating us
with this idea that that bisexual man
yeah don't exist how stupid can you be
I'm exa that that dog won't sit most of
them just lie exactly exactly because
they know if they say that today
girlfriend he will be branded labeled as
gay ostracized his home
some of your homegirls you'd be going to
brunch with about how they feel you
don't say I'm not excusing any nigga for
lying to anybody about their sexuality
obviously but what I am saying is a lot
I I understand I understand because if
you would like to continue dating women
or just not be judged or looked at funny
it's like it's safer to just pretend
that you are exclusively straight even
y'all niggas that ain't dating nobody
that's gay or bi or would ever be out
here casually saying extremely
homophobic repeating extremely
homophobic shit but feeling like you're
not homophobic because and they could
that does your hair is a huge screen
look so or you makeup artist or your
makeup artist yes or your best friend
from eighth grade so I mean just don't
nobody's making it easy out here for
anybody all right good luck to y'all our
next question comes from Dee who says a
few weeks ago my homophobia again a few
weeks ago my homophobic dad and I had
yet another argument where he tried to
bring me down with the most hateful
words possible about my homosexuality
after the call I told my mother siblings
and boyfriend that I am done with him
and his abuse and cutting him off
officially he lives three times always
time zones away so we only communicate
by phone damn and I don't need to
subject myself to someone who's tried to
break me down over his struggle not mine
oops there you go I guess this decision
has gotten back to him and he's been
calling and texting to try to talk he
almost never reaches out to me so this
isn't normal and when I checked the
voicemail it's always something dumb
like inviting me to a block party or
wishing me happy national left hand
handers day
what would be great about this is if
that nigga is not my people all say that
he's obviously trying to put the fight
behind us but I'm struggling to forgive
after so many years
am i preventing an opportunity to
reconcile because I'm choosing to click
to close him out I don't want to give
him the opportunity to ignore his abuse
but at the same time I'd want a
relationship with him if one were
possible how do I give a chance without
jeopardizing myself in the process
thanks Dee I'm a pretty cut-and-dry
person when it comes to this type of
stuff and I feel like I would just hit
my father with like alright all of that
left-handers - it is whatever but if you
want to talk to me we have things to
talk a bounce and until we do that I'm
not interested in this yeah and it's
fascinating to me it's really telling
that once you verbally acknowledge that
you were off it wait you're with your
pops right that then these things start
to move forward yeah many of our parents
Perkis and are very destructive to us
with things that they say and do even
though their intention wildly is still
for us to have the best yeah so it's
usually thankfully I guess but a lot of
times when we get to a place where we
don't we know that we don't need them
and we're now relying on that and we're
just like okay you know when they're
like cool
whatever you do that over there and I'm
gonna do me over here and I'm good I
think that it puts a lot of parents in a
place where you're first of all they
have to confirm the fact that they are
finite and whoa I don't know how many
parents that truly love their kids want
to turn to dust with their kids not
fucking with that I mean exactly
so I do think a lot of times
and I'm not trying to paint a picture or
generalize this because I know that's
not everybody's story but I do think
that a lot of times parents will do
things like this to try and inch their
way back in yeah but it's hard
especially with men to confront their
own ignorances and the stuff that
they're struggling with yeah when it
comes to you and I don't know what it is
specifically that you're looking for
from your father in terms of accepting
you for who you are and whatever the
relationship looks like that afterwards
for me would be just so much as like
look we don't I don't even really need
you to understand so much as I need you
to just respect yes empathize and love
you don't need to you know I mean get
gay culture and understand every chapter
of it or whatever just understand it is
a thing it is an okay thing I have your
son I am NOT just this gay to bitch you
made oh and you have to be supportive if
I bring my boyfriend around you need to
welcome that person like you need to not
ice them out or make them feel like
they're not welcome around us or
whatever it's not like I accept you but
not your gayness no there's not a sense
if if if we're going to Thanksgiving and
family and cookouts and all of this
stuff and my sister boyfriend could come
or my brother girlfriend could just have
bitch you better motherfucker grin and
bear all the times I got my ass whipped
to put on punch yeah yeah huh so I'm
going to tell the internet this that I
have not said so I'm gonna do it let's
see where this goes even though I know
where this it feels like it's a mistake
what I'm gonna say it anyway
huh so I know what this is like because
I have actually cut off contact with my
father I have disowned him we do not
have a relationship we do not speak that
has been the case for
it's almost a year now and he did a lot
of the same things your dad did like
before I got to the point of cutting him
off like he would randomly call and be
like I was just thinking about you
because you know I saw a black girl
today and it's like what so anyway but
he knew that things were fraught between
us not necessarily because of the
homophobia but it certainly didn't help
there was lots of shit going on there
and I knew because my father is very
very smart that this was not a
conversation that could be had over the
phone or email or anything else because
that nigga can finesse his way out of
anything if you don't confront and so
the next time I saw him in person you
know he tried to do that bullshit
everything is fine you know whatever
gave me a hundred dollars like that
meant something to me I took that
hundred dollars and I literally gave it
to the relative closest to me I was like
hey you may have this I do not I just
gave anyway it don't matter and so I
told him then you and I need to have a
conversation before you leave here today
laid it out just like that yeah and when
we you know went off to the side just
the two of us and started having this
conversation it ended poorly to say the
least and it was from that and I told
him then you and I are no longer in
relationship with one another like I
will fully call you by your first name
and I did comment by his first name
that's what pushed him over the edge
but it was like I'm not gonna call you
daddy or treat you like a father when I
don't feel that way about you
right and he chose instead of like doing
better and choosing to be a part of my
life he chose to walk away and that is
perfectly fine because you know thanks
to therapy I was well prepared for this
point and I was like ready to do it and
you know all that sort of things so it
wasn't really like I was afraid of it it
was more like I know this was how I was
gonna go but when it's a parent you
still have this like little tiny mustard
seed of Hope way deep down where you
can't even see it all of us in where
it's just like please let this nigga
magically like get it know that he's
wrong and acknowledge that and apologize
and make an effort to do better
and that didn't happen so I cut them off
we have not spoken since in and I don't
have no issue with that at all and so I
think you really have to get to a place
where it can't just be that you told
your mom and your siblings and all that
because I'm sure that is how he got back
to him but you need to tell him
face-to-face or maybe not even
face-to-face you might have a father who
is not a huge liar but you need to tell
him you and I are not speaking because
of these reasons and if you cannot
respect me as a human being
acknowledge where you went wrong
apologize for those things because you
inflicted a lot of hurt on me this was
not just some random you know one-off
flyway bullshit that had no effect on my
life right your father then it is deeply
interesting if I can if I can trace a
lot of my issues or the issues I have
with myself back to you yeah that's the
parental trauma is deep deep super deep
aren't even aware that they have it who
it is so I think it's important to say
that to him and let him know that if
he's not ready to atone apologized do
better and not just do better in words
but in actions to show you that he means
it that you are simply not going to have
a relationship with him and that it is
totally up to him yeah that way it's not
him constantly reaching out to you even
though he knows what's up and
bullshitting about it it's you saying
you know what we're both wrong here so
I'm a grown man now I may be your child
but I am NOT a child right and so I'm
going to talk to you like another adult
because that's what this is a
conversation between two adults hence
your childhood certain self that little
boy who was wounded over and over by a
homophobic father he deserves to have
you stand up for him now you couldn't do
it then because of the power
differential was just not in a place
especially if you grew up in a typical
black household we're talking back at oh
man she was getting knocked across the
room uni man talk back after Sam much
less listen we were not even allowed to
say that we were mad or upset with our
parents why
any questions just look bad and my dad
would literally stop me and say do you
have a problem with what I just said you
know say yes yes in households where you
are not where children are not allowed
to be anger angry or express anger
that's an adult is my father today with
me yes because I'm an adult and I can do
that now what you're gonna do with me
send me to my room
oh I can't go to the football game on
Friday just go back to my house you
cannot do nothing to me at this point so
it's time for me to advocate for that
little girl who deserves better so many
times throughout her life and you
deserve to do that exact same thing that
is how you give him a chance to redeem
himself without jeopardizing you and
your happiness and your safety yep
you just have to confront him with it
and it is hard it is not easy
conversation my voice was shaking the
whole time because it's the first time I
ever really stood up to him I had
bitches you know you know just wipe
things away just pretend it's not
happening just you know I've heard from
a lot of people great at least your
daddy was married to your mom and you
got both parents in the home like that
ain't nothing like people said that type
of shit like oh it's not that it's like
you and and not just saying that his
actions weren't that bad but that me
being upset by it was too much or I was
overreacting or that still yo daddy
niggas love that shit harder I don't
give a fuck a lot of niggas donate sperm
being a father is an active process yeah
you have to do the work of being a good
father
it should not be easy so I think you
deserve to confront him in this way if
it helps for you to like write out what
you want to say in advance I didn't do
that probably should've but you know we
got I got the job done regard
yeah if it helps to write it out then do
that but yeah it's called conversation
but one that needs to happen
I definitely think writing it out can
help you even if you don't use the
actual paper or whatever you write out
just having like an overall idea of how
you're gonna address it in the flow of
what you're going to address I think can
be an asset to the situation but you're
1,000% right you know you have to
unfortunately a lot of people who bring
on physical emotional mental harm on
others don't have a like a single idea
on how to approach it
you know when they know that they're
wrong don't know how to approach an
apology or taking responsibility for any
of it or anything it doesn't always mean
they don't want to it is just difficult
especially when they know for a fact
that you're over it or off so like you
attempted to do and like I would suggest
with this with this listener just you
know I mean I'm I'm nothing to play this
dance of passive aggression with you and
talking about holidays all that other
stuff you and I got real issues that we
need to discuss I would love nothing
more for us to have a happy and healthy
relationship with one another but I
don't have to settle for you being
destructive or hurtful me hurt me you're
just now going to do it yes if you want
to actually be in my life in any
capacity we're going to have to address
these things and yes learn it and get to
the solution that we need otherwise you
could be right on over there like right
on over here and the first thing I said
to him when we had this conversation was
I have a lot of empathy for you because
I know what you went through in your
childhood
I know that you went through a lot of
bullshit and that has shaped who you are
now but that does not excuse what you
did to me and my brothers when we were
growing up right laid it out right there
I know you went through shit I
understand that you did the best you
could but the best you could really hurt
me in a lot of ways yeah and you know
didn't go super well from there but the
important thing is that I had the issue
I brought it
Swim gave that grown man a chance to do
something about it he made his decision
and now we have moved on and that's what
had to happen and I have been
flourishing emotionally anyway the rest
of my life might be a mess but I have
been happier ever since because that
little girl inside me who went through
so much is finally at peace about it
yeah closure and that is priceless to me
so if you have ever asked what his
reaction was to the whole of our burden
thing that is why I have not responded
to it cuz I don't really want to talk
about him but he called me back and was
like can you call him back or something
like that I was like no nigga the
moments over the moment is over nigga
call him back and tell him I was grading
papers nigga no I'm not doing that
so hopefully that ends people asking me
about that because I get that a lot and
good luck to you d like I said is a very
very hard conversation but one that is
very very worth having and you deserve
it and super super assisted by therapy
oh yes if you have a therapist
definitely run this about I mean me and
my therapist talked about this for the
better part of a year before I actually
did it
cuz we've said it countless times your
daddy is a person your mom is a person
whoever your guardian may have been
they're people and not everyone is ready
to take accountability for their
mistakes for their fuck-ups for their
you know their darkness or whatever and
a huge part of the difficulty I feel
like in these situations is detaching
ourselves from this idea that we owe it
to these people to make these things
were Eden even when they are not even
almost trying to make them right fuck
that
and he deserved to have this
conversation with his own shitty father
now the fact that y'all never did is
really none of my and I understand
therapy was really not a thing for
niggas you know in the 70s and 80s I
fully get that but still here we are
today with me and my shit and somebody
has to break the cycle and it's just
gonna have to be me I guess it's just
gonna have to be me sir so best of luck
to you man
and I hope it goes really well and one
other thing my momma was like a thousand
percent better than my father but me and
her still had issues you know still did
and I confronted her the same way like
you know mama there was some stuff you
did that really messed me up as a kid
but the difference is that my momma was
like immediately like I know I really
messed up I feel so bad about that and I
just want you to know that I love you
and I wish I had done better and it was
the the reaction night my mother was
like yes I did do these things and I am
sorry and you are my daughter and I love
you like nothing else in this world
you're the most important thing on the
planet to me and I would do anything for
us to have a healthy open relationship
total opposite reactions you know and
that's really all it has to be if you
are this parent just acknowledge that
you fucked up and that you're going to
do better your children want to forgive
you it's so really do like really really
really really do guys it's so
unfortunate how many black men are
trained to run in the opposite direction
of vulnerability and emotion yeah niggas
are just not at all trained to have
these kinds of emotion emotions or I'm
sorry not emotions they're not trained
to have these moments yeah of emotion
with anybody yeah it's like the nigga at
your job fine your girlfriend from
college maybe you know but your children
like when your children are saying to
you at any age at any age but especially
as grown-ups who have the the retrospect
and the understanding in the education
and knowledge to know what the fuck
they're talking about at least when
they're talking about their own feelings
and experience yeah when your kids are
coming to you as respectful people and
saying this is how this stuff makes me
feel and it's been really damaging yeah
there should be like they're just too
many men specifically yep there are so
quick to just write it off and you're
wrong and I'm not trying to hear it and
I know it's because men are just not
trained to handle that type of stuff
it's just like your brain go haywire and
you're like what do I do yeah my child
is talking to me in a way that makes me
uncomfortable they must be bad this is
all your fault yeah like
okay well I guess I mean he has not
reached out to me at all so I guess he's
still in his feelings about it I don't
know and probably will never know
because again I had to be the advocate
that I needed I could not be more
worried about his feelings or you know
this bullshit you must respect your
parents no matter what mentality that a
lot of us have I don't owe anybody
respect especially somebody who does not
respect me this is not going to work
you're not gonna be able to just shit on
me and do whatever to hurt me and I have
to just unconditionally pour this
respect back into you no no no no that
is a fucked up relationship and
something that needs to be addressed
Oh respect anybody no it's not even a
parable about yourself not even yo
grandma who they are not you and you
know how black people are about that
grandmas help me mal can get it to her
too she can get it anybody nobody is
safe from you when it comes to
protecting yours she deserves it then
give it to ass all right
that wraps up the super fun and cheerful
question this week send your questions
to ask the Reta gmail.com we'll be right
back
woo girl well lots of discussion about
therapy as usual speaking of make sure
that you get into talk space if you're

same amount as a single face-to-face

you're going through you are not alone
so you can join more than 1 million
people who feel happier when they are
talking with someone on talk space yes
y'all know I love talk space my talk
space therapist helped me so much and
actually got me to the place where I
felt comfortable going back to
traditional therapy but honestly the
best thing about
was that I couldn't let all my feelings
out as much as I wanted to and you know
depending on the plan I had the number
of times that she would come back in and
check in that just depended on the plan
but I could let it out as much as I
wanted to on the app on the laptop it
didn't really matter and she just I just
can't even tell y'all how great it is to
talk to a qualified professional who is
not biased in any way and who just wants
you to be happy again talk space has
more than 5,000 licensed therapists who

finish the show things are being clean
the things I've thought to myself in a
showering a few weeks ago people watch
the legs that mean they also watch the
bottom of their you know they don't and
have you ever seen the bottom of why he
was all kind of debris down there
well no just a yellow underfoot oh my
god I don't know why y'all are like I
remember what this was I was in the
shower and I was watching some out on my
feet a couple of weeks ago and I
randomly had a flashback to when I was a
kid and I used to get me anxiety I was
like I'm out like when I was still like
being washed by my parents okay like in
the bathtub yeah cuz my slippery feet
would make me afraid I was gonna slip
and bust my head on something yes I
think I almost slipped after washing the
bottom of my feet and I was like it
brushed me threw me back to being child
and then all of a thought to myself oh
wait that kind of danger cuz they don't
do that
sad-eyed after all the natives did for
y'all and they walk around the gym
barefoot locker room barefoot showers
barefoot
I just girl alright so I have two things
to say this week try to keep the concise
okay
first and foremost I want to address
some nerds from the gaming community
there was a physio game that is due out
next April I believe it is titled
cyberpunk 2077 sorry Punk is based on a
tabletop game I want to spend the 80s
that was created by a black man that is
called cyberpunk maybe 2020 anyway
the video game you're playing a badass
in a cyberpunk world where everybody is
pretty much a cyborg and has mechanical
modifications such and such and such it
is made by CD Projekt RED famous for
their game The Witcher especially The
Witcher 3 one of the best video games
I've ever played so in short people
really excited about this cyberpunk game
now the folks over at CD Projekt RED
apparently got in some trouble earlier
this year I think for making a joke that
was called transphobic unfortunately my
computer is dead so I can't tell you
exactly what it was what was the word
you just said again CDP CD Projekt okay
red I think project has a cane and
incense oh okay thank you but I think
that they they made a comment or a joke
that was transphobic and I also heard
something about like a poster or
something that exists in the game which
again is not out yet that displayed
someone that may have been queer or
trans and people for summary yeah I
found it there was so they tweeted
something like as an image of somebody I
don't know who it is I guess it's a meme
but it's like game comes starts at e3
something like that and then somebody
reads tweeted and said I want more guys
and then they responded and said did you
just assume their gender yes there you
go yes and that was that transphobic
joke was then rippled I think people
still run with that joke in the nerdy
game community because people trans
people and allies were like hey super
inappropriate yeah and nothing like you
know trolling the alphabet people as for
called
so fast forwarding to today fortunately
enough it seems like some sensible
people over there the developer company
our publishers or whoever they are said
um let's not be ignorant apologize as of
today I think within last week they
announced that CD Projekt RED this is a
game where you can create your own
character in the beginning and they are
removing the feature that allows you to
choose a specific gender meaning in many
games where you can choose or create a
character they'll ask you do you want to
play as a male character do you play as
a female character yeah now in cyberpunk
instead of that what you'll do is you
can choose a voice that sounds more male
or sounds more female and everything
else you just do what you want okay yeah
I mean you can have more quote-unquote
female hair or body or whatever with a
male voice I don't really know how deep
the character creation goes okay all you
need to know is the all that they have
changed is that you don't choose male or
female everything else is the same
you have a nigga's voice the niggas body
and niggas hair niggas play everything
else and opposite anything you can do
whatever you want the gender option has
just been removed that's the only thing
that is different when I tell you that
the Nerds are pissed they're so upset
because the gender option is gone
because the gender option is gone and
it's like you know basic common fucking
sense so they're you know upset feeling
our guests like these game developers
are crumbling under the LGBTQ agenda and
I guess they're assimilating too
a gay regime that is out to make all of
our children trans gay robot I don't
know what you motherfuckers y'all are so
dumb this is not a problem this is not
an issue nigga if you wanted to make the
straight guy cyborg shooting Keanu
Reeves ass motherfucker in this video
game that you thought you were going to
make you literally can still do that the
only difference is there's no button
that says male that's all you can
literally still make the same not only
that woo
there are several games I myself a gamer
an avid gamer and I would say someone
who is very in tune with the industry
I'm a huge fan of character creation in
games because most of the time that
means I can make a black character which
is still very uncommon in games that
don't have character creation a black
main character so in many of these games
that do have character creation I can
tell you right now Saints Row sunset
overdrive I feel like even Dark Souls
many games that have that have allowed
you to have like a big bulky character
that maybe looks male but had that wears
women's clothes or more female body with
facial hair or a nigga with breasts
so whatever but the thing is and most of
those games it's been treated as like
jokey-joke and funny and so you get to
laugh at this rather than it being a
feature that is not meant to be a joke
okay you don't mean yeah but this idea
of just removing gender options from
character creation it's not brand
fucking new and again you can still make
the fucking character that you thought
you were going to make in the first two
- so I don't even understand why you're
upset besides the fact that you just
hate the fact that people who don't
identify as
this heterosexual or whatever the fuck
can feel further included in this game
is that they're paying for as well
that's what you're really upset about
not to mention we're talking about a
game that existed in the future where
motherfuckers like the norm 99 if not
100% of these motherfuckers in this game
have modified themselves mmm-hmm to have
like technological mechanical parts
you're gonna be building motherfuckers
they have claws that come out of their
hands and can see through walls and have
no lower jaw because it's just robots
and they don't have eyeballs they're
just lasers and all of that stuff so you
are okay with a make-believe game that
blurs the lines on humanity but somehow
we can feel like god bless y'all when
you actually play this game because god
only knows what the fuck you're going to
see but again your one and zero pyramid
motherfucking fake person that you're
going to make in this game can still be
the bro bro fast and furious Hobbs and
Shaw ass motherfucker that she wanted
him to be or you wanted her to be in the
first fucking place
this is not something worth to worth
being mad about the thing that really
pisses me off there's this be the same
people who act like they're not
transphobic they're not homophobic or
they're not anything else so again one
of the trans folks do one of the racists
do what is it that they beat you like
let me know Marty hmm because if it's
quacking and it's just you know
fluttering wings about and it has a
fucking bill I will call that bitch a
duck this is not an issue get the fuck
over yourselves people of all walks of
life gay black brown purple yellow trans
tall small fat skinny freckled disabled
whatever everybody has the right to see
themselves in the media that they
consume there is not anybody that I can
think of I don't know miss AIDS maybe
mass murderers or rapists or something
like that that don't deserve to see
themselves reflected in films that they
like or games that they play
that they watch so just because there's
no male female gender option or whatever
in this game doesn't mean that you're
making a trans character how could I I'm
not trying hey play the goddamn game and
shut the fuck up
goddammit this literally means nothing
you can still fully make the boy boy
that you want to have so bad or what the
fucking nothing is different nothing is
different in fact you brought the get
through character creation faster
because there's not another box for you
to check at the beginning you stupid
ignorant ass bitches lastly I wanted to
say to Apple I'm very frustrated with
y'all bitches because so it's nothing
for a while it's just I'm a twit and
with the fact that you if you if a
musician puts out a single and you
purchase it when their album comes out
with that single on it oh yeah Apple
just says like oh you can complete this
order for less or whatever money and
then you don't have to pay extra money
for an album a song something that you
already paid for in theory that's great
the issue that I have is that the song
will then be left off of the album when
you purchase it I know a lot of y'all
know what the fuck I'm talking about
alright so I just bought I think
Westerns album Western is like a wrap
R&B; lift group love this yes great so
their mixtape I think Western season vol
2 just came out I'm a big fan I don't
know them it's wstr in yeah right don't
search the word Western but their music
is really good it is so their mixtape
just came out and they had a single that
came out before it called I think night
and day I bought the I bought all the
singles from this record that came out
before it and then when the album came
out I bought it and they don't show up
in the album so you have a literal
incomplete album that you just purchase
it has songs that are then left in
whatever single file
it is an iTunes or on your phone or
whatever yeah I want to listen to the
album the way that the artist intended
it used to be that she would just pay
for the single twice like it used to be
if you bought no you bought the single
and if you bought the album you paid for
the fucking album and that's what it was
I don't know when they switch things
around but I don't like it and also I
feel like before and I know they're
getting rid of iTunes so they've gotten
rid of iTunes they're changing the way
that shit works and hopefully they're
gonna be fixing this as part of that but
before you could just go into like song
info on a song in iTunes so you
obviously can't do shit on your phone
right but you could go into iTunes go to
song info and then just adjust the track
listing or whatever for the song and the
name of the album because usually if
it's single to be like the name of the
song - if you delete that before and put
the name of the album
it'll just throw it into the album and
you can put this track listing number on
there and it'll put it where it's
supposed to be that don't work no more
or at least it didn't when I tried to
fucking do this yeah this is Oh bitch I
know things haven't been the same since
Steve left or whatever but if y'all
don't fix this basic ass bullshit what
the fuck
I can't even fix it so that my shit
flows the way that I wanted funny Martin
it's annoying I hate it fix it that's it
I'm done my readers over whoa okay well
um hope they do get that together I also
have two things to talk about and one
thing that I'm definitely not which is
Kevin Hart and whatever the fuck that
was okay like the niggas dumb and
whatever I said about him last time
still applies okay instead I want to
talk about though your banks briefly who
I think we need to put on the sickest
shut-in list we all know that lizzo got
the number one she's actually the first
black woman to hit number one on the Hot
100 this year unaccompanied she's the
first solo black female artist to hit
number one this whole fucking year so
September anyway yeah well I mean a part
of that it's cuz oh tell Roche
mostly yeah and so as she is you know
want to do when anytime some random
black woman it's really almost
impossible to tell who she likes and who
she doesn't anytime some random black
woman accomplishes something she has to
weigh in on Instagram because of course
Twitter kicked her ass off the platform
and she talked about you know
Lizza wearing outfits that show her
cellulite and called her millennial
mammy I think she went I'm not gonna
read all of this shit because because no
but she was saying that like Liz Oh
jumps around and act stupid to get half
the attention of somebody like jazmine
sullivan even though she has more talent
than Adele it's like you really don't
have to put lizzo down to talk about how
great jazmine sullivan or adele is like
you could just not ever do that but you
know basically saying white people love
her because she's fat which is just
really not that but just really going in
for no good fucking reason like she
always does and I just again I think
it's time to put a zero on ii don't know
what's wrong with that bitch but like
girl the fact that you are so dedicated
to being miserable is one of the reasons
why all you can do is talk about shit on
instagram now and pray that the gay
still give a fuck every time you put out
another Ernst Ernst record that is
exactly why you wondering what happened
to a zoo Eubanks and her rising star
Azealia Banks did and a zoo your banks
needs to get out her own fucking way
maybe worry more about repairing
relationships and putting out good music
then shitting on another black artist
who didn't do nothing to you but shine
that's never gonna happen
wish it would really wish you would take
care of whatever you got going on girl I
don't know if this mental health I don't
know if it's something else no it is it
is sincerely mental health meds all of
those things and it's like furfrou
the thing is there is them there's being
aware of it there's acknowledging it and
and making the decision to treat it yep
for your good and for everybody
surrounding you and there's knowing it
acknowledging it and being like fuck it
right the main thing is just the reason
behind it but it does not excuse it or
justify it this is dumb
so like bitch please get your fucking
stuff together because we have an issue
with every girl that like does well is
just minding her but I just can't
imagine what the whoo kit I don't get
her even giving a semblance of a fucker
I mean I doubt she acknowledged it at
all which she absolutely shouldn't
because everybody has been
congratulating her even Nikki sent out
like congratulations loser oh you're so
fucking talented yes I don't know what's
wrong with Isaiah but she really needs
to get her shit together
okay well alright I am also going to
pass my read this week because this one
was so good and also put me on to an
issue I didn't know anything about do
you know who worthy is on Instagram I
don't think so so her Instagram name is
worthy but the oh is a V instead and
this came from Whitney B she invented
the trap tutorial method of like makeup
and stuff have you you probably don't
know what that is either the trapped
Orioles are great I've seen them like
I've seen this girl's videos a lot but I
never knew like that she had a whole
Instagram oh yeah I ran around it and so
I'm just gonna let Whitney be explain
what happened
alright and I'm pretty sure she quotes
you at the beginning when she said I'd
like to start this read with an iconic
quote from from an iconic bad bitch it's
like every time we get something here
y'all come trying to steal it putting
some blonde hair on it and calling it
something different
sounds like AK if your original bad on
I'm not sure us
this morning Whitney continues as I was
perusing my Instagram the other day I
came across one of the beauty black
influences I follow worthy she reposted
a well-known white influencer man emu I
don't know who that is but I've heard of
him okay doing a makeup tutorial to hot
girls summer underneath the video
thousands of comments praising said
influencer for his creativity and
originality the video was extremely
creative I didn't include effects and a
whole lot of hoopla that was
entertaining to watch but it was also a
carbon copy of a tutorial style worthy
created years ago called trapped Orioles
in the post worthy speaks about how
frustrating it is as a black creative to
work so hard only for a white person
with a bigger platform to literally
steal your shit and profit double and
triple what you do she also speaks about
how this has caused her to slip into a
severe depression because as a
dark-skinned girl who created the
trapped Oriole style for other
dark-skinned girls she now feels
invisible again who hurt and other black
creatives who are constantly breaking
their necks trying to make a name for
yourself but seldom recognized I see you
you are important you are we are behind
you and you will receive your credit
this makes for not once not twice but
thrice in the past week I've seen yet
another white person quote inventing
something that black people have been
doing forever for youth even a Spica
Becca's knuckled recognize what is
seasoning head ass colonizing ass
bitches we're fuckin tired Holly aren't
you tired Kyle stop playing with our
shit bitch while imitation is the
highest form of flattery it doesn't
count when what you're doing is a part
of the erasure of marginalized people
stop pretending to invent the wheel
dumbass you are not low you did not come
up with this on your own Paul and that's
okay give credit where it's due it would
have taken you all of 3.2 raggedy-ass
seconds to tag the person who inspired
you it doesn't it's so easy instead of
instead you'd rather use your ass dusted
digits and write 22 characters to thank
the girls for enjoying your sickening
ideas bitch the jig is fucking up also
to the beauty brands gagging in this
man's comments you are part of the
problem as well
y'all are quick to use any and every bit
of slang that black films create but
don't have no one on your marketing team
darker than sand beige
when DS girl are you really having a hot
girl summer probably not bitch because I
thought you paid mega for that shit fuck
you and that Baconator hoe pay black
creators hire black people to your team
promote black creatives or kiss our
black asses and that's that own that
love Whitney
Thank You Whitney for this for bringing
this to my attention because again I had
seen this girl in her tribe tutorials
and I had no idea that white makeup
artists were still in this style but I'm
not because it's insanely popular
because she's so good at it like the
amount of editing that goes into the
videos this girl does like I just don't
have talent nowhere close to that and so
thank you Whitney for writing this in
and hopefully us talking about this on
the show helps to boost worthies
visibility a little bit more because she
deserves credit for the things she
creates she's gorgeous she really is
she's a beautiful girl she sells flat
tummy tea on her Instagram but you know
maybe that's what you have to do to pay
the bills when people aren't recognizing
you and crediting you and paying you for
your fucking work when you invented this
whole style of like doing makeup and
then making these really cute edits and
cutaways and stuff like that to these
really popular rap songs like she is so
good at it super dumb basic editing I'm
letting you know right now ain't nobody
trying to go through all of that fucking
work just for somebody else to ruin
super super calm I don't even pay
attention to the YouTube I mean the
makeup or beauty community and YouTube
like that I do often watch or
occasionally I watch like makeup
tutorial videos just because I find them
to be fascinating and even just having
gotten basic makeup done for the couple
of things that we'd be shooting I don't
know how look just kill me right now so
yes but I do hear a lot about shady
bullshit and racism and stuff that
exists even just exclusively within like
the realm of YouTube makeup
folk so I'm not shocked by this but
thank you again also for the yeah for
the read because the girls deserve their
credit they really do like we are out
here making shit happen and yet people
just gloss right on over that and do
whatever the fuck they want whoever this
meant let me look up this man EMU a
person I just know the name I can't even
put a name face to it but 4 million
followers yeah girl god damn and the
thing with that is this was this used to
be like super oh shit he is very
talented but damn you could attack this
girl you could is that and for your
audience of 4.5 million that is a huge
boost for her and a lot of people in
those types of positions do that type of
shit because they know that if they even
do get called out for it they got 4.4
million people but that don't matter
because you're still gonna have way more
supporters on your side that will just
defend you into the pits of hell versus
this black girl you know I mean wow he
has his own cosmetics company lunar of
course of course
a lot of big YouTube makeup fuck you the
thing is like if you know that you are
using a style that somebody who is way
who's visibility is way less than yours
and you know they came up with it like
you know you didn't just come up with
the idea to make these cute ass
interesting ass videos with this Muse
you know you didn't do that so like why
not it's very bit like you could do
YouTube collabs because we love that
type of stuff you didn't collab with her
if you wouldn't even go collab you could
absolutely just be that's another thing
that's super common in YouTube again I
don't watch too much makeup stuff but I
definitely wash I feel like more YouTube
channels than TV networks
Wow yeah I was like a lot of YouTube so
and channels and stuff like that and
many of them get their content from some
other video that they watch right but
it's super normal for them to be like oh
yeah I saw this thing on sudden such as
page and I thought that I would try it
out and nobody feels like oh you copy
can be original be normal yes there's no
reason to be stealing content from
nobody on YouTube or anywhere the fuck
else right so you know y'all could just
make it so easy and hopefully I actually
didn't look at his Instagram hard enough
to know if he went and acknowledged this
I hope he did but go follow her support
if you're into makeup and stuff go
directly to the source for them trapped
Oreos that are so popular because she
really is a gorgeous girl and so fucking
talented Thank You Whitney for sending
