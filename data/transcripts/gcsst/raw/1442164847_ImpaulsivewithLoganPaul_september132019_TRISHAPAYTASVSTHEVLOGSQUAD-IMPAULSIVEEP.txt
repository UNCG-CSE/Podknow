I just would like laying there they're fine with it sound like fucking a dead person, it's like sorry wow okay what are you doing try open now and we we could I don't know where he's going to cut in though guys I'm out of it welcome back your pulse of the number one podcast in the world thank you guys for listening watching Buick subscribing if that subscribe button does not have a d at the end of it and it just says subscribe make it stays give her the D give me somebody didn't make it say subscribe in the 1200 strangest things I've ever seen. I'm doing double days now we in training camp and towards the end of the week you know you get more sore a little more tired that compounds you know your muscles are breaking down it and that's how I'll have to wake up a little bit by then that's good that's how that's happening well not quite so we we saw at her and she says nobody else can fight if you're an influencer except for me exactly is Logan Paul undercard November 9th by the way press conference is this weekend going to be awesome Saturday next to the Staple Center I'll have the info in the description want to see you guys there if you know anybody L A based fans of yours that I don't go to that event like they're in LA and they don't show up to watch it live on YouTube I saw the ball between the legs and then I'll beep you if your LA bassfan and you root for KSI you're dead to me imma be honest. That's okay in the front row going like it by the way like the same they're just like some punk-ass young men like like 13 to 15 rules to a by the way stop smoking these are my lungs this is my life I was reading I didn't like I've been so removed from that I've never grow generation to a club with a USB stick and hold it up to someone bro kisses suck on it right now. say Homie real Roto rooters of KSI what side do you think now that we've mended so many bridges from the past what side do you think like the rice gum to the right here right now cuz I remember last year when I saw the look on ricegum say since he was rooting for for KSI without hurting I was onstage just roasted and toasted classic alopecia I look to my right and on KSI side is not other than Brian ricegum gone crazy I mean so maybe maybe him in the face boys are come and come and support the kid down harder than The Boys Are Back lyrics back to Jake Paul vs. Eddie Hearn so Eddie Hearn the boxing promoter Legend who is promoting my Flight Risk a sign of every night at the Staple Center he came out as you guys know it said no YouTubers are going to be allowed on the undercard that's cool I get it he wants to make it a professional fight he wants to bring real fans the sport of boxing have them appreciate the support and not some gimmick event problem is got a little brother named Jake Paul who's been boxing his ass off for a year-and-a-half box on the undercard are there was a co-main event of the KSI versus Logan Paul number one and he was a little upset that Eddie said this cuz they have not struck a deal yet so pretty Prima Just calling out Eddie Hearn who by the way we have on the podcast this weekend it'll go live Monday so I'll be able to talk to Eddie but this was Jake said today Eddie people want to see me fight the last fight August 25th deji and I had more concurrent viewers on the livestream that when Logan and KSI were fighting and that's a fact did more people want to see me fight I don't know but I think the numbers you're also guess that affect is it Jimmy fact-checker because since we were pirate it so many times I'm sure he's not counting the illegal viewership on Twitch on the black web dark web any color web two things one I got to say this that lighting though about that video holy shit to kiss Hearn is betting big on bringing people over to the sport of boxing and I get all that that's great bring the younger generation over the digital age over to the boxing arena one thing he's forgetting is that a fucking YouTubers that are boxing he's biting the hand that is feeding him all of the views and so to say we don't want YouTube is on the card is challenging because guess what you got I know it's going to fucking blow your mind on the fucking card he's a YouTuber ksi's YouTuber they happened to be clarified at 4 or classified now is professional boxers but I'm going to tell you something no 50 year old dude that's like a boxing fan of Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield and she's going to be like y'all I'm going to turn in mostly because I want to see some old fashioned boxing for this one has beat the shit out of you have also do like I think we've transcended KSI Jake and I I don't know who else but we've transcended like YouTubers become a boxer's I legitimately feel like a fucking box now that's all I've done for the past year-and-a-half rededicate your life to something for a year-and-a-half you're going to be good at it and legitimately registered as a professional fighter cleared past with find colors bro you see my job know you have it no one has it's just as fast as any YouTubers I saw one because they thought it was like an embarrassment to be a top-notch boxer on the undercard of a YouTuber fight but like just sticking with Jake for a second it doesn't it doesn't make much sense to me either and that's why I'm glad I speak with Eddie in person I'm going to be this weekend and I'm going to ask him on the podcast I'm just a little bit if he if he if he's still hesitant but he did respond to Jake's tweet and he said gray video let's talk so Eddie Hearn took roughly 6 minutes out of the day to watch a video which is good it's a good video in Jake has a lot of good points I don't think you should isolate YouTube audience especially someone my brother look at the kid on the screen right now that is a real-life villain he's he's one of those sides are taking people on YouTube and watching him win or lose is going to be fucking awesome to be a nice mix I think you should have a couple pro boxers come in but listen if you're not going to take the promotional power of Jake Paul slash boozy or Jake Paul slash Soulja Boy or whoever it's going to be that seems like that seems like a exercise in futility to me it seems like like you're not utilizing all of the advertising and marketing power that you have built into this just so you can say no this is a real boxing thing at the end of the day it is a real boxing but more than that it's YouTubers fighting each other like I think he's a little bit with Benefits me I'll tell you what benefits me wait till Dylan ass will benefits me the most so I will say last time last card Jake fought deji right before I did and as I'm watching him in the locker room subconsciously an only that is stripping me of so much energy. It's like take him somewhere else but I don't I don't care I'm so locked in this fight even for the press conference this weekend Jake goes to grab a party bus like last time like Donna and we locked in Santa Cruz this ain't this no gimmicks this time I'm taking this shit so fucking seriously need to be alone back I remember the last fight when they stormed in after Jake's win it was a it was just too much like I think any any Professional Event I've been a part of our swimming for me like you've got to be in the zone you got to just lock in it doesn't answer your question and Jake makes this video if he were to not fight on this card totally and completely fucks The Narrative of any Jake Paul KSI Jake Paul versus XYZ profession boxer or MMA fighter because I think we can all agree that this is not my last Combat Sports event is Jake like I love this she unfortunately cuz it's dangerous but part of the reason probably why I love it cuz some screws are missing my head and I love beating the shit out of the person is trying to beat the shit out of me or not going to stop here and that Narrative of whoever Jake and fight next whoever I can fight next I would love to become the most viewed prize fighter in the world that's my goal I want to be the biggest exhibition fighter on the planet and I think I can do that what is that what is that what is that he's playing like some like a long game strategic chest where he knows that a Jake Paul doesn't get undercard on this when he gets his own fight after this and then your narrative stays well to Jake Paul's point he had more concurrent viewers than Logan Paul so I think he's going to be a lot of dangerous Combat Sports and beating the shit out of each other with some fan show up here last night you don't know this cuz you were sleeping 2:15 a.m. I don't know if you even know this just to let people know that I'm in fact not dead and I still will show up occasionally the place and I did not drink Still Rock in the silver streak went out saw some weird Antics between Banks and Alissa just all it all the fun La stuff when I did that and I come home and I'll make myself a little steak Bowl it's like 2 in the morning and I hear the fucking door bell I look outside and there's some girl with the Maverick hoodie some dude like looking into through the gate and shit I'm like all right imma give him a pass on ring one I don't want to wake up Logan because he's got to get ready for his training is Camp X go back to my ball like 9 Minutes like 5 6 minutes later I go out the front door I open it and I got to yell and they go and I go I go hit the button one more time I'm letting the fucking dogs out yo and they call and they go and then the door and they were at your gate Dion from that's like just want to let you know I drove 5200 miles from Flagstaff to fuck that makes you an idiot 5200 miles to show or whatever while they're in training camp United States geographically correct broke space time continuum and so and so I messaged him back and I go and I go do like like I'm sorry we love you we appreciate you but in all honesty like did you in any part of your mind think that was going to turn out any differently than it did its 2:15 a.m. don't show up at people's doors doing that and he said to me that he was advised by a conference of higher power advisory and it started to go down the

Did you can't do it like I do can you take it but you can't do that you would do you can't fucking do that after we said no way we right now it's like 10 years like fresh before you like it in the window what's the window and like doing that kind of stuff did you ever think that you would be talking about fucking Burt Reynolds dead corpse Loops what I listen listen listen you said just just not to 120 seconds ago you said you fuck everyday kind of ritual meditation I guess I'm kind of like I'm going to do the personality like I'm addicted to everything I try to make it to it so yeah I have a problems with a lots of things but sex is like probably never want anyone to like what is it love ya fuking doesn't work you just bought the people in the group to go to a sex addict Recovery Group to send a fucking doesn't sound like a good idea from the start to gather and let's just talk about sex like fucking everybody and I'm not even good at like fucking girls and I like all this will work for now you don't pictures of I just like a girl like if that's like where it's at like if that's what I'm getting that day I look okay but I'm not like a trial object like I love that you're talking about that gets harder it doesn't ID doesn't need them no I don't leave the decider that's just its side that's the best quality of vegans that was he was he like fast food vegan prison and like he he was a raw vegan didn't eat after 4 and what intimate lover but not hard it could not get a heart said your hair is the perfect length like that kind of stuff like this Nike when you're in traffic and cause he facetimes you tie-dye yeah yeah it might be circumstantial I'll give you that maybe it's a problem that Kristen Crispin Glover I can't get pregnant what you thought about this. I tell everybody has come and see me because I cannot get pregnant save my life like you know I'd like to try and try and hide so it's because of chlamydia like if you have it multiple times and it goes untreated for a while like it Blocks Your like to play Metallica test done so I'm scarred up and my tubes and shed the most people they can't shoot the sperm through the window before it starts to affect the reproductive system cuz isn't it isn't like one pill and you're you're good and don't ever ask me like everyone Fox Raleigh back in the day I don't know what it is like now but like when I was like no one even asked me if I was like okay well I mean like exactly how does that work do you have to have sex with a man paying you or is it more just like arm candy thing and it's like maybe imply that you should follow to stick his dick in your mouth really you don't you just ask waiting on for the night you don't have to have sex on a napkin or anything I'm trying to look process a lot of the ship that just happened in what the big question that came to my mind is as you watch the growth of the largest industry which isn't you to not NFL. NBA not all that stuff private Snapchat Snapchat by the way just let's be honest porn the question is why not porn why not plant look what I just go all the way to secure the bag just roll your way into fucking porn did the painting like I someone offered me the casinos like $1,000 like fuck that shit like I think I should like your first got through so much in her I'm like okay I can get over it and also why do it's not that we just love Riley Reid as a person look Ashley it's not cuz she's a pornstar she's just the sweetest girl in the world like she is a sweetheart. Why don't you like corn and that whatever but I don't like him I'm so fucking where you like you know nothing I don't know it's just never been it doesn't look pretty to me like I don't like it I don't know I like to have a Snapchat like pretty you know everything's pretty so I like that I like so what's the limit that because like what's on your private Snapchat is getting penetrated. You're most viewed video which by the way this is crazy our sex life 133 million views this is more than like music videos I have budgets like it like hundreds of thousands of dollars of sex life with Lucy it's fine we don't have audio is evolution ice it looks like ya'll just just fucked if I'm being honest by Monday when he could like put sex on YouTube to get monetized and stuff by the way if I if I try to go to your Twitter or pretty much anything and I have to click yes view profile so how come you're so sexually forward what is this come from there's no reason I'm not like if I'm going to start I just I just like I was like I honestly doesn't always like pulsating like my vagina always a throbbing it's very weird I think there is a condition I'm not even funny I think I would I would I would 100% say that because I think there's people watching this that would say that you have like a condition you know like some sort of mental disorder that you on musk should study your Anatomy just got like to find a source of power that just isn't constantly pulsating something in your brain is wired different where you cannot operate in a normal capacity without just constantly getting dick down you know what I'm saying is always threatening to break up with his he like what has asked me like six times was it yeah you would make Jason have sex with you six times a day getting walking felon in Jackson's when he could simply just use Bluetooth by the way go to those wait wait hold up yeah tell me a little bit about his penis injections Ashley told him about it and so they all like go to this place sure I will literally get cash for you or for the guy or for both young and spry you don't need that why does he literally hates me gums on the lower half of his body play a pickup game sprained his knee got some PRP injections he's fine owners all the time so I don't follow all the major gossip I know about this this beef a little bit AKA not a lot to me why the what the beef is between you and the block squad leader against David F1 fucking hates you up like I was pretty I don't know what the what the right right word is here but he attacked him for sure I think what happened to Phil Hagen if an attack is warranted in the attack but like you definitely made some claims there is a huge difference if I wanted to attack him I could attack him and I still have not done so give us some context what what did David do to really just piss you off pepper your chicken yeah I made a response when you like literally did you ever watch the video the video is not attacking you at all I wasn't coming for literally anybody I literally just like hey this jokes not cool if I came there was a threesome joke about Jason and it's like girl or whatever that dick kept doing I told them for literally a year I was like I hate these jokes aren't doing it they stop doing it but David like wanted me out of the group so we can't making it and then I like the first time you did on Tuesdays a lot I was like past whatever he did it again Friday and I confronted them like that's fucking are cool and I'm sorry will happen to get you and I've said this so many times and I was like hey whatever like he's fucking gross Canada's want to fuck Jason I don't want a phucking free sound like that's fucking nasty channels like I don't wanna do this is weird and like it if I need on the Block and I was like that was all I said it wasn't attacking attacking her so many things to make. I think I remember you saying something along the lines of what you just said just now what was it so why why did the Joker offend you so much gif feelings are so I asked him so many times about it and he liked before he met me so I was just feeling insecure about it and I took completely I always told her all this shitt I don't care I literally don't care any jokes but I like. Jokes not cool I don't like it I used to make jokes about David I didn't think I don't like it so I stopped but they never stopped and they kept pushing and pushing and I was like I just made a video and I was like hey that's fucking knock what's gross and then all the sudden it's like he's Jason. Me like two days later have those still been making the joke in the light of the fact that tan is now obviously happily married like sandwich would obviously offend Jake being the husband I mean that that's a real it's a real marriage obviously they don't make the dope anymore now she's not even in the Vlogs and yeah no seems like a bit messy of a situation has everything now he's very clean-cut like you just give people cars Isis Continental sound like sh see David dobrik I don't know what just because you do when you have followers does it mean you were rich like his friends are well-off make a money but like I'm not sure he's could have I'm pretty sure he's would not outright go buy a Lamborghini what qualifies you as being rich I would say I would I would to me half a million plus per year or per year when I'm at wood on that I don't know cuz you know it's kind of irrelevant. Richard having a great deal of money or assets economics what both of you yo I don't understand I don't understand how many times has Spencer spills his water you ain't perfect either coffee boy you kill the whole computer with your phone bill. How many times have you always send me all the time I'll tell you why don't know fucking sponsors to buy me first. That'll give you a lack of money for the cars it's neat freak not only can he cannot afford a Lamborghini Keith whatever you said can you think you going to be able to buy it and will you already have one but fuck I believe in you you going to get rich for the love of God he can afford to eat that's low he's a great actor and I'm so sorry, you know him two years I've known him for five me and Jason go way back Vine days now he's insane and crazy and it's all a facade isn't it anyways whatever he's cool he's fine whatever she's like no no this is what I did sketches and I told you I'm getting back on them on Instagram wait this was awhile ago you don't say Lyin Ryan 14 million views on Instagram 4 years ago who the audio isn't working it's not working I'll try again check your volume fucking so gross I want to see it's not working well looks like we got saved hey I can we just cut around all this couldn't keep it on this and also mybookie read the beginning I was a little little off I mean it's not even plugged in bro Pablo it's not even plugged in oh shit shit bro don't forget to do your homework right and me and Jason Nash I'm home all of you can sit in the same sentence though it doesn't matter to me. Like you made such a pussy that's okay yeah but I'm also if you answer this correctly I'll resend my statement would you kill a man what the fuck he's a terrorist yeah hell yeah how would you kill him like 12 gauge shotgun from the hip no scope Rambo we're back a word back alright new headlights AMX controversial you're not Spartan reacts to what people do an article recently that said something like that you said I tried to hook up with you or something is this this is just like a song a song that's what I like semi viral X people may videos about it like me to call Trisha Paytas dating a pretty high-profile breakdown and I don't know what to call it was a drunken tweetstorm I was your favorite person on Earth keemstar fucking Keller Williams whatever the fuck you hit every what was going on which I met before and I tried this yarn accident and then like I blow the whole jokeri of this so much harder for me like he was in a drunken to return as a meth fucking between and now it's not funny anymore cuz it's like now that I look back at it cuz I Like It by Kanye West and I didn't know the difference until I was like what what what made you want to try match or you just said a minute ago you wanted to try it also not sure I mean if I said that I might just want to see how do you accidentally do math thing it's cold because obviously you smoke meth interested instead of coke was it fucking dobrik Brazilian Washington they're coming down the cracking down and drug dealers now Mac Miller's drug dealer the question of like why someone else was paying for a for something someone that doesn't illegal drug did and I said well one because any time a high-profile individual dye somebody's somebody's going to get in trouble like in and it sucks that only happens when my profile people died but the problem was he sold not the right product so when you sell a pretty like if you had sold them just a lot of Coca just a lot of heroin or whatever I don't think you would be in trouble you sold them bunk product for his own monetary gain or unknowingly and so like I think it's just a dangerous world out there right now never know what you're going to get the most dangerous time ever in all times and we're talking about those with with fentanyl you know it would it be would be crazy to to just like say to everyone listening and even everyone in this room probably just stay away from drugs on its help I don't think it's too crazy to say I had you get off it every time to the point of where I was like literally like compulsing you know any Salt Lake shuttle make videos on that block me on messenger so I don't like involve him so much that I just didn't really feel good pop Trisha Paytas meth video and probably like doing you and I really feel bad that smoke by never I never really what can I ask you a personal question and this isn't meant to be like offencive or or are you sure because you walked in here alone and I don't want you to feel like it's a room full of men hanging up on you there are two women in the room what is that young girl that you okay you made a couple of videos and I think you might think you've removed all of them or you're like the camera shooting down and you'll see it on the floor like Indian style in your crying it looks like if you were up all night and you just let the camera run and run and run and you're clearly distraught and disheveled why do you make those videos and then post them thinking yo that's dope I literally just do it more like someone to like reach out like just like people and it works like someone will reach out to me like people who died I don't have friends they like someone that I'm like an acquaintance with will eventually reach out what is your friend like an attention thing like that's why I'm feeling a moment it's not fake it's like Buckeye like don't know what to do if I make a video really fine it's okay it's building song I always do I always find something wrong with people so like it's my fault like a defense mechanism I don't think any I don't want any human to say I I don't have friends you know what I'm saying and then like and then and then blame yourself for that you know you can't be that bad of a person. I think I'm pretty toxic I was self-awareness is great I mean wow, this is like I don't play with me there besides the consent of making a video about Jason how about call me and I was like okay and then make a brand on the face me included but I never made a video while I was like that slow down your self-awareness so if you know what the problem is why don't you solve it I can't I really can't it's kind of like being a dick I can't I can't take any addictions I've ever had it starts with you saying that you're already saying I can't like you no answer like that but I just I just can't like I have addiction for like for tanning tanning addiction at least you can fake a marriage in my right not officially I mean everyone will tell you like there is a good traits of bipolar your traits of borderline personality but like I've never been like I never got any medication for any mental like illness I'm just here to listen to take a lot to process and I I think that at one point in my life I was equally unconvinced and not convincible that I was ever going to be a 10-year opiate addiction that I had you know what I'm saying and I was I was I didn't laugh about it as much as you because I was I was I didn't I wasn't on the set of impulsive I was in sleeping in cars and I was down the street so you don't have to go and so I think potentially one of the things that's allowing you to cover up a lot of these problems and put this face on and an even in some ways promote the type of shit that you do is the Glamour and the money and the YouTube and the shit that you have because of Hollywood and and I think you're doing yourself and incredible disservice by not trying to find some way to get out of the out of the shitshow you're in because like I honestly like you're you're undervaluing yourself and your ability to be better you really are and your and you're thinking like that this is like I can tell you right now without a shadow of a doubt that 5 years from now if you put your mind to it and and your heart to add the person that I don't know you but I know you have it in you because everyone does you would look back at today and say I was so wrong about who I thought I was you think so that white one definitely don't promote anything or glamorous anything because people know me as being a mess like obviously that's how people know me as being a fucking mess like I have no Talent people literally know me as calling people out having a friend's boyfriend leaving me like I said people know me being in a mental institution is no bueno because obviously I can't make a big like whatever and so I can't do that glamorizing to I've been sober for five years at 1.99 where I have relapsed multiple times so for me I just don't the lights out and it worked for me I didn't like it not happy 5-year sober up alcohol and pills and I was it wasn't I wasn't happy I'm happy in my life I just don't have friends I don't have friends and I'm okay this sounds like a sad ending in my life you know what I mean like I'm totally fine with it it's not like I want to die like I've never been suicidal or anything but I'm okay with like just having a short fun life you know what I mean a Quaker and I do not know what you mean morbid and it's not like we want to die but it's like it it's okay like you know I don't know how to really respond to that other than say like I do understand I and I can I get it and I'm like who are we to try to like Fix You per say cuz it's nothing really broken from your perspective you don't think I've said a lot and they've all heard me say I'm like if I if I die like a loan in the middle of a cabin next to a Lake in Montana and I'm chilling as long as I live a great great great life I'm not at this point in my life anyways not super focused on finding a connection with like woman for the rest of my life granted I will say not ideal right I think it'd be fun to raise a family and I think it'd be cool and a way to carry on my legacy like if I if someone was like Hey give up with all your social meeting all your money for like the love of your life and kids out and I will delete my YouTube did you turn in your vagina to make delete like I would instantly like 100% but maybe not for me you did you don't get clean and you found a way to connect with something that made you happy you would probably attract somebody that sees that happiness and wants to be with it I really am happy while I'm a mess online and I do get really like big bout to like depression I am like I promised you I'd like very happy in my life and 100 on the show on this show 5 minutes ago is it your skewed version of Happiness whatever it is it's my reality and your reality is reality options my reality what keeps men away like a serious relationship away is it just the addictions or what is Sita to repeat that you're that live fast Die Young lifestyle like this none of this is it all resonates with me I've known so many people that have that have gone out at 2218 whatever you know I'm saying in that was that was their intent y'all I'm going to do as many bags as I can in this needle I'm a sniff as much as I can so I didn't give a fuck they wanted to do it is to the Limit and die when they died and that was their lifestyle I understand that last I've been so in tune with that lifestyle myself when it changes though and why I say that I I don't know that I believe in this happiness is if you were truly happy why would you not why would you be okay with that happiness ending somewhat soon do you know what I'm saying like when you want that happiness that you're currently feeling to extend for another 70 years I'm like living a life but my life my life is fun I'm currently on tour right now and it's like the finest I've ever had in my entire life like it's my favorite thing in the whole world so like I am having so much pain like I do music videos like once a month they make my music so much until like it was sad that I won't know you know what I mean but I want people to know like in general like you know if I die I'm like Emma had a good life like I had a really good life like I told him I'm not all the time like I spend money like crazy person like it's fine like I live it up like are you Tana Mojo in 10 years I don't know maybe I am, I mean I was so maybe I don't know I don't know what she does but you know she's probably be a prostitute unlimited wisdom when it comes to town tap out of that one no just ask my brother's wife cuz I take it easy on the take me to buy you going to be like skits and even just the thought of doing that it's making me so happy that he's like going back to that to that frame of mind don't bro me if you don't know me I got to ask what is it like being a hooker what additives are in someone that I was at counseling with he found out he was hiv-positive and I freaked me out I thought for sure I was not like it matters you can think of when I was young it is so much fun what questionable I fucken evening I should not but yeah I was like she would you fuck this one gallon metal jug prices on Sycamore by the circumference I don't know about you guys I don't know why this this conversation with you and I'm trying to think of the right way to say this because I'm usually the fucking psychopath and right now you are making me look like an altar boy and my feeling on this is for some reason this conversation with you today is weird makes me makes me think you are the walking advertisement for why I don't want to do any of the things you do do you know I'm saying like you just saying I don't know I feel like like would you take us up your ass for some reason the way you present at my Godspell the way you talk the way you present the things that you do they like take the glamour out of them for me do you know what I'm saying like this fucking sucks like being 5150 glamorous being addicted to meth is not glamorous like I shove it all those stories the crowd I've always tried to show and this is a new me and so I don't want to preach to and I don't want to come off like that cuz I won't when I was the fucking biggest comeback in the world but it my new way of thinking is like how do I show people that beauty in the things that others find ugly as Sin and I know it sounds weird for me to say this but this is how I've been operating for the past year now like I'm 34 you know what to do you know what I say about that age doesn't matter it doesn't matter unless it deals with with nature have you do you know how long this guy can run on the elliptical I've never seen anything like it stamina but like why do you feel the need to make the things that other people see as disabilities or whatever so ugly you know what I'm saying like I feel like you could easily go the other way with it and make a lot of the stuff be a little bit more exciting like age and Grace like aging is a fun thing or like I'm saying like I mean I just I just forwarded for some reason when you talk about like sex like I talk about open sex a lot but when you talk about it like having open sex with hiv-positive people in like math Saxon how many people have you slept with triple digits I don't know to be honest the triple digits what about me strikes you as some sort of Sex Fiend we have some cells I don't do I don't actually do it okay to slap that

Access what I'm getting at is this is never done anything wrong to me so I took the moment that you make a mistake you can trust here's my question Logan's friend Mike that'll be the title from impulsive will be clickbaited like that I don't I don't disagree with that but my question is this where did you go I thought we were boys you moron this is me Kenny pies using your mistakes right here that's an orange slice friendship is shoulder roll technique I put it on a little like I just have no issue with the guy that's why I'm leaving it but that's what I do want to see where he falls on the on the JJ vs. Logan fight that's what I'm going to make that I have a feeling but here's the thing the majority of all the smart people in the world are leaving on November 10th ready that fights over we all know the fucking result result JJ is getting his fucking block knocked off in front of the entire world to anybody that's out there like TMJ jaw and ksi's going to win your fucking moron do everybody knows that's not going to happen even if they know that's not going to help it do sometimes you got to support your team you know I'm so you can't you can't blame it doesn't make him a supportive friend a good friend I'm just playing Devil's avocados here doesn't mean it doesn't make him a dummy but like you say say Spencer bro say Spencer goes to fight for some odd reason enough to him in another Universe he goes to fight my boxing coach Shannon Briggs fuck now Granite, let's go Channel ruford this is bad example for Shannon lets you see you go to fight the monsters been here since the day Tokyo hours I want to be when you bossed up and you trained for 8 months running for 9 hours a day for that Iron Man you didn't think I was going to finish it though I knew you were going to finish it I knew you were going to win though I knew I wasn't Gone With the Wind but you're still my boy and I love you and I sure how are you you know what I'm saying and and play the clip of when he got through the first segment but I've never seen death in your eyes 5 degrees all the vegan life was stripped from him that was three mile an hour Pace I'm heading up you peed your pants right not on that one now actually impede the whole time that one that you said your password on the next one I like Jason I like it Jason Jason called you right now babe I'm sorry we take it back to break up with me because David dobrik tells you to that's why I asked for like 3 months, Department car for like five blocks away so. grow some balls and that's the problem judgmental people if they disapprove of hooking up with an I still want to hook up with that I don't we go to those streets bigger pussy than Jason then because you know why you're the one who makes the money and is running this whole ship and you're still a bigger pussy been Jason's I actually drop you off at the house yeah I've done it don't you lie I dropped you off I'm all for it I just know I lied there to unlike a lot of his bucket my love for Jason pretty much like I'm trying to backup Jason cuz I love Jason I love me I love it I do I love being oh shit slipper has fallen Jason right now and you said they I'm talking about Jason can you tell me Jason Nash doesn't like me. I'll talk about Jason Joshua Josh back from the group behind us they want to be associated with you guys controversial I get it it's like it's like a it's like a it's a car you just bought a brand new car problem is a car's not brand-new like I just said it's from 1991 it's brand-new you got a little rust on it right that's me I'm the brand new car I got a little rust on me I got some some some dark energy around me still especially in Hollywood lie, I'm a bit feared I'm a person you'll be like Logan we like his constant can respect what he's doing but if we're seen with him right now they're on a great there on a golden road right now and enter to any of that up to come on this podcast my mind doesn't make sense so I love you be quiet but I thought I was weird there's a supposed to say they've already been on the podcast by the way they just did it without Logan Paul like you. So if that's fucked up I thought that was weird turn off entryway great job Trisha Paytas do you want me to tell her can you just tell me what I don't like I don't like going after the Volkswagen from being scared scared myself billy club you might not like this treasure I I I do like them like I have I have like a friendship with them early it's not like the most the smoothest thing ever but like I like the kids you know I don't trust myself because I talk about him like a real sick I'm a good listener steps did I say I'm going to cut it or we can't be there to say I'm going to cut the segment do you say verbatim I get this with him so I'm so specific with the way I speak so like the way you interpret something even that's not what I said is sometimes I get to pick you up on the internet in David's Vlogs asking an underage girl has sex with a twenty-four-year-old man is and you be like we can tear that and covering that up that's also that some bullshit like a question I was thinking about this once we started even the even when she walked on the set I go at what point am I do I fulfill my duty as a Jurassic Park Tyrannosaurus the number one podcast in the world and get the tea in the drama that people want and do the keemstar and just you know anything for my business and my views in my Fallout 4 protect your friends which is what you said you like I'm friends with know you're trying to protect its sides with you in a cup of journalistic responsibility does not stop at just making sure that we don't cut something out there's another part of Journal journalistic responsibility which is making sure the stuff we put out is accurate and the other person's voice because here's why I say the reason fake news exists as it currently does because I'm out certain Outlets are betting on that clickbait Notch fact-checking should the putting out salt platform with by the liver fucking not be done is someone say okay this does not get caught unless it's a lie if you get the things you said are factually correct no I'm not saying that that's how it will roll here but I don't like a very like good with that because I've been sued and I lost a shitload of money and stuff like that and it's not even a lie just unsettling so I make sure like I said it was in David's vlog in a video there's a lot of shit I know behind the scenes I can't say cuz I can't prove I tell the girls to come forward with them and I can't talk for you like you have to say it I mean I'm not crazy about maybe like the most like 200,000 I read a book like an at my ex boyfriend got arrested they're spending I do I do a facemask challenging researchers to build a deep fakes detector so obviously has a problem right I thought it was going to be a little more reaction and I wasn't mad at you Noah create a deepfake detector yeah weather has troubles they're having trouble yeah they're legit dude is the problem you just said that just like maybe three lines okay won't Facebook is teaming up to find a deepfake company I didn't I didn't read the fact that all bro I'm going to be honest and potentially on the podcast might say what the fuck is deepfake and why are they trying to detect it now we know what it is pick me up a check deepfakes my point is also good I said good earlier and I stick with it this is terrible homemade gas can size career please KSI good God benefited from me fighting him and green to fight him last year because I was mad as no one in America and no it's still to this day normally gives a fuck about what he's doing but now they coming to who is Jared a hell yeah and he helped me because I was coming off that just I just so he helped me in a way to attempt to redeem myself maybe maybe said something like that but yeah I think it was a mutual mutually beneficial thing that's funny cuz I think those last two skits that you put on Instagram see if we could come and see Logan Paul skits on Instagram I bet can't do these like get that people do we don't do we do digital shorts big fucking different said if you watch one of those videos and you were entertained by it to a point where you stop thinking about fucking for one second of your day to watch it and I don't want to fucking like that I don't fall Logan Paul what's your Instagram follow unfollow I didn't follow but okay good god dude just so many bots on Instagram to Tricia Reed Tricia Reed fast Spencer has broke but you're always has books by the way Bottom bar dude to Spencer has book bottom part Spencer has booked a storm so is this is Buck.
