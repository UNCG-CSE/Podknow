welcome to angry Americans welcome to episode 25 I'm your host all right off if you're not angry you're not paying attention these are dangerous and precarious times in America times that'll have an impact on our country and our world forever we have a dangerous and Reckless president whose actions will have an impact on our country forever when existential battle that will determine the future and how and if our country continues to exist as we know it in many ways Americans in the Vitamix life America is a street fighter and yeah that's the Street Fighter video game America's a street fighter always has been always will be America is Scrappy America's crafting America is tough and America can take a punch whether it's Pearl Harbor or 9/11 America can take a hit get up off the mat rising up off the canvas back from the brink like the Undertaker or like Tyson Fury in the fight against Deontay Wilder We rise up off the mat and counter with a fireball a leg sweep or sometimes just a perfect block yeah America is a street fighter and one that's had a hell of a run but this year and ever since Trump got elected the hits just keep on coming hit after hit like Haymaker punches from a heavyweight boxer or like bullets from a gun tearing into our body politic punches and heat rounds bruising the face of America and ripping into our flesh every single one taking a small piece out of our life meter like Ray you in Street Fighter whether it's a punch a bullet or Fireball every hit we take takes a little piece out of us some we can shake off some break a bone but every hit leaves an impact and impact that will cut deep and her badly and impact that will Define our American Experience forever these times man they leave a mark that can't be erased can't be undone can't be lasered off as the last few years of nastiness division war and Chaos the ones are serious there ones that cut deep and leave scars that will remain forever some will be deep enough to cut to the core of our being someone going to a brain into the heart and it's a blood and others might be just a graze wound and when and if the barrage of hits finally stops if they don't kill us will start the long process of healing pushing toward the future hoping we can be like Hemingway wrote stronger at the broken places Hemingway famously wrote the world breaks everyone and afterward many are stronger at the broken places we rally if we dig deep if we listen or cornerman and we study the tape if we play it smart and if we follow the advice of our doctor if we take care of our body politic we can recover we can survive the garage heal her body and emerge stronger at the broken places when we do there will be marks on her body on our body politic and on our actual bodies and we may want to reflect and remember those hard moments and celebrate the good ones or remember those we've lost or commit to the future will want to memorialize that time that experience that inspiration that pain that moment will memorialize it in our stories and in our actions and often on our skin these tumultuous times are leaving marks all over us tattooing Who We Are and that's what our guest has been powerful echannelling shaping and forecasting for decades like every guess we've had on this show he's an iconic important and inspiring American and he's one that's left a mark on hundreds of thousands of bodies all over the world but also on our country's cultural body he's shaping what America was what it is and what it will be Scott Campbell's more than artist he's a Storyteller he's an oracle he's an entrepreneur he's an innovator he's a tastemaker he's a father he's a traveler he's an activist he's a true American success story and a true creative visionary Scott Campbell was born in 1977 and grew up in Louisiana from there he went to the University of Texas to study biochemistry he left that world move to San Francisco and plunged into an entirely New Frontier as he began

doing good work and doing good Scots a truly great and uniquely American Artist Visionary a culture shaper and now a business Mogul and he's definitely an angry American and one whose voice must be hurt especially right now I sat down with him at the Classic Car Club in New York for the most interesting interview we've ever had in the show one that will span so many elements of our culture and our world and will definitely surprise and inspire you and attention must be paid but before we get to Scott there's plenty in America that has me angry and has many others angry and should have everyone angry there are a number of stories you need to know about or know more about that are impacting our country and critical ways right now and leaving a mark and we'll start off with a new situation that's all about angry Americans tens of thousands of them all across America as you all know the 2015 collective bargaining agreement expired at 11:59 p.m. last night and we we will inform General Motors that our membership has opted to go on strike this evening that will be immediately following this press conference this is a decision that is president president Jones has said we do not take this lightly this is our last resort it represents great sacrifice and great courage on the part of our members and all of us here at the table and in the plants across the country clearly understand the hardship that it may cause but UAW members have never faltered in the fight for what is right and for what is just and today we still stand strong and saying with one voice we are standing up for our members and for the fundamental rights of working-class people in this nation that's the uaw's Terry DDS GM workers are angry thousands of GM workers are angry Americans and they have a right to be at midnight Sunday the United Automobile workers went on strike at General Motors sending nearly 50,000 members of factories across the Midwest and South to the picket lines UAW Regional leaders in Detroit voted unanimously on Sunday to authorize a strike the Union's first such walk out since 2007 so there's no reason this week for America to be divided and stressed and a new pressure to our economy which continues to weaken and as our country's tensions rise domestically it's not getting any better internationally just when you thought John Bolton was out and things might settle down the Middle East around his training again and again we're on the edge of War the Trump Administration intensified focus on her on this week claiming that the likely culprit behind a tax on some important Saudi Arabian oil facilities over the weekend official cited intelligence estimates to support the accusation and President Trump's warning that he was prepared to take military action the government release satellite photo showing What official said was 17 points of impact at several Saturday energy facilities from strikes they said came from the North or Northwest that would be consistent with an attack coming from the direction of the Persian Gulf Iran or Iraq rather than from Yemen for the iranian-backed houthi militia claimed responsibility for the strikes operates but here's what Trump at it but if you still think it's the responsibility of the Saudis to defend themselves responsibility of them to do a big a big deal of the defense circling I also think it's the responsibility of The Saturdays to somebody like us which other ones are going to help them they I know that monetarily will be very much involved in paying for this this is something that's much different than other presidents would mention John but the fact is that the Saudis are going to have a lot of involvement in this if we decide to do something they'll be very much involved and that includes payment and they understand that bully but they're going to be very upset that very angry they know pretty much what we know they know pretty much where they came from and we're looking for the final check points and I think if you won't be surprised to see who did it but America's troops are not a mercenary force to be hired by Saudi Arabia our president doesn't seem to understand and respect that and he's saying we're locked and loaded more dangerous talk in dangerous times and Trump president met him he's not helping so in addition to local stresses you may see if you live in the midwest or South due to the GM strike you may not also have to be concerned about whether your kids are your neighbors kids might deploy door on oh yeah your gas prices are likely to go up to and your oil prices just in time for fall and the upcoming winter just to add a bit more stress to the system and I'm Wednesday night breaking news Trump named Robert CEO Brian the state Department's special Envoy for hostage Affairs to replace Bolton and be as fourth National Security advisor I just Forth Just in his first term as a White House continues to struggle to offer any kind of coherent response to a Ron we have another new guy in the mix and his resume is light to say the least he's a little known Los Angeles lawyer whose now thrust into a Maelstrom of foreign policy challenges none more pressing in the crisis with Ron and shrimp roll O'Brien out the meeting on the tarmac of the Los Angeles International Airport where he was traveling between fundraisers under President Trump's leadership I expect us to continue how we got a number of challenges but there's a great team in place with secretary Pompeo and separate asked for Sacramento California working with that man. I'm working with a present to I keep America safe and continue to rebuild our military and then really get us back to a piece with Frank Foster they'll keep. The American people pass away from a challenge around the world today peace through strength how's that been going so far I'm not feeling a lot of peace and the world's not seeing a lot of strength the hearing big talk and see in America continue to overstretching overreach which brings us to our forever Wars that might expand into a Ron soon but you probably didn't see their continuing a numerous countries around the globe including Somali did you know we were at war in Somalia will this week the US carried out its 41st airstrike in Somalia this year this one targeting all Shabad in northwest of kismayu lower Juba Province that's according the US Africa command but we've carried out 41 airstrikes in Somalia this year and as are forever Wars continue in Somalia this week and forgot to stand another Soldier was killed in action Sergeant First Class Jeremy W Griffin was a Green Beret killed by small-arms fire he was 41 years old and from Greenbrier Tennessee he served as a special forces Communications Sergeant 3rd Battalion 1st Special Forces Group have a Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state Soldier first class Griffin was on his fourth combat deployment current Army Chief of Staff James mcconville he was a father he was a husband he was a son he was a Green Beret and he was an American Hero he was a hero 1st 3rd 7th and 10th Special Forces groups have all lost soldiers killed in action in Afghanistan in 2019 and 5th group lost one in Syria the death of Sergeant First Class Griffin brings a number US troops killed in action in Afghanistan this year to 17 and more than 100 other American Personnel have been wounded in combat in 2019 alone that'll leave a mark on all the families and under communities and that's a Mark that can never be healed another kind of Devastation attendant communities and families all across America busy opioid crisis this week Purdue Pharma file for bankruptcy Purdue Pharma if you don't know is a drug manufacturer largely responsible for launching the nation's epidemic of opioid addiction through its sale of the highly profitable and highly addictive painkiller Oxycontin the chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is expected to lead to the destruction of the company that is most closely identified with the epidemic mostly because of its role in leading the sales of the narcotic pain pills the company use aggressive and allegedly misleading sales tactics to push Physicians to prescribe millions of doses of its dangerously addictive pills the company's move to get financial shelter is part of a tentative settlement with thousands of litigants there are thousands of them and they'll shift the focus to new fighting over how potential proceeds will be divvied up by communities reeling under the bird of addiction and overdose deaths under the settlement announced last week more than 2,000 small-government play next in 24 states have agreed to the dissolution of the company and a contribution from the sackler's that's the family that owns a company valued at 10 to 12 billion for the set of evaluation is in dispute and number of states a box of the terms will they be held accountable or will they walk will it be like the big Banks after the mortgage crisis that got government bailouts while millions of Americans lost their homes or is this going to be different I'll only be different if we demanded and that we must my friends Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family must pay just as so many families all across America paid through ways that I can never be reversed and ones that can never be covered which is something the Democrats know a little thing about Dale of exposing their wounds showing all their weaknesses and most of all eating their own now has a politics nerd I love the debates despite all their flaws and I look forward to him almost as much as football the last democratic debate felt like the party finally went back to a more moderate place at times but this one it's going pretty far back into being notably the left again in the Dems continue to eat their own and Biden had a particularly bad to be looking really shaky and this one answer in particular was bad of slavery in our country this was really bad troubling like that no denying it by Nas said he would pull US troops out of Afghanistan but insisted the pakistanis should provide a basis for the US to conduct counterterrorism because the US needs jumping off point that whole Pakistani point was the first and things got worse for buying this weekend as the Corn Pop video emerged you didn't think you were going to walk in this week here in about a guy named corn pop well here you go diving board area and I was one of the guards and they were allowed to choose a three-meter board and you fell off sideways you landed on the dance of the darn cement over there and Corn Pop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys and I did and back in those days and shot things have changed one of the things had to use if you use Pomade in your hair you had to wear a bathing cap attorneys up on the board one list message hey Esther you off the board. Come up and drag you off where you came off and he said I'll meet you outside my car this was mostly they's wrong Publick House in behind my car there was a gate on here I parked my car outside the gate and I he said I'll be waiting for you is Right married three guys and straight razors not if there's a guy named Bill Wright Mouse the only white guy and he did all the pools he was the mechanic and I said what am I going to do is to come down here in the basement where mechanics where where all the pool builder in you know the chain needs to be changed went across the deep end and it cut off a 6 ft length of chain you pull up beside you walk out with that chain and you want their car and say you may cut me man but I'm going to wrap this chain around your head I said you kidding me he said know if you don't don't come back and he was right so I walked out with the chain I woke up to my car and I had step most days used to measure the straight raise your buying them on the curb getting rusty put them in a rain barrel getting rusty I looked at them but I was smart then I said first of all I said when I tell you get off the board to get off the board I'll kick you out again but I shouldn't have called you Esther Williams I apologize for that I apologize but I know that follows you going to work he said you apologized to me I said I apologize when I'm not for throwing you out but I apologize for what I said he said okay closure straight razor my heart begin to beat again yeah Corn Pop was a bad dude Rusty straight razors young Joe Biden lifeguarding and all black pool and facing down corn pop with a chain wrapped around his fists holyshit yeah his heart did beat again but he's having some challenges and the Dems are poking at him daily hoping or maybe worrying out loud that that heart might not beat much longer so the Dems spent most of the night hitting their own hitting each other on obscure Healthcare nuances that most people don't understand while Trump was smiling and looks like we'll be in Castro is taking the mantle from Bill de Blasio and Eric swalwell as the single most aggressively annoying candidate on the stage it was not a winning strategy but here was Julian Castro you know I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this side of course we owe a debt of gratitude to President Barack Obama. Of course I also work for President Obama Vice President Biden and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leads ten million people uncovered now on the last debate station Detroit you said that wasn't true and Senator Harris brought that up there was a fat check of that they said that was true I grew up with a grandmother who had type 2 diabetes and I washed her condition get worse and worst but that whole time she had Medicare I want every single American family have a strong Medicare plan available if they choose to hold on too strong solid Private health insurance I believe they should be able to do that but the difference between what I support a Wii U support Vice President Biden is it you require them to hop in and I would not require them to opt-in they would automatically be enrolled they wouldn't have to buy in that's a big difference because Barack Obama's Vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered you wanted every single person in this country covered my plan would do that your plan would not have to buy in they do not have to buy that you just said that two minutes ago you just said 2 minutes ago that they would have to buy it you said they would have to buy it by any chance are you forgetting what you said to me when he's going to be in for already what you said just two minutes ago I mean I can't believe that you said 2 minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy you're forgetting that I'm a grandmother who has no money she would help her sister automatically rolls and rolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not if you lose your job for instance his health care plan would not automatically roll you you would have to opt-in my healthcare plan would that's a big difference I'm fulfilling a fulfilling a legacy of Barack Obama and you're not I'll be surprised him that blew up in his face and Trump was definitely laughing in other news on the debate Bernie had nothing to say about Afghanistan and Iraq except to talk about his votes and still tried to portray his time of the Senate Veterans Affairs committee as a good thing new / it was not truth is the Bernie Sanders for the Senate Veterans Affairs committee chairman during the biggest Scandal NBA history and the Scandal that brought down VA secretary Shinseki I said it then and I believe it now about Bernie Sanders I told the New York Times his ideological perspective blurred his ability to recognize the operational reality of what was happening at the VA the reality was Bernie Sanders was one of the last people to publicly recognized the gravity of the situation and Sanders got sfac chairman because as an independent he agreed to caucus for the Democrats they had to give him a chairman spot in the VA I was the only one left nobody would have otherwise picked a non veteran anti-war socialist to be the chair of the veterans committee that's the truth so I wouldn't be giving him credit for being a fantastic Sherman in contrast from the debates credit where credit is due there was the best focus on Veterans I've ever seen a debate stage and it was by Cory Booker I want to switch because we don't have Kratom debate stage we were talking about Afghanistan and Iraq it annoys me and we had a conversation about our troops overseas and we didn't say one word about veterans in our country we have a shameful reality in America that we send people off the war and they often come home with invisible wounds hurts and harms they're disproportionately homeless you hear stories about women waiting for months for gynecological care through the VA it is very important as we as a country understand that we are not going to solve every problem with this outrageous increase militarism and we also make sure that we stand up for the people that stood for us we end our national anthem with home of the brave it's about time we make this a better home for play I was good and it was even more impressive than admirable because he didn't get a question about it he forced the issue in and he nailed it all together the National Security segment lasted only about 15 minutes out of 3 hours and it was garbage every single answer except mayor Pete's comments on the author I use of military force was terrible and this was an important moment for me repeat served under General Dunford Way under General Dunford in Afghanistan and today September 12th 2019 means that today you could be 18 years old old enough to serve and I'm not going to live on 9/11 we have got to put an end to endless war and the way we do it is see to it that that country will never again be used for an attack against our homeland and that does not require an open-ended commitment of ground troops let me say something else because if there's one thing we've learned about Afghanistan from Afghanistan it's that the best way not to be caught up in Endless Wars to avoid starting one in the first and so when I am president an authorization for the use of military force will have a built-in three-year Sunset Congress will be required to vote and a president will be required to go to Congress to seek an authorization because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas the least our members of Congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there by the way we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props or worst tools for his own enrichment we saw what's going on with flights apparently being routed through Scotland just so that people can stay at his hotel I'll tell you as a military officer the very first thing that goes through your mind the first time you ever make eye contact with somebody that you were responsible for in uniform is do not let these men and women down this President is doing exactly that I will not props to mayor buttigieg for hitting that one and four hit in the Air Force flight rerouting shit that we've talked about the past good moment for him and a layup Chan trim it talk about his personal service in a note the only other two vets running we're not on the stage last week Tulsi gabbard and Admiral Joe sestak all of which I openly invite to join me as a guest on this show as you may have heard In that clip the crowd was pretty loud last week too loud and as much as I love a good protest protesters stop the show for a good 5 minutes with no real Slim pack soap debates should not have live audiences it makes her better TV but worse debates every single time bottom line on the debate last week it won't change my the biggest impact may be how it knocked out the candles that didn't make the stage in the end biggest losers who in Castro for that move on Biden Primetime cable shows at Las ratings and maybe Thursday Night Football it was on at the same time biggest winners Cory Booker had a good debate Healthcare nerds they definitely love this and Trump cuz every time a Democrat eat around it's good for Trump and right now the Democratic primary is kind of like the first few weeks of the NFL everyone still thinks they have a shot Hearts have not yet been broken everyone still has hope but that's about to end for candidates and for NFL fans everyone's still rooting for the home team no matter how unlikely especially among Democratic activist and fundraising leaders lots of gay people around behind me or Pete lots of people of color around behind Kamala Harris lots of old white people around behind Biden politics in America is always about identity politics and it's always about race and it's always about class real and aspirational like the people who vote for Trump because they hold out hope in the often distorted American dream that everyone can be rich if you work hard enough or if you play the lottery all you need is a dollar and dream and right now there's still hope right now Jacksonville Jaguar fans and Andrew Yang fans New York Jets fans and Cory Booker fans Oakland Raiders fans and Julian Castro fans XFL arena league fans and Marianne Williamson supporters but their hearts will soon be broken it again go is often does it'll be the Patriots again that means Trump and maybe it'll be the Cowboys again invited but the reality will soon set in in the NFL and in the Democratic primary and just to set the goal post the Democratic National Committee has announced that the next debate will be held on October 15th the New York Times and CNN are going to host and so far 11 presidential candidates are qualified and here they are Joe Biden Cory Booker people to judge Julian Castro Kamala Harris Amy Klobuchar Beto O'Rourke Bernie Sanders Tom steyer Elizabeth Warren and Andrea sorry folks know Marianne Williamson she's out and so are any others whose names you didn't hear also out a reminder Mexico Mexico is out in paying for the wall Mexico is not paying for the wall because our troops are paying for the wall as we've covered here at length the troops are going to pay for the wall through a 3.6 billion dollar cut to our defense budget and we're getting new details about this and finding out more about the impact there's a new report from the air force that says Trump's border wall will actually risk our national security report compiled by the Air Force and Pain by nbcnews details the importance each of the 51 military projects chosen by the Trump Administration to lose their funding and here's one example the incirlik Air Force Base in Turkey the entry control point at the main gate is quote degrading and not properly configured to provide proper protection for pedestrian and vehicle passage the Air Force report says adding that there has been quote a higher threat environment since the US began operating in Syria the report goes on to say security breaches have increased since the base began operation inherent resolve support if not funded the main gate remains vulnerable to hostile penetration in the midst of contingency operations in an increase terrorist threat so we'll find hundreds of miles of a wall in the border of Mexico but not the wall on an Airbase in Turkey great and more reason to be outraged as we get more details Fort Bragg is among the North Carolina military bases that are going to take an 80 million dollar hit the fun Trump's border wall projects in North Carolina include 40 million dollars for a new Battalion complex and an Ambulatory Care Center at Camp Lejeune it also includes a canceled 32 million-dollar Elementary School at 4 and these projects join the cuts at Florida bases that were nearly destroyed by last year's hurricane season and a new middle school for Kentucky's for Campbell and a new fire station for Marine Corps Base in South Carolina that's a lot of people impacted with tattoos a lot of mean dudes we're going to remember this shit come election time and they're going to want a tattoo The Ballot Box I think many of them will be turning against Trump if only for this and just as I've been warning these cuts are going to leave a mark they're going to leave a cut a broken bone or a nasty bruise the kind of bruised NFL players take pretty often especially kewpees but their egos are usually tougher to bruised but there's no QB in the world who wouldn't have felt beat up if they experience with one QB in particular has been experiencing for the last couple years no not Kaepernick he's still a great mystery man and who knows if he'll ever get a shot again but if you're the Dolphins for example at this point why the hell not that would be unexpected but another leadership changed it did happen that wasn't fortunately expected one that hits a leader pretty hard a leader who is just about the last guy in the world you'd expect to get a tattoo Eli Manning so this week it finally happened the Giants after an embarrassing loss to the bills at home have decided to bench 2 time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning rookie number one draft pick Daniel Jones will start on Sunday vs Tampa the Giants putting him through this in this way is just messed up he deserves better nothing the Giants have done in my entire life pisses me off more than the way they've handled this it's just too early for Jones but even more importantly it's the wrong way to treat Eli the wrong way to handle all of it and it's more chaos again the problem is not Eli it's cold Schirmer in the entire upper leadership of the organization the fish rots from the head and I hope Jones is amazing but it'll never change how they mishandled all this and it's just not right and it's not the Giants way people who already want to replace Eli with Jones or like people want Biden to drop out there missing the bigger picture this Giants defense and beating Trump is the priority that is more urgent and more disastrous than anything else or the other Giants or the Democrats focus on the existential threat first or the Giants get every snap you can out of Eli that you don't sit let him learn let him be protected for as long as possible if he's going to be our QB for a decade there's no rush especially with this question will wine and shity wide receivers you don't throw your franchises future into this mess if you don't have to don't let the Urgent overtake the important to handle it and I'm going to do my job support support my teammates of the Giants do what I can do to help the football games in and right now that's in Daniel and supporting him that's Eli Manning getting many of the things we put on the show over the weeks even in the hard times he lies only the tone being thoughtful and respectful and even now being a help if there was ever an NFL QB who might have watch mr. Rogers it's Eli Manning and even now at the worst time in his career he's looking out for others for the future and for the youngsters and for the team even now you lie is a helper just as he's been in the community throughout his career you may not like his play but you have to respect his leadership and his example and its commitment to others and whether you like sports or not it's been a spectacle speaking of sports spectacles that are bigger than Sports this weekend Tyson Fury had an epic heavyweight boxing class against Auto Wayland it was a fantastic fight gritty and full of heart and one of the best fights I can remember without a single knock down one for the ages and Tyson Fury is a name you should know or will know soon he's a native of Great Britain named after Mike Tyson and was on top of the world as a heavyweight boxing champion before falling into deep depression drugs and alcohol he was suicidal and almost died but he's been on the come back and he's become a vocal advocate for people with mental health illness and injury and he's a fascinating and I think inspiring got to watch and it was an incredible fight the fury almost lost he overcame a bloody cut to his right eye to pound out a unanimous decision over the Swedish opponent and set up a lucrative heavyweight rematch with Deontay Wilder Whalen was a massive Underdog and fought a really gritty and respectable fight three remain unbeaten in 29 fights and retained his claim to the lineal heavyweight championship against a fighter who was little known but gave the big Englishmen all he could handle any end Tyson Fury took the mic to do it only Tyson Fury can do even trade on the special we can check on a picture of Chop Chop brine Jimmy pitaro ESPN on Kevin may I know it'd be very very proud of the performance auto while and just take the great sweet Gloria so if you haven't heard heavyweight boxing really is back and boxing is a sport that shows with taking shots is All About This is 40 pill with bruising and chances to overcome and it's also a sport deal with tattoos. Opponent in the massive upcoming fight is American Deontay Wilder and he's covered with tattoos in the ring Deontay Wilder spent hours training for his next fight outside of it he has spent days under the needle literally if you're coming with them you don't know how much time and put in all my goodness I thought about how many hours I have on me and and Tattoos have become part of his life you got his first tat at the age of 19 a pair of praying hands holding rosary from that one I see how good it made I felt it was like a therapy more than just a style up or something putting on my skin anytime I tell the story of your life or as I like different sayings in my life that I bothered by those prayers include Psalm 27 on his back if you had to pick a favorite one is of him and his daughter holding hands after she overcame spina bifida and I call it the road to success and we're going up into some clouds she was looking towards me to be her strength to get through a situation with spawn the WBC championship belt on his thigh was the last time he went under the needle but he's making plans for just one more once I collect all the girls I'm going to put them all next to each other and the ink tells Deontay Wilder story the ink tells the story of his daughter ink tells the story of millions of Americans and millions of people all around the world the ink might tell your story every tattoo is about a time a moment in time and every tattoo tells a story maybe there's a story you've always wanted to tell an ink but just haven't pulled the trigger on but the ink tells a story and the ink tells a story of America like jazz rock and roll and Hip Hop like basketball and UFC and now like weed the influence of the American tattoo movement has now spanned the globe and this episode we're making a choice taking a shot biting her lip and dip in the needle in the ink and of course we're laying down to four eyes it's an eagle globe and anchor of Integrity it's a memorial to a loved one of information it's a hidden Mark just beneath your underwear of impact and it's a sleeve of inspiration you sure you want to get this here we go this will leave a mark this is permanent this is forever this is angry Americans episode 25 Americans inspired Americans all Americans welcome back to the Manhattan classic car club for an interview I am really really excited about the Great Scott Campbell is in the house and the great the great you are great man and hang on let me get my dad on the line so he can hear this we do that many reasons to talk to you but as I was

thing I always ask folks is what they want to drink and wet work recording this late morning so you're sticking with water but you said something else which was interesting and I think reflective of the work do you do you don't drink coffee or you can't drink coffee and caffeine to mess with your hands say yeah I get jittery and then then in those lines start to wiggle and then my whole career takes a dive I got to I got to keep a steady hand or it could be a whole another line in your right of only when you're doing coffee but yeah no can I have Anna caffeine and so many years that now when I do have it I mean you like on road trips if I need to stay awake I'll have three sips of gas station coffee and it's basically like doing math you so sexy I hear you I hear that's why I drink so much that you're back in New York and you've been removed LA right but how's it feel to be back in New York man cuz you you built the business here you know this was home for you for being over a decade yeah it doesn't feel coming back it's great I mean I Die Hard come back to New York honestly like within an hour of Landing here I texted my wife and I was like man Nova's going to love this but my daughter's name is Nova I was like she's going to love this place cuz she's just like my daughter is built for New York she just heard the way her brain works the level of stimulus she requires like her like sharpness and wet like yeah I was like I can't wait to unleash around this town but but yeah but it's I'm excited go back once the kids are old enough to like ride the subway and stuff like we will have our state with New York again and our kids are almost the same age your kids are 4 2/4 at 4 and 6 months and in a testament to how I was little scattered this morning I accidentally texted you a video of my kid that I was supposed to send to my wife and she was getting on a plane which is not a big deal because you get it right let's do kids learn there's also give oral like I at right let's do it. My life is shockingly domestic it is for me just the absolute best thing ever it's the best pain in the ass ever that like all the cliches are true it it's it's really yeah higher highs lower lows but I'm thrilled to be on the roller coaster my friend Willie guys to his first ever guessed give me a really really great Insight is it just keeps getting better and at the time I had even had my first son yet but it really for me is true every like this age is so awesome it evolve into another level God I love this thing but really you just legally obligated to keep this thing alive you know you're just like like wow I guess it's beautiful I think so but then you know for years down the line that little larvae is like coming home and like telling you jokes that truly brings tears to your eyes and that's when it's like I fucking love this person who daughter in the joke thing my son is in jail. She tells knock knock jokes that are the best thing I've ever heard a guy in the planes Movie that that that always says like and that's become actually the funniest thing my son does he tries to do his portrayal of the Chupacabra the guy who flies around the Plainsman to do you make joke that sound like weirdos run around New York City with a bad Mexican accent yeah yeah still figuring out the structure does other my son whose to I would so impressed at how advanced is sense of humor is cuz he like right like how far I'll be like Ozzy what was that and he'll be like Dad. Fart. It's funny to blame your farts on someone else I was like that's pretty good but your kids are growing up around two amazingly talented artist and one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is that I wanted to show it to be about going deep with folks who are inspiring important iconic Americans and I think you have really come to Define and kind of redefine of this industry of of tattoo but so much more now and when we were in a downstairs chopping it up a little bit we started to get into that but one thing I wanted to go specific on his I didn't know until we were texting that you've actually going all the way to Afghanistan and we were going back and forth you show your PJ and I said yeah I'm a PJ but Paul Joseph not not parajumper yeah you actually had been with PJ's yeah and then with a squadron 212 a group of PJs that were at Bagram at the time and really was like a little life experience I mean I mean I could talk for hours just on that you know cuz I like I grew up in a happy family in Louisiana that you don't even like nobody would like like I never understood why people would go to war when people would enlist I had an uncle who was a Navy SEAL it during the Vietnam you know what he was fucked up from it for my whole childhood you know I just remember he was like a severe alcoholic in like had really you know I had like rage issues and you know whenever it is like oh it's like you know what kind of like alluded to this like big thing he went through that but I never knew it like it so it I never really understood you know what it meant to be in the military and and then yeah here I found myself some artsy-fartsy little Brooklyn Hipster kid you know Landing in like full body armor at Bagram Air Force Base and all the sudden being like what am I doing here like I don't even know why were in Afghanistan I don't know any like what why did I think this was a good idea and I was like in the gym just like a guys and you know I went there because you know I've been tattooing for 20 years and when I started tattooing it was very much like a underground you know kind of French culture that was you. I felt very like special and insular another really part of this like family and then I saw it explode into you know reality shows and Mall culture and you know fashion runways you know which like I'm partly to blame for you know I mean like I've done a lot of fashion stuff with you know Louis Vuitton handbags and does not like it but but I kind of you know he was this thing that I loved and I couldn't get angry at the world for loving it also but I really wanted to get back to tattooing that had true emotional value you know that I really felt like I was connecting with people in a way that was used both of them and I had I had done a few projects where I would go and tattoo in prisons I spent you know a few months in a prison in Mexico City working with inmates there and touching them and a buddy and I were like what if like if I want to go tattoo people in the front lines of a war you know like what like I just emotionally want to know what's valuable to them like what what's symbols what language what you know what's going through their head in the way like what can I document on them that will help you don't give them something and 8 days after saying that out loud we we were in Afghanistan and yeah it's so we have wandered around they didn't know like the the Press officer was basically like our chaperone making sure we didn't see anything we weren't supposed to see or touch anything weren't supposed to touch had no idea what to do with me I don't know there's some baggage handlers with tattoos you want to go talk to the baggage handlers okay and then we were we were driving around and I saw these guys like who are those guys what do they do cuz they just like felt different you know I was like there's something there's some magic Juju around those guys who's that you're like the PJs what's a PJ tell me about this and then we'll go meet them and they pulled onto into that the PJ barracks and I mean this is some crazy like synchronicity stuff but basically the moment I pulled up this six and a half foot guy you know like is walking across the tarmac and he literally just walked off set from some like Good Morning America interview that they wanted him to do and he was like fuck you people like they had just hours before come off out of operation Bulldog bite which is one of like the gnarliest firefights to go down in Afghanistan occupation didn't and so the PJs you know where the team that went in and was just grabbing everybody they could you know like dead or alive like getting everybody out of there and I'm patching him up and bring him back and I mean Rodger was still you know covered in blood and guts and and he walked up to me and I just saw the gravity of his experience it like you could just see in his eyes that he was in the spirit world you know he was somewhere else you know and and he looked at me and he looked at you know the officer that was escorting US News is like what is this who are you and my heart just like sank into my feet I was just like I have no business being here I'm so sorry like I I'm a stupid tattoo artist from Brooklyn I am sorry for even breathing the same air as you add any kind of look at Minnie's like your tattoo her as I guess sorry do tattoos he's like yeah yeah that might be good I need you looked at that are like Handler and he was like go pack up their stuff he's coming with me and he literally like brought me into the PJ Barracks hours after you know everything went down with bulldog bite and I just like I didn't leave that building for a week I didn't come up for air I just tattoo those guys 24 hours a day drinking energy drinks and eating granola bars and just like contributor laying contributing emotionally whatever I could to them you know reconnecting with life you know after everything they've been through I mean there is this guy Jimmy settle who you know I still talk to you all the time you know I remember him like walking up with a Band-Aid on his forehead I know you know if I got what happened he's like I just popped a pimple and a little bit and then he walked away and it's like a bullet fragments I just had this morning I was like okay cool like the reality that I'm I'm brushing up against and yeah it was really it was really amazing it was I'm sure important to them and I am I mean I try I am so humbled I can tell you what I meant because you know that those moments of release or you know of home or even reflection really really do matter and the PJs herb you know that be special operations in the Air Force the most elite right there almost like the samurai you said that you had that look in his eye right but what they do is so Elite and so unique it's like in a more Elite than NFL quarterback status or something like that right there so few of them but what they do is so intense and so important and so high stakes that for them to have welcomed you into that was with him short a significant to them as well as to you I felt like the reverence around those guys get the theme among the DJs are they getting like Mickey Mouse tattoos like what it was Noah's to directions you know a couple of them you know like Raj ghat you know the coordinates of of what he had just experienced on his arm and then I did two birds on a with his sons names and everyone else I tattooed the tattoos went in those two directions it was either reinforcing the sense of camaraderie with the people they were there with or was reinforcing the connection with a home they needed to not forget that's another reason I was excited to talk to you because I know that the end of the world of tattoo has it I think a special significance among a lot of folks in our audience the bats First Responders cops firefighters EMTs and often they signify loss right and they want or they want to celebrate life right and end so many guys and gals that I know what the names of friends they've lost their moments and that military experience that they want to stay with them and I think maybe almost more than any other community it has a real real importance especially cuz the other side things it's a way of kind of bringing it with you you and you want to bring your family overseas and you've got that tattoo of your kid's name it's that feeling that there with you in that terrible moment when you're a PJ in a firefight and so you have a really unique insight into that community and probably into so many different communities Inc New York you look during 9/11 I was living down off of Canal Street and I was tattooing and a tattoo shop out in Long Island in Wantagh Long Island which is like half the cops and firemen have tons of of Reno 911 memorial tattoos that year old people get tattooed I think people are really drawn to tattoos at moments in their life when they have big things happening that are out of their control you know be at someone dying be at heartbreak be at the ship that you know those guys went through in Afghanistan I think it's you know when you're kind of being affected by circumstances getting a tattoo can be a very literal and physical way of reassuring yourself that you're the one guiding your own life you know that like you could you could say like fuck like I'm just riding this crazy world wave of circumstances that are out of my control but you can sit go to tattoo shop and be like but you know what I'm going to make a decision right now that will change who I am in a symbolic way for the rest of my life like I'm going to just like carve something into my skin and for the rest of my life I will have that thing but I think it really helps people feel more in control of who they are and where they're going has it changed it all Scott now that maybe tattoos are as permanent as they used to be now if you know if you can get it lasered off does that change it waiting for the picture to the way you approach a dock but it's a little process it's still not like flipping a switch it's not as simple as an eraser it's still yeah if you go to get a tattoo lasered off it takes you know 5 to 10 really painful sessions and you can't help it meditate about whatever the fuck that tattoo is while you're doing it so it almost sometimes I feel like getting a tattoo removed gives that tattoo more power you know because it's like you have to go through this ritual again and again and again around that one's had to I don't know I mean obviously it's easy for me to say cuz I'm covered in I mean I'm like the bathroom wall of some shity bar was like names and phone numbers scribbled all over me you know that I my skin is not precious but I do, I got to check if you're more like the you know that the bathroom at cbgb's I mean this is not a shity bar I mean with all due respect this is but you know but I do kind of thinking it's like when I see people are people coming to town Doja by the time they're such a fucking hate this tattoo like I can't I can't stand it I really just like regret it and you don't like I've heard this speech thousands of times and you know in Reading beneath the service I feel like when someone really hates a tattoo it's because they don't like who they were at the time that they got the tattoo and they want to pretend that that version of them never existed and so you know I don't know if there is such thing as regrettable that there's going to be like this but I don't think there's such a thing as credible tattoos I think everybody will tattoo just represents and unreconciled past have you ever said no to doing tattoo with to a tattoo concept so many times what's that like and how does that go down well now I have the luxury of you know I haven't already lead status now I could say no and there's still someone behind them that will say yeah you know I mean like I can still feed my family and say no to tattoos that I disagree with but you know there's been times in my life when I needed that hundred bucks you know in order to eat and so when someone came with a sheet of that shity idea if you know it's like with any artistic Endeavor I had this like scale of like integrity versus hunger you know in like which which side do I go at but you get really good you know when someone comes in with a horrible idea you get really good at this bedside manner of leading them towards a better idea in a way that they think it's their idea you know you're okay we're going to go over here and you're going to think you thought of it is there a Scott Campbell line at that point of impact is there are you sure you want to do this or do you have a line like some doctors do it's right before you start to cut or not have you basically I'll Draw Something the way I want to do it or the way I think you know I mean I'm not a dick like I understand I try to be acknowledged whatever their emotional situation is that brought them there I realize I want it to represent that but if the execution if their idea what if I think you know what their division is kind of crappy I have fully drawn at the way I want to do and then enjoy going to be like hey you know so you said something that was really awesome and it made me think of this and I thought that was such a great idea that you had and so this is what I drew based on your idea they didn't say anything that made me think about that I just drove my way and I was like it like that one thing you said really made it click and so I thought that was great the thing that you suggested so I drew the thing that you suggested and you know it's also kind of them Saving Face of being like oh yeah that does look better than my idea but let's call it my ID and just put it on me but there's a real psychological and artistic mat Mastery to what you do and and you know that experience of going from PJ's in Afghanistan two guys in prison in Mexico City to Hollywood movie stars I mean you are maybe more than almost anybody I've interviewed somebody who's gone uptown-downtown Elder we're in the truck and everything from like like people who murdered for biker gangs that I can't name to Jennifer Aniston and everything in between you know like I can't think of another blue collar job that's going back to the point you made early and you've been around tattooing as it has exploded around the world it's almost like I know you're like krs-1 in Hip Hop's explosion you know I don't know who they are as he want to pick his but you have been kind of a founding father as this this this expression and this I don't even know how to encapsulate this movement has swept the globe so what has that has happened and specifically in this country giving your roots right came from what have you learned about America College isn't as important as they make it out to be kind of like yeah I mean it it's really I mean emotional value is actual value if I had to summarize it up it's it's that you know what I mean like you think that like Commodities or value and you know hardgoods R-value like real estate is valuable emotional value is True Value like people will pay for emotional value and I've based my career on that I mean there was there was one thing that really make a picture about college and it's usually there was one experience that really kind of made me click early on in my career as to the value of what I do and then I started Tattooing in a shity biker shop in San Francisco called picture machine and and I was low guy at the totem pole so I had to open up each day and kind of clean up after the whole mess with other guys left the night before one morning I was I was there you know I got in there at 11 I was opening up it was set up like a doctor's office where there's a waiting room and then the tattoo area in a little sliding window window in between so I went in there turn on all the lights I'm cleaning up all the Chinese food off the stations that the guys left the night before and you know I hear footsteps coming in and I hear them walk into the waiting room and turn around there's guys standing there I was like everybody like what can I do for you I can help you and he was like I want to get a butterfly tattoo was like all right you know so I grabbed the butterfly binder put it on the counter and my thumb through their you know like pick out one you like let me know and he didn't even reach for the book he was like you pick it he's like I'm sure whichever butterfly you pick I'll be happy with I don't think are you sure you don't want it and then I realize he was blind and you don't long as they're short like I saw I start tattooing this guy I pick out a butterfly put a stencil on his chest and I start tattooing him and sound like what's going on but you got to tell me the story here here's a guy who has been blind his whole life he was born without Vision so he's never seen a butterfly and he's never seen a tattoo but he's getting a tattoo of a butterfly on it that he's going through this ritual and and if you know he went on to say he liked you reads a lot and Braille and he read like you read the story of Papillon you know the like that you know the guy had a tattoo of a butterfly on his chest or butterfly what do you wanted to have that thing and it just made me realize how powerful symbols can be two people where is like he didn't need to see it or really understand it but he connected with that symbol so much it was still worth going through that for him to get and that gives me a real reference for what I was giving to people and and made me really understand like how valuable that can be the people that's an incredible story his amazing guy and he went on to get more tattoos he got like a dragon and a tiger and a bunch of flakes but yeah it was a really amazing. That that's that's really really incredibly much more serious yet cuz I know this isn't just flip an aesthetic underlying meaning to it but yeah so we didn't get like a relation to like what I've learned about America it's that yeah emotional value and emotional currency is really powerful you know I mean it's you know if we are going into it you know I mean the show is called angry Americans if we were if we want to brush up against a shitbag president you know he's president because of his emotional resonance like nothing is totally impractical he's a fucking moron but people feel angry and he connects with that anger and that's where all his power is derived from you know what he just emotionally connect with people and it's like fuck you know the facts don't even matter he's distorting reality with emotion and and yeah so it's like you know it's terrifying in a way to see it like that emotional power abused at that level but but yeah I try to use it for the forces of good I'm glad you I'm glad you took us there because you know another reason I was excited to talk to you guys because your life and your journey has taken you into so many different places right you know you have this gritty background of scraping in tattooing to eat right and then you know soaring all the way up to tattoo and Jennifer Aniston starting multiple businesses you are politically active you're thinking of your conscious you and your wife were involved in what's going on in the world in in and so building on that that point you raised the question I asked if everyone Scott Campbell what makes you angry oh man I mean this year a lot it sounds like how how long is this podcast long as it needs to be there that's the great part about podcast know I think the stuff that really makes me angry is when people capitalize or take advantage of other people's kindness you know and Ina you know the notion that it's funny like a lottery used to make me angry when I was a kid cuz it was like I read there was some punk rock record label I think is Dead Kennedys or something that they called the lottery a tax on Hope and I was like oh yeah book that like you're really like his optimism as a whole is something that I I want to believe is growing at you don't even like optimism is like what I need in order to look my kids in the eye every morning and the fact that the notion that there are forces and greedy fucking you know institutions that literally base their business model on exploiting people's optimism and their hope and their kindness really really infuriates me you know and and I think you know this Administration and unlike a lot of things going on in DC end of the world you know like it's it's easy to shut on our country cuz we're fucking up more than anybody but you know there's like a huge right-wing movements and in Germany right now you know I'd like it it's there's like a kind of global issue going on but I had the notion that they're there is a group of people who still really believe in compassion and in the community and helping each other and that those emotional values are exploited and taken advantage of by people who just see everything is dollar signs is really infuriating I feel you on that. I'm really glad you sure that we were talking earlier about you know your connection to punk rock culture I mention to you that I've been honored to know Henry Rollins who you know spoiler folks will join us at some point in the next couple of weeks or months and we'll go deep on that but you know you've had these influences from your upbringing punk rock this is one of them you grew up in Louisiana now you're living in New York in LA and hanging out like Louis Vuitton and all this no other levels but going back to where you came from because you're such a great American success story like you've built businesses you created you created so many things that have contributed positively to people's lives into our country into our world but going in the way way back machine you started to tell me the story downstairs but I'm excited for you to share it with the audience Scott Campbell what was your first car my first car was a real rat a Chevy Nova is a 67 know that was it was actually more like Fred Flintstone's car because it said the passenger floorboard was actually totally rusted out and at a 2 x 4 bolt across that the passenger had to put their foot on but you could watch the pavement go by underneath you but yeah yeah yeah I mean it's ya that car you know this is going to sound really hypocritically I'm just talkin about composite but we were like little redneck assholes you know like I remember taking that car when my airbags first came out we were like what I remember taking that car and like we went to the nearest mall real like let's find the most expensive car we can and RAM it and see if we can make the airbags go off you know you're just like I was shity little Suburban teenager but but I learned compassion later on people I don't judge too harshly what color was the car so it was just a Catan like Sandy dust like rust color yeah it was it didn't last that long but it is served its purpose they gave me the freedom that you needed you know when your 16 in any car anything that can like you know anything that's better than hitchhiking is great you know but yeah but that now my daughter was 4 years old is named Nova which I really was great cuz Nova obviously has you know astronomy references but it also has like red-blooded redneck American you know value as well and so yeah I love that I've never met anyone named Nova and I've never interviewed anybody who named their first born child after their first car yeah yeah I mean it's it's I wanted to know we have Herald sun to I wanted to name him truck but Lake wouldn't let me she was like I was like come on truck would be such a great stone for Maximus and War and a couple others I got rejected but added on another cool Ozzy Amanda. Osgood for short what's what's harder to come up with a tattoo for yourself or for a loved one or coming up with a name for your kids o that's coming it's a create maybe the ultimate creative yeah. in the same way that I look in the mirror and I actually don't even see my tattoos anymore you know it's like the person will change what that tattoo means you know in the beginning you put all this pressure in a name or what the connotations are but like Beetle one year 2 years into it that like the sound of that name is so abstract and so connected with who that person is that like it doesn't matter that you can name him orange juice and you just don't fucking love them and they grow into it right now I need to find my first born son's name is Ryder and he is a writer I can't imagine the name without him or him without that name of a right or area and it just has come to Define who he is or he has come to Define what it means in the world and there's only one of him and and he's a beautiful and unique snowflake that tells fart jokes and in bad and bad bad knock knock knock jokes but when you when you you know you had this amazing journey Scott where you gone through so many different Industries and you're also an entrepreneur you know you've been the guy sweeping the floors at night and the blind guy comes in to get a tattoo and then you work with Louis Vuitton and now another reason I've been really looking forward to talking to you is you're running and creating a company that I think is brilliant you created Bebo and and I know your business partner Clemente it's one of the ways we first connected he's I think of a Visionary and genius and Brilliant guy that I've been through the know in a couple of years ago and he put the product in my hand and told me what he was doing and I was blown away and I think what you're doing is really really exciting but can you tell the story of Bevo and and what you guys are doing so so you have religion of a cannabis brand we do like cannabis oil vape pens and Edibles currently in California and Colorado and then launching other states soon I mean it's it's funny I when I first started getting into cannabis I was like who is going to be a jump I don't know if people are going to follow but you know like I was like why was that in my wheelhouse but like fuck it like I'm passionate about it I want to I want to do it but now being on the other side of it you don't like I said like I kind of saw and participated in growing tattooing from the underground Fringe basically criminal culture II you know the center of pop culture and and now being with weed where it is now it's like oh it's the same thing it's taking the underground criminal French culture that is super passionate about and translating. To America you know and so there's actually been a lot more parallels than I thought when I took those first steps but basically I sew it in you know when tattooing I found myself let you know I found myself culturally relevant but broke you know and so I'm like wait like here's you like like I'm very Google able you know me like I'm out there but I'm still like my wife is very hand-to-mouth you know sounds like how can I be this like how can all these powerful Rich creative people look to me for Creative like guidance you go in the most intimate it's one of you to one of the more intimate like things that the that the purchase or do but at the same time like I don't like you don't work that I do doesn't resonate Beyond these people's arms or legs you know that it intends and there's a beauty in tattooing for that like I like that it's there's no resale value you know there's there's an emotional Purity in that but but definitely like a bit of frustration where it's like I want to do things that resonate further so I tied then launch the wine brand called saved wines that that did really well you know like it did really well and you know like at that was me just taking my emotional language and kind of like you know my sense of of heart and storytelling and putting it into a physical product and and that the math learning experiences through that really gave me the confidence to to start a weed brand and this was you know kind of before California had gone recreational I partnered up with my buddy Clemente he's I mean he's if if you saw standing next together to each other it's very clear which hemisphere of the brain we each represent I mean I mean obviously the creative emotional weirdo and he's the like the steadfast pragmatic Asian that people will actually load money to an end to be honest like it's the best partnership I've ever had I've never had a working relationship that was so successful and so great is that cuz he really he trusted me completely when it came to creative and really like supported me in in my vision and I completely trusted him on like a strategic Financial that was like I don't know just tell me if we have gas in the tank great I'm good but just you go you know and so we built this bread Bebo which you know I've been I've learned my lessons in in you know other commercial collaborations that there's no worse feeling like I knew I was going to have to put this out there and will publicly and speak about it and there's no worse feeling than speaking about something that you don't actually care about you know it's horrible like something or likes it that you don't really pass about it but it's the grossest feeling ever so in starting that sounds like okay like if I'm going to do weed it has to be I was like what's my most emotional connection with weed and you know I can I use weed a lot in my creative process as a way of opening up but I my mom she was diagnosed with cancer when I was eight and she fought at for 7 years and ended up passing away when I was fifteen but you know and I'm paper I'll tell people the story and I was like oh my God that's so heavy but when I think back on it those years were like so bright and like fun and you know there was such a leavening those years at night and I think about it and a lot of it cuz my grandmother you know my grandmother when my mom was sick she would always every time my mom would go through chemo my grandma would bring brownies over she bring a box of my brownies are fresh kids and then a box of my mom's brownies and this is a beautiful Story I mean really really is it been in and then I was going to ask you explain where the name Bevo came from but it's a really beautiful story please continue with the story about your ear so yeah so like every time my mom went through chemo my grandmother would would bake her brownies and ice brownies and you know my sister and I we both real brownies in like minutes you know like our box would be empty and then we like where's mom's brownies and you know she always kept them in her closet and it's like padlock trunk and they just become this like magical like elusive treasure like Mom's brownies of course later we found out that it's cuz Mom's brownies were full of weed my mom pot brownies was going through chemo and but but yeah I bet like in my mom's my grandmother's name is Vevo so we we name the brand Bevo after her but it really was I mean like those years on which on paper should be so dark you know I remember like and I remember drawing smiley faces on my mom's butt and then like Ido sticking her meds injecting her meds into where the nose would be you know and I remember like sitting on the back porch she don't win her hair would start to fall off you know we shave her head and I remember gluing all her hair to a remote control car and like chasing my dog around with it the house in like making them crazy just like it was so much fun you know and and I really it was never scary I mean I was really fortunate enough to like get to talk to my mom about death a lot and what death meant and you know like she was really open in answering questions with us and you know so that by the time she did pass away it was sad like it was deeply stop it was never scary you know and yeah you know the day she passed away she basically called my sister and I up to the hospital and Status down on her bed and you know ask for permission she was like I want to go cuz I'm tired and I'm hurting and like I I need you guys to tell me that you're okay and you know and we said goodbye that night and then that was that was a Saturday and remember waking up Sunday morning and you know they came in to tell us that she had died and you know it's like we knew it was going to happen but I like I went to school the next day like I went to school on Monday morning and I fell 10 feet taller than anyone in that school you know what I mean like the perspective and kind of that they gave me instantly like I had no problems you know like everything that everyone else in high school was worried about a concerned about like none of that fucking matter anymore and you know we're in a time when it's like I mean of course there is like waves of sadness you know in like to this day like you know I I miss her but I really I was fortunate to like bro from that experience so much instead of being handicapped by a thank you for sharing that man that it's really really profound and I know it will give other people strength and perspective over here it's really her death like empowered me and in a way where is like if you hide it from them and make it scary like a really can handicap them and and so yeah I mean I've always you know I hope that you know first of all I hope I die before my kids and second while I hope I get a chance to like really talk to him about it before that happens well I often ask her guests and knowing that everybody is struggling with something and a lot of folks listening to this may be going through a really tough time to have that perspective from you and to see how you've gotten through it and come out on the other side is really inspiring and I think it's important really really important this is especially because you touching on a couple issues of folks don't talk about right and they don't talk about how to talk about it with kids yeah she's really really difficult just talked to him like they understand if you know I mean like understand everything don't water it down. Dilute it there's so much more cuz I feel like experiencing death and loss of that magnitude it's kind of like chickenpox you know like when you get it when you're young you bounce back you adapt to it you build up some antibodies you learn to live in a world with that but if you don't get it until you're forty it can put you in a wheelchair that's deep man that's true had that that if I've never heard that before but that's really a bull's-eye and that is really really powerful thank you for sharing that too and I want it I want to go for a second back back to be bo because there's an important part of this that I want drugs alchemy that exists between you and Clement right is real because I didn't know you but the last time I felt as impressed when I have something in my hand was maybe when I had an iPod man there was the first time and I know where that was it was in Afghanistan it was in the rock it was in a rock and I and II someone sent me an iPod at the very first iPod ahead of the existing blue my fucking much but there was there is an incredible beauty to what you've designed and people you know you can Google it and check it out and when you have it in your hand if you experience the product is not an endorsement you know this is this is part of why because you got this magic of beautiful design is a rose gold color to it there's your Artistry on it but the function right with this thing works and it's a really nice experience and I think it does kind of help people understand a different side and frankly more glamorous side to cannabis and it may be in the same way you have with tattoos right there was a time when like me of smoking weed was a dirty thing you didn't in a cocaine or in the back and it was for criminals and now we understand that it can help people deal with real your pain and as incredibly powerful medicinal effects I've been proud on this show to be a an advocate for cannabis reform and for changes in policy and to highlight people who were really Paving the way but I think you are at a very forward edge of innovation in terms of function and art and if this really exciting intersection so I had to share that with you because I think it's important and I think we both already a tremendous success it's probably going to be even more Mammoth success and that'll be an incredible Testament to you and it in a salute to your grandmother Into Your Mother Angelica Hale people like a brilliant and and inspire people it's hard to do both it's hard to be functional and inspiring but you're doing that I think that's a through line in almost everything you've done in your work and your life Scott yeah I mean thanks again I'm definitely sending that to my dad but but yeah I mean if you have mentioned in clam like it was you don't having a supportive business partner is something that it's raining like I'll tell other artists and creatives about you know my relationship with him and they're just like fuck I need one of those you know you like I need somebody who just like you know just Believes In Me that hard you know that that will like let me can I sprinkle my magic Sparkle sauce on it and just go but yeah it's been it's been really exciting seeing it grow you know what have you learned about you know you go in the world right now given this political contacts give me the president what is it like for you as much as an artist but as an entrepreneur what's it like to be an entrepreneur in America right now at the level you're at I think it comes back to like emotion has value you know I mean I know I'm not a part of this like crazy I mean it's like my company is publicly traded now you know I had to learn what stocks were and I have time like trying to understand how this all works you know I mean I still like you know I'm the creative end but I I want to you know I sit in on all the meetings and and it's it's crazy seeing the power of emotion in emotional connection whereas like it's really if you can emotionally connect with people like that's currency you know Adam that's what make my product that I mean my product at this point you're like it actually has like a chemical and biological function but you know what what makes a different is that okay so there's in in working with a a business and operation of size of mine now what I've learned is that kind of two ways to approach entrepreneurship and one is kind of like like you see like I'm just side because you don't that's what I know but but it it actually applies to a lot of other avenues as well as at the weed world I see all this Tech money coming into weed where their life and they brag about like their analytic abilities where it's like we can give you real-time feedback on what people are walking dispensary and buy it like what websites are looking to what you like all this like real-time analytics and I'm like cool so you can understand in real-time what people are asking for but then the other side of Entrepreneurship which I like to place myself into is where I don't know I don't do focus groups I don't do Market studies I don't want to know anything about that I want to make something for me you know like I'm going to design something selfishly something that I want that isn't out there and and might be a little over people's heads but I'm going to give people I'm going to have the confidence in people till I understand it even though it's above what they're asking for and so basically it's kind of like there's two approaches where would you, date existing demand or do you go right ahead do go do you put out something that people aren't asking for and then teach them why it's better and you obviously like the easiest way is to give them what they're asking for but but the way you move culture is by giving them something that they have to learn in order to appreciate they trust you right in the end of the same way the blind guy trusted you first in the same way folks trust you when you take them down the street and say I know you want this tattoo but I but I can show you something better yeah that's what you've done here too and that that's been a through-line that that's Visions got in that and that's where you I think are moving culture and business and in in people's lives in a way that that is ahead of the curb when I first got to be bo in my hand the one thing that struck me to is that you know what it was called I think like the Hermes cannabis products or something by it right get her medicine right and I said wow it feels like a luxury experience it also feels more accessible to women right which may not be the intent or maybe the intent but there hasn't been traditionally know a juul is very rugged looking traditionally masculine right and I don't want to get into Jared gender stereotypes too much but it it felt smoother right and it felt it felt different and I think that that's a really important thing that I think you've been able to do in every aspect of your life is is raise it up right and an ad that creative input and that that special sauce that that magic and that's really what it is right that that that I think you're able to I mean it take to get with like would be able to wait like definitely we didn't I mean it wasn't designed for women but it was it was just like what I do whatever I made had to be good enough for my wife and you know I wanted I wanted something that she would use because I feel like she's definitely kind of the the The Taste Authority in my household and I think most women are in the household but when we went to Market it was very much an uphill battle people were like nobody wants this because our stuff it's a lower dose you don't like like you know five years ago you walk into a dispensary in California everything was designed for like how high can I get for twenty bucks you know it was just about like what's the THC to dollar ratio cuz that's all people were concerned with and I was like cool that's not me you know I'm a high functioning adult I love using weed but I I can't get trapped on my sofa for 6 hours you know like and so I wanted something that you know was a milder dose very controllable I mean yeah trust is hugely important in our dosage is very metered so that you never get higher than you want to get and and also yeah presented in a way that that looks nice you know that looks beautiful yeah yeah but I think it's like that comes back to trust as well where you know I knew like a lot of people were new to cannabis you know there's like specially now as it's opening up there's a lot of first-time users then when you go to a dispensary if you see something that's really beautiful and considered and thought out in the way it's presented you look at it you be like I don't know much about weed but I can see that whoever made this is proud of it you know and that's what I fear that whatever level of consideration is put into the exterior it's pretty safe to say they put that into whatever is inside as well. That's why I thought the origin story of your grandmother in the name is so important in the way yeah I'm not going to put anything you know it is already becoming like a new iconic American brand like it will it will become at I think and I'm glad you got into the experience because we started talking about coffee write a lot of weed in the early days and canvas products was coffee you guys but kind of green tea volume to the experience and it was very very different for somebody want me over the calf of the growth of cannabis is inextricable from the growth of like the wellness movement in general you know I think you know weed is is very quickly becoming you know is replacing alcohol in a lot of people's lives because it's it's a way to go out and like unwind on a Friday night in a way that you wake up Saturday morning feeling better instead of worse and I am proof positive that especially as I've gotten older I can't and don't drink like I used to and I don't want to wake up feeling fucked up and hang out hungover the next day when my 4 year olds bouncing on my face telling me kid without me Joker is the worst thing I wrote that is feel like such a dirtbag it really it really really is and I think for me it's a moment of Enlightenment in this country at that maybe is coming at a time when we really needed given our politics given the stress in America the last thing we need is everybody in America drinking right now right like I'm in Granite we drink on the show for those were wondering I'm actually having a Negroni right now in a will have maybe a future episode where we bring in Elon Musk and Joe Rogan and me and you we can all choked up but but I really do think that that it's important for us to think about what's going in our body and what we're experiencing and what's around us and what we value at a time when the stakes are pretty pretty high so I want to go to to another question I asked every single guest Scott and you touch down in many different ways but but Scott Campbell what makes you happy oh man I mean family is the most immediate answer you know I'd like getting to yeah I mean it's it's so many things you don't mean like it it's like in the same way that that seeing people sing people take advantage of other people's kindness like is infuriating to me seeing kindness win is everything you know what I mean like seeing that you know that like karmic retribution when you do something good and it like it all pays off and it all comes back around I love that you know what I mean it's like kids of course I mean these days like I laugh harder than I've laughed in decades just like hanging out with my kid cuz it's you know hanging out with a four year old gives you permission to be 4 years old again and like a lot of the anxiety of the shit you carry around in the state you think matters just like falls off and you're like oh yeah like sometimes just like a plate of chicken nuggets and the sunset is everything yeah man would be a lot better if we embraced her inner toddler you you're so much of what you said today I think is going to resonate with people from so many different backgrounds on on so many different issues it's a really I think it's exciting time to be talking with you about them by we've gotten to get into so many different areas that's a lot yet I hope it doesn't feel too schizophrenic we do we've been on this journey together and the other thing I want to ask you because we've talked about in different ways music is is obviously a huge important to me it's an influence in the show we've got some guests coming up that are going to come from the music world that I'm excited to to share with people in the months to come but talk about music and and in particular what are you listening to right now that's that's that's moving you or touching you were home and yammy music spend I mean that you know I've spent 22 years of my life and tattoo shops so it's like there's there's a soundtrack to everything it goes everyday I'm in a group in New Orleans listing to a lot of like blues and jazz you know Miles Davis and end and then you know when of the teenage years was just you know Slayer and Metallica and then went into a bunch of punk rock angry youth just pushing against the walls around me trying to you know I think it's it's kind of like there's that's like the Arc of maturity is like when you're young you know everything's forced down your throat so you define Yourself by what you don't like and then as you get a little bit older you realize it's actually cooler to Define Yourself by things you do like you know and is that was my path but but yeah so I was like what do my Angry punk rock face and then I don't know and then these days I mean I got to say this is like this is going to be really divisive kind of statement but like I just saw the cardi B Talking Like Bernie Sanders on the kind of car on the way over here and I fuck with cardi B today I really do like she's kind of amazing yeah yeah she's awesome I have absolutely no problem with that and I don't think anyone should have brought I mean I would when I was walking over to meet you and I talked about this in the show reason I have been listening to Taylor Swift Non-Stop and I used it in the show I use that you know you better come down to talk about Trump because I heard that song and I saw the video this is fucking brilliant and you know you go through different points if it's like catering the fucking like Rich assholes like literally like taking her clothes off and by selling emotion you know anybody like promotional value and her words like she's fucking crushing it right now and so and I like that she's using her emotional power for the forces of good you know it it's really a friends to Resurgens best friend is a surgeon is there is there a playlist or genre or an artist you listen to when your tattooing it goes It's So schizophrenic when I'm tattoo I know I generally when I'm tattooing I'll let the client decide because it's kind of their comfort is more you know kind of important than mine and I also like enjoy getting exposed to new things so I usually ask the client to put on their playlist when they come in so that so that I can learn something to and it helps me better connect with them that's that's excellent well I am so grateful that you've shared so much time with me and if folks hear noises behind us those are cars work cuz we're at the car club which is a place that that is also look as cool as they say cars look cool and if you're listening for the first time and you want to see what this place looks like good angry Americans that us we will have video of this interview with Scott and you get to look inside the car club and you will also be able to see this part of the show which is the ceremonial giving up the gifts now I did not prepare you for this but as is tradition on the show we have some gifts for you and I will start with the easiest which is some Angry American schwag emerge okay which I think you'll appreciate is made by veterans made in the USA it's hard to do and you can absolutely criticize the design but hopefully I love it I don't if I I would never criticize it without sending you t-shirt designs if you ever want to do a limited edition Scott Campbell sure we will be all over it and the function piece to mizzen & Main is now giving a shirts for everybody because they're super comfortable and I went with just straight white because you're kind of a basic I'm free yeah I figured that might be good now next it's late morning but it says also tradition I have a special gift for every guest that I am inspired by now I want you to open that soon as bigger words if I knew you were going to like a man on man every guess I pick an American whiskey and I go to very liquor store in lower Manhattan the same one this dude is getting sick of me at this point but I'm probably keeping her business but I pick a whiskey that inspires me I'm like what the fuck do I get for Scott Campbell like how do I get and I had to pick something beautiful and so this is Blanton's It's Made in America but it's got this beautiful a hold of Mike for you this is why it's great for audio cuz you can hear the wrapping paper and it's Blanton's it's got this beautiful horse on top and this lovely bag that I hope you will enjoy that's gorgeous thank you so much you're welcome you're welcome and now and total opposite but also functioning undesigned cuz we're not done with the gasket as is also tradition on the show we started to show around Easter I just want to say I'm definitely not giving him a bunch of weed in New York because that's illegal here so I'm definitely is definitely not giving you any weed and I hope his brother Andrew Cuomo will join us so we can tackle that because it's absolutely not but we want to get Cuomo's brother Andrew come on this show so we can talk about it cuz New York's probably likely to go recreational in the next year or so and that movement is important is out of the bottle return investment in the company's in the cities in the states that understand that will be better off economically be better off Politik we be better off socially and I think the same is true for the program or two steps behind is like the only resistance there is for legalization of cannabis at this point is Pharmaceuticals and privatized prisons which in my opinion or like the two most evil Industries there are you know what I mean like if you're charging people to save their own life you don't overcharge people or if you're benefiting from people being in jail fuck off when there's a lot of parallels that we talked about today but like the evolution of you know the punk rocker as the bad guy to be coming to good guy yeah it's kind of you know a parallel to the evolution of cannabis in America play hip-hop or punk music you know went from this Renegade dastardly bad thing to now being massive Industries it change culture and inspire people and make a shitload of money is kind of like it's like selling it out okay and speaking of the meek the last piece is we started around Easter so I asked every guest these are Peeps going to hold your mic for your are so these are Peeps and their three colors of yellow blue and pink and the question is Scott Campbell which color would you pick and why I would go yellow and that's just my own personal Nostalgia a blue I mean in Psychology class they always teach you that like in in nature blue is toxic so we have an inherent hesitation to eat anything blue you'll never see blue in a fast-food exactly. That's why I think Donald is red and yellow there's no blue because like any restaurants don't have blue cuz it's associated with you listening you didn't know that we're dropping some knowledge on the today but okay so no one and I will come down now. God has got them before his face and he's looking at a low yellow I mean I know I know there's a big movement with pink these days where you know it's like a real man you know like aren't afraid of pink I'm not afraid of pink but I just like the last time I made a peep I was 12 years old and it was yellow and if I eat a pita Pit's to connect with that twelve-year-old so I'm going with yellow I love that I love it I I will tell you that that is eight a popular answer is Sarah Jessica Parker called the yellow Peeps the OG of beeps and you are a guy who is about the classics and it's inspired all of your work and you you dude are are a true American success story a real inspiration a classic in a renaissance man and I've been so thankful for you to you for spending so much time with us on the show today and probably doing that folks have never heard of you before I didn't know your work and Scott Campbell is is is the kind of person that I think is helped shape America's past your shaping America's president and you're going to save America's future and I'm really just grateful that you came in here and chopped it up a minute thank you for having me honestly like I'm so it's so important that anyone with a voice uses it for good reason and and I really admire everything you're everything you're doing and everything you're saying with ya with with audience you have great right back at you all right we're not going to go smoke or drink any peeps now we're going to go do push-ups and and share pictures of our kids but lazy General Scott Campbell live from the Classic Car Club Manhattan thanks for joining us big thanks to some folks who helped make this awesome episode happen.
