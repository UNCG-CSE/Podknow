Everybody takes picture in front of like the this is Nashville graffiti all over one could instead just go get their teeth whitener like the original smiledirectclub let's talk about smile direct Club placed its mission statement democratize access to a smile you'll love imply mission statement we have a lot of beautiful people in our commercials and on our website everybody's got like the best glutes six pack a claim 86 to smile but looks like they're doing a lot more work over the horizon tries now in terms of the pricing if you're usually going to get braces that's going to cost him like at least $5,000 if you like a two-year commitmentsmile direct Club if you do it through then don't like send you these braces that you can update like every month and it only cost one point eight thousand dollars and it gets done in a year so about a third of the price and half the time because even innovative business model and Jack and I are very curious about how is offline and online online that's the key part and that's the element that helps them keep the cost low so smile direct Club is partly like hymns hymns is the director consumer online-based hair loss and erectile dysfunction telemedicine, right so the way they interact with you is they do all the consultations online with a Doctor Who's remote right they'll even send you this like chopped kit you bite into this impression thing and then it sends just like a like a statue or something you send it back to Nashville and he'll send you the right price the orthodontist in this case is so remote you're not going to like meet up at some random place in your neighborhood every two weeks so remote the second part it's part Casper mattress hard offline here and there's the Creator think they call them the smile shops atyes there's three hundred is probably one Nashville probably like 6 in New York City if I had to guess and you can actually go in here and get moldings done but also have consultation so if you're not totally comfortable with like the online model you can take you also have a beautiful like purple store that you can take the before picture cuz end up doing the before-and-after what is the takeaway for a buddies over by the way my teeth are all natural disclosure help braces see I can't say the same yesterday was a failure for FDC stock but the IPO overall was a huge success there two types of investors you think about hear the original and existing investors have been around forever like the metric Apple this year. Stock this week they were treated differently with this IP out the existing shareholders evaluation to grow and on August 20th when we first discovered smile direct Club on snacks devaluation was 3.2 billion. Fast for like a month from then and then on Wednesdays IPO price before it started trading at 8 and 9 billion dollar buyerthree weeks between August 20th and September 11th and that's when the Roadshow happened investors were excited they were thrilled to get their hands on smile direct Club stock tickets to the price by the time it finally IPO yesterday was super high probably a little too high stock drop 28% so if you were an investor yesterday it's tough IPO days are incredibly volatile stocks go up and down you want to stay for the long term for investors who had the stock for well before the IPO two different story for our Second Story general electric GE it's old and it has a huge disadvantage and it's selling 38 billion dollars of itself now this company is a fraction of its former self remember High School in your buddy would like to Knowles and then come back with a beard and like 30 ABS feel like turn them sideways to see that where did you go you like I left it on the white water rafting trip what makes getting at here is that GE stock is down 72% in just a couple years fraction of its former self but it's still a very big dealI haven't bought a GE product it out decades out of microwave going on and what if you are a gigantic company or if you are a country you buy GE staff can we just lay out these numbers here cuz this is why are people sit down for this exhibit a talk to me 70,000 aircraft engines yet two-thirds of all planes that take off including snackers listing of plans right now those engines were made by GE 237 exhibit B 7000 gas turbine featuring Jack like moving a physical cardboard blocks get electricity out really know what they do 90% of the world's transmission utilities are powered by GE Gas campus has their own world we're not talking like New England over this isn't the upper New England market market Upper East Side at Urban Planet Earth exact GE still a big deal why we talked about GE because it announced yesterday that the stuff is selling will raise a cool 38 billion dollars for the kids downsizebasic it's old is transportation unit which had a bunch of trains and locomotives for 21 billion dollars Oilfield Services which makes like that you use for almost 3 billion dollars for college and it's never going to see him selling 38 billion worth of stuff over all the CEO announced yesterday and that's not only a big number it's an even bigger number when you realize how much value G is actually worth if you take all of g e stock and put it in a bucket yeah. See how much that's worth doing it right now aka the market capitalization it's 80 billion so it's selling 38 billion almost half of itself and sadly it's going to use this cash it going to rain is not till I grow the business to build a package going to use it to pay back some debts not to invent something it is 105 billion dollars and that's for those of you keeping track that then it's worth AKA it has negative net worth its raised its profit expectations in July for the first time in like ears okay just before the. So Jack Love The Dark Knight for what is the takeplay for our buddies over if you want to see how old GE is look at its pension program is like cut the train and count the Rings you can look at GE pension pension tension definition a regular payment made during a person's retirement that comes from your old employer as an older company G he's got a lot of these for it's a lot of retired employees must be nice G-Eazy retire 1 billion dollars per year as a penchant and it owes to all of the former GE ears were still alive it was 27 billion worth of future pension payments including my lovely Grandma Martell whose husband my grandfather worked at the lovely Schenectady factory making turbo Schenectady New York beautiful The Citadel Outlets hours the world drag it out takes a little bit of your income and that's a big difference between G and younger companies younger companies can reinvest their profits and growth GE has to pay back tension Nana's pensions for third and final storyUnder Armour just turned down athleisure it's going in the opposite direction. A fat let's not do that that's what I'm basically they're taking its contacts under armours like Tiger Woods of retail used to be legendary had a brutal downfall of us but one another major in life might be coming.now this company has lost its way in the last five years the stock is like literally about half a tablet is stuck is up recently 16% on hopes of a Tiger Woods ask rebound before we we snack on this and I can get into under armours new strategy let's look at the apparel Spectrum your man I wish we had one and why you got Leisure we're talking like vans in Sperry shoes now on the opposite and you got high and performance gear talking technical stuff like sweat wicking hate sweat and I swear talking like Lance Armstrong we're talking the buddy who does the 40-yard draft and strips down to chest compression pants into shorts see the sweat they beat it up and don't let it come back again out in the middle of this next week's by he got Evolution Athletics or you can go to yoga and brunch afterwards friends he was moving intimidate you sweat it's not that big a deal maybe we're here right now so athleisure is the booming booming Trend that Nick was talking about that we don't think is a fat it's at 83 billion dollar industry in her even seeing it in the workplace because work places like Goldman and Elsa comethey're making things a little more casual in a sign of athlete Rue and athleisure companies are making a tire that actually looks like it could go in the office so when we look at Under Armour we've been saying for a while it's a little too much ass and not enough Alicia exactly it apparently they heard us and decided to double down on what they're doing the CEO Kevin plank of Baltimore Fame said yesterday we are all performance and then this is Patrick Chris came in and said we are becoming a louder Branch so they're going full-on me we want to be extreme to the extreme Eunice they're going after what Nick and Jack used to be across in football they could beat up the current versions yes we tried to be as huge as possible in the jetty where to Under Armour shirts you sweat a little more than that Wizkid more sweat away and now we're looking for all natural organic acai Under Armour is saying hey we want more of that we don't care what the trend are going for the hardcore performance gear so they're anti Lululemon so Jack what is the takeaway for a buddies over and under armourpart of it is very Pro exactly Lululemon success wasn't just that it's a premium it's a premium brand thing about Lululemon it's very hard to find their clothing on sale right it's just like the iPhone you're only seeing it really are all Millennium State you're only paying full price now under arm the other hand it has suffered from cheapening its brand with discount a whole lot of disconnects back to the exhibit exhibit B station to get your cardboard up over here exhibit at 90% of its locations are outlet stores even at Dick's Sporting Goods it's selling for 40% off to another part of its strategy it and now it's yesterday it is copying Lululemon little bit it's copying Lululemon by doubling its physical locations to 2,500 stores by 2020 outlet location full price stores with no signs that say like blank percent of it wants to maintain its premium brand just like Lululemon does for the anti Namaste crab this is NickApplejack and I own shares of Lululemon smiledirectclub ticker symbol dimple stockhill 28% on its volatile IPO valuation is almost tripled since its last private fundraising General Electric it's old and it's selling parts of itself to pay down and stand it slow down by pension problems Under Armour announce its anti athleisure Mission it wants to be a louder bread for performance at trying to be a Lululemon but it's kind of ran out of gas on the road but finish the Pod before calling for help credible Daniel we love you for that now our actual snap back here let's talk about Walmart streaming Network Walmart
