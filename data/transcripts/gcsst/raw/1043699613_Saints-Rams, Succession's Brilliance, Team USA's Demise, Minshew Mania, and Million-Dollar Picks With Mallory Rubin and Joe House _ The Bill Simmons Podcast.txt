out of it and it'll all make more sense when you actually hear it but this is an idea we've had seven different versions of this idea and we find it later on this but I'm really happy with it actually probably the most fun podcast for me to do especially cuz it's short he's got to go all in the whole time but anyway fall fall the hottest take on Spotify because that is launching on Monday and you are a promising you enjoy that one coming up Mallory Rubin is going to Mallory's most intriguing Joe Hass is going to come out and talk about Team USA and then we're going to be lead our pics and then Mallory is coming back and we're going to talk about succession which is just on an unbelievable run right now that's all coming up first or friends and Pearl JamI am Ali Ruben is he or she is on October 1st going to be editor-in-chief of the ringer but she does Mallory's most intriguing every week last week was a lot of us were all in on Lamar we tried to warn America something great was going to happen and then something great happened and I think I was the most excited I've ever seen you I haven't known you really since we know each other when the Ravens won the Super Bowl because Ray Lewis shaded I'm not sure what you're what you're referencing in the second part of this is the happiest I've ever seen you from Sports was a special moment I'm the happiest you've ever seen me from Sports was probably the Orioles clenching the AL East which was like I literally brought me to tears and allwhat happened to happen on my birthday wish I still can't believe was real life but this is definitely the happiest any sort of football thing they weren't even arranged as words they are just incoherent really for no reason I was sending you the exact same messages on three separate text threads that we were on one spot I just saw her again I just assumed you blacked out so so I don't know what this is going to mean long-term for him as a fantasy guy but he is I would imagine so you there play the Cardinals this we got imagine he's starting everywhere but I feel really Vindicated though I like the way the Ravens look Granite they're playing the Dolphins but I still feel like what we said last week was What mattered they have created an offense that is tailored specifically to him and all things he's good at and you look great that's part of being a good player and a good team and competitive he's actually a nutviolating the Bad Teacher really truly fully dominating those games and they did that end I think more than even the touchdowns more than a perfect passer rating though again yeah but not mention those things yes that sounds perfect ball looks so crisp did it looks so crisp and sharp it felt like the sound you make when you crack open a steamed crab that was why I heard every time when it is Falls zip through the air to sound that when I post made a Jeni's Ice Cream last night and cracked it open the best bass I can't believe that you didn't get nine pintsthree people eating why I told you I got three pints for me and my two children I said no but there's is what age is early summer and it's hot outside and I have two kids and my wife is out and we all look at each other and we decide we want ice cream and we can't drive 3 minutes to go get ice cream this is our culture now efficiency that's how I was feeling you're using that you're watching yesterday The Beatles movie what's the most intriguing number 5 we go backwards from 5 to 1 your most intriguing people the NFL season week 2 beastly number one of my heart but I'm going to exercise and willpower not Palomar on my top five this week just for the sake of variety when they do the new podcast chartand it's like that hot the hottest podcast but they're all new podcast but like the Staples like this one got to get discounted so number 5 Lil Twist for you cuz you told me last week you know don't limit myself go anywhere I want with us start with k this is Sullivan NFL teams will be interested in the Chip Kelly watch is on folks because UCLA Bruins football is officially must watch Trainwreck television I cannot believe how bad things have gotten at UCLA for chip and how quickly it is an absolute debacle in Westwood now we're call they hired him November 2017 to replace Jim Mora Jim Mora was supposed to come in much like neuheisel before I'm excetera on and on and let's go even the battle in LA right make sure that UCLA could compete with USA in 6 in his final two years Chip Kelly last you went three and nine and so far in the season he is I went to with losses to unranked Cincinnati score that game was 24 to 14 disable Chip Kelly offense but I'm fourteen points and then they lost to unranked San Diego State 23214 bolesta San Diego State and even see that wow Stadium never football stadium program but this is just full-on an aptitude for UCLA can't be the way you start. There it definitely can't be the way you start when you bring a Chip Kelly and then he has a 3:00 and I first year so why do I bring something now because they're playing number 5 Oklahoma this weekend which should be like a signature National showcase game for the program and is instead a game that has led UCLA and this is not a joke I swear this is real to give away tickets to the football game really they are giving away for free tickets to current season ticket holders for a game at the Rose Bowl against number 5 so they're worried it's going to be like half full blast weekend again last week was not against Oklahoma thousand people there and it's freaking it is it is more question is what has gone wrong in time to fix it the offense 98th and National scoring offense last year 75th and total offense so far this year a hundred 19th and 127th toes metrics so that's concerning and I think Jess is alarmingly it's a personal thing when Chip Kelly was in Oregon being asleep he was always able to win and compete including playing in the national title game without having classes Boulder on four and five star players that was one of his great skills with so much about his system is offensive genius that didn't actually matter who's able to make other people into stars in his system just been a mass Exodus transfers and he's so far at least not bringing in eleva Chris is paying for players do you start so he does have a shoe company Sanford place that's good actually wait hold on hold on UCLA is Under Armour school now okay Under Armour deal Under Armour money new uniforms all of that be recruiting class last year was 47th nationally do you know where UCLA is like which which part of the world is in it's always unbelievable to me that the California schools don't get half of all the good players but they usually do like that's the thing that's what makes this so astounding and so we'll go check out a question just as somebody who knows nothing part of what made him succeeded Oregon other than Nikes Deep Pockets where he was really cutting-edge with the offenses he was right people are saying he was a genius but now those offenses are pretty standard now right sorry for being Cutting Edge they're not even Cutting Edge anymore it's just kind of outgrown play football so what makes him special in 2018 what is it is he continuing or able to continue to be on what the original Chip Kelly template was it is because if he's not and he doesn't have two players who were going to be able to I mean floats are in the Pac-12 they're going to play obviously USC and then there a program of an awesome marriage you bring in a team like Oklahoma they're going to have to it like to have a ranked game against Washington State in a couple weeks they have legitimate teams on their schedule all year that's why I was going to stay at Stamford until like days before their opening game this year he had named a quarterback was a three-person competition it just seems like there's no Clarity on what even happening there and then you look at what's happening on the field or not even to the point where are the places where is the Innovation where's the genius genius is Lincoln Riley can swim in his wake Baker Mayfield Heisman Kyler Murray Heisman that's the last two years last two quarterbacks for Lincoln Riley in Oklahoma even I knew about that transferred to Oklahoma and something extraordinary men again opening games against the competition but he's used to being people thought we was going to be in UCLA it wasn't like I promised an old ship is like they were two battles Florida to get to Kelly this happened with the 46 defense in the Bears and revolutionized what we thought NFL defenses could do and then he kind of Road the fumes of that to the Eagles where he just had an incredibly talented defense that was like historically loaded but people thought he was pulling the strings kind of more than the town of the defense heard that it was even but it was really the town's defense and then by the early 90s people figured it out and that was it I wonder if that's what happened to Kelly he's still running the Mike Leach offense and his quarterback we're going to talk about shortly folks quarterback last year was the leading passer in the country Gardner Minshew so it's not like he hasn't been able to see that success right so why can't chip what's the contract you know am I spy by receiver shotgun spread it got people cutting Christ people going to Deep Run pics on each other Unstoppable with it don't have more affinity for a person else at whatever time I have the Titan in there five receivers but the tight ends a little bit off the line stealthily turn him into a receiver cornerback cosplay number for speaking of sunglasses over it feels like it it certainly feels like it from the Jets fans that I know who have already just like oh my God that's not even mid-september yet so that's how it felt just after game before mono for Sam darnold 59 answer points even by the butt instant Jets Adam gase standard a really like a Stunna Shang press conference to explain or really not explain anything that it happened in the game where you said and I quote that's the beauty part being a head coach I can basically do what I want that was in response to someone asking about Ty Montgomery snap count Montgomery how are you going to talk about Sam darnold having Le'Veon Bell getting MRI on his shoulder anything actually consequential when do we think Sam darnold had Mono because they got the ball backwards think a little less than three minutes left down 1 billion to go 40 yards at home for a field goal and they look like an absolute shitshow so then you wonder about his physical readiness I don't know but I think it's one of these Jets stories were the instant reaction on Twitter on the internet was like Lola is a terrible way to derail the beginning of Sam darnold sophomore season but because it's the Jets the impulses to say oh my God like how many things are going to happen to the Jets it's only heading into each year they have their Monday Night Football they have the Browns game on Monday night the Browns are obviously also coming off a disappointing week one is kind of like instantly feels like a must-win game for both of these teams schedule there's a real chance to take a start to your Owen six today after them the Browns went from -3 to -7 people give us the schedule the schedule is Browns this week Los New England week 3 loss by and we are very very emotional to get a brief reprieve early in the season and then it's Philly Dallas and New England Again by the way they might be injured or not sure about him but he would have to go nuts and one of those games have the Jets he looks fabulous and you misuse contract he's her but it's unclear when exactly he'll be back already lost for the entire season first round Draft pick from past Rock when Williams not practicing right now ankle injury in a lot of injuries mounting they had to elevate Luke Falk Washington State not expecting us from the practice squad to get ready to be a backup quarterback for Monday Night Football game that is not a place you want to be and we two and then Gees all of this gay stuff he's hitting Dousman today of the darnold mono illness was so bizarre like even by the Adam gase bizarreness scale standard 14 has mono I will be out for this game you can't say you're starting quarterbacks name 14 hidden continue show Trevor will be starting okay big for all of our divorce is Trevor's and elevated at some point to be the backup so that would be that he concluded then the other thing that happened this week is that Manish had a report in the daily news with a dolphins she broken at the story starts you prefer he was in love with one fell in love with probably a lot of NFL coaches. Baker Mayfield was the best quarterback in the draft that's fine here's the Zinger Bill she reportedly also prefer Josh Allen to Sam darnold and did not quote didn't believe the darnold have star potential so that something is now out in the world and even though it doesn't matter is like a Sting the people are talking about to Adam. I mean I could be somebody just leaking that to Manish just to screw around guess the general tenor around here it's one of those situations pretty pretty quickly. Into that place like again you a box of the way he was talking after the bills loss and just like the line play my shitt the receivers played like shit the DBS played like shit you know he wasn't actually using foul language and Peyton Manning is a Hall of Famer of all-time who's like I kind of like this dick he just says his mind and he can handle it but if you put somebody like that with a young team in the Young quarterback the big city it might not be a bad idea is there a Miami excuses for Miami because the roster it did so many weird things for that it was even hard to evaluate if he was a good coach but I don't like anything he's done so far it's alright with the Jets he just seems kind of like a jerk never forgot that this is a man who once said that the internet and social media are pollution of the brain but he might not be wrong in that I just want to say one thing cuz I do think people under eight it and I think it all stems back to a famous Brady Bunch episode 70s where it became you know it's a sitcom that was one of the formative shows of the 70s everybody under the age of I would say 35 and seen every Brady Bunch probably Kyle I mean over 35 35 35 and over I would say at least knows all the Brady Bunch episodes and that kind of made light of mono and it's like yeah you can actually die from are you get modeling school and not come back for a two and a half months night kissing jokes it's weird to be like Sam darnold might have leukemia I wouldn't be like like really bad it's it's it's a terrible I feel bad for jets fans and I wished it it's not realistic to wish for the Just Dance to be able to enjoy winning football team football enjoyment it's just every year we did what we did a CNA in the preseason like basically the tale of the tape of jets Giants dystopia right now and who had it worse but the thing was there was slick reason for positivity excitement in both cases you know you're going to make fun of Eli Manning all year we do we have a lot of fodder for that already just after week one Dave gettleman if you can talk to me I mean if you can talk yourself into Danny dimes which I personally can't put some delusional Giants fantasy this year was at least we're not the Giants Jets fan but now yeah they're in the Giants could they can beat the bills this week who knows those are mine is too much easier if you have to start thinking about especially when you're the same division is the fish tank is Miami do you text you try to get to a you're heading into an outstanding quarterback draft class and if these Altima is not a darn believer then it's some point I like Sam darnold I'm not nearly as enamored of him as some of the other quarterbacks not draft class but I do like him if it doesn't at some point you have to move on and then it starts to become a bigger story than just the Jets because we be on the heels of potentially to court to the top quarterbacks taken in that draft class 2 in the top 10 teams moving on from them while they were still in their rookie Court bites that conversation pick up in like 5 weeks which would it be for fantasy and last year a really dramatic way I don't care to say that they're sad Jets fans I think that comes with the territory that's like saying they wear green uniforms the Jets fans are just sad that's another thing that they're just like covered in zombie zombie guts just trying to survive the zombies that's a smart move that sound strategy that's so that they don't smell you in when you walk through the football equivalent covering yourself in Zombie got to get to the other side of the fence they are trying to reach do you change an iconic uniform on top of that I really like to chew now not yet not yet wow December 3 Prescott keep it up so much talk in the offseason is always about the Cowboys in particular the sauce used in about the Cowboys contract situations what should a cat be paid what does he want to be paid for the reports about what he wanted to be paid right it was a persistent store and all of the conversation around he's value in his perspective contract Jerry Jones saying then actually extending numerous other players but you did end up getting checks have been generally swim what do you can't see me my time undertale might take you out and you can killed by sharks I would your survey is the population of Cabo doing like the breaststroke in the ocean not as cool of a sounding name would be way less cool yeah I'm going to Cabo swim cuz you'll die cuz you have the shitz for 4 days have fun that's why I take care, where are they at sign his contract Demarcus Lawrence Jaylon Smith Iowa Collins all that and then dad comes out and it has a speedy game right 25 for 30 to 45 yards for touchdowns across the giant I think Dad might be the number one fist pump guy other than when Brady is like really fired up but when the touchdown kilowatt who go toward the sidelines and he'll do like the full get his whole body into it like almost jump in the air. I think Kyle Brady can do it but I don't think he has consistently Stop Believin the ground too often either Brady will get there but I think Dak is day-to-day the best fish bumper and you are you saying there might be a chance to Dak Prescott is slightly more mobile athletically inclined than Tom Brady the tb12 clinic Eritrean dislikes is so mobile mobile 42 year old talks coffee that's a Starbucks run practice is a discount or avocado Thomas like you're reaching for an avocado reaching for some kale has more hair than you did 12 years ago and is faster than he was 12 years all natural. It is for sure is natural what a man or how his hair looks like that sometimes people use better shampoo yeah Federal oil thickening shampoo that must be what it is that's what it is yeah yeah it looks great so deck week we can skip over deck was great in this week Washington's defense is a little sneaky but I still think it'll be great right to question for him is whatever the late Sunday game against a good D they're down the down at 8 right there's like 5 minutes left is that your guy but I still feel the same about your job yeah I don't know if I trust Jared Goff in that situation because Jared Goff has got his contract rights when is Dak Prescott getting his contract question I mean the Cowboys have the most wins in the NFC of the last three years and in that span of time he's he's earned 2.7 million dollars that's ridiculous this year or for a certain number of years in the future I would rather Jacoby Brissett at 15 or Dak at 35 I'd rather have Cobra set of 15 I mean you always have to factor in whether G Minshew at 4 I mean do you think your dad can sustain it that's the question right because of the Kalam or offense for sure for sure coordinator lotion play action letting Dak throw the ball deep which is actually really good at and wasn't able to do before taking advantage of the Michael Gallup glow up Amari Cooper Amari Cooper arrives in Dallas or actually like legitimately better the Angels Wonder Jason Witten back not using Tom Brady shampoo that turns out but well thank you, so here's the thing one last thing and then we'll move on gallup's really good I actually think and I did he's not a sleeper because people were treating him in there drafts and auctions like he was asleep or a huge training speaker was at but I don't think that's ever had two receivers at the same time like this right I mean even he has Randall Cobb in town now and again he's he has to get out of the backfield you can also run premium gas can also run and they're playing behind in a Wii offensive line like he he's never been in an offense this good and you can very reasonably ask what a quarterback skill in value is independent of that but the Wave football Works in 2019 is that you have to actually access the system was just playing this is so that's what you're paying for is whether the Personnel in the scheme can work together I feel the same way about him as I do about a few other quarterbacks I think when they have the lead they look awesome and yeah when they can just play differently and have a different mindset their car was like that on Monday night he had to leave the whole game you know and it and he was able to kind of play it safe and do smart things in take the question for me with these guys is always what happens when you're down a TV with 4 minutes left and I'm still not a thousand percent sold a deck on that but we'll see maybe the most confident that we've had their that we've been able to feel in she was playing the

is going to be G Minshew which one I don't know you tell me Saints Rams Revenge game Revenge game talk is kind of stupid you can't actually get revenge for one of the most egregious no calls in sports history in the NFC championship game which kept you out of the Super Bowl and allow the Rams to go in your place in a week 2 of a regular-season you can't get revenge for the can you get revenge on all the ways you choked in that game as well other than the car can you get revenge in yourself the nine different ways they choked including winning the toss and what a fucking it up anyway including completely mismanaged in the clock in the lead in the Superdome in the first half when it was like Jared Goff and down double figures the game should be over the Saints in week 1 against the Texans but there were plenty of confounding moments that could have led to a different result there the Texans got the ball in less than a minute left and scored in two plays the first show the first play DeAndre Hopkins is somehow open he's the best receiver in the entire league is open by 2 yards and then the second play they're blitzing they're blitzing Watson for some reason there's like 40 seconds that they don't have timeouts and just had Stills right down the middle of field either I was confounded it the end of the day they won huge like 50 yard field goal right as time expired that and then as soon as Bill O'Brien was given a cancer that's when you Blitz here's the thing about Bill O'Brien definitely shouldn't be making decisions as a de-facto GM right now and also probably shouldn't be a head football coach in the NFL other than those two things are fine okay the inherent premises slightly flawed the glory of being a sports fan is that feels real and it feels really the players to clearly because the narrative heading into this game the tension and the energy right he's really palpable that's a cool and kind of rare thing for week too so it's in LA the Saints coming in as the road team they got all this meant talk that they're caring with them still this is a thing we'll never forget any of the Rams on the other side bitterly about this this weekend on Wednesday all of these reporters were huddled around Robey Coleman Locker ask him about the play he was obviously the defensive backs a strong enough word busy blatant pass interference wasn't called led to rule change in NFL rule change address or ask him and Sean McVay walks by and shouts how many times can you ask the same question so the teams are processing this in a totally different way the scenes want to talk about it because it's fuel for them and the Rams can't wait to move on to leave that's a New Orleans problem it's not an l a problem I just love this shitt fuel to them to be a bad thing that I just think this is good advice to have in life and there's been a couple times in my life where I wish I had just gone forward and that weld on something that happened in backwards and it does seem like they've dwelled a lot on the back roads this season and that was what one of the reasons why I didn't like them in that mission unfortunately for that prediction their division sucks and the Panthers I don't think cam completed a pass now he's by other so run before the game tonight but yeah I came just doesn't look the same to me as a coaching and pull things back on it but did his usual Matt Ryan garbage time routine and then the Box the Winston think he might be out of the week in 5 weeks no division would be my tick it does feel like one of the rare weak ones where most of the divisions already seem clear Elysium from the Mars 20 pics by week where they were all them in the right side of history of Lamar Kyle diebel I just want to talk about this game picks the line is stated to half all week I thought for sure I was going to be three okay I thought it was moved to 3 and never moved its two and a half which means Vegas stinks the Saints are better than the Rams because you get three points at home right now the Saints indoors Outdoors has always been a thing I if you told me the line was to be a half-point off at 3 I would have guessed Rams 3 and 1/2 not Saints not. Rims to nap and I don't really understand this I actually feel like people might be still sleep in there on the ramps but we'll get to them when we do the pics it's I think people just assume they're just not last year's team anymore and I actually disagree so I don't want to blast stream the Saints fans here but where they like super fired up for Drew Brees on that Monday night game ultimate that game that's the last point it's probably worth making the way the vacuum and did regardless of everything that led up to it the Texans game willing or juvenalian kind of Victory than you head into this game that you're talkin off as this Revenge game if they can win this game they starting I like to know what these two kind of narrative building surge games Breeze you start ask how how much longer can you play is this it are we going to be able to send them off with a championship and then yes or no to be like a really special season for the Saints especially I agree with you about not looking in the past that he's part of sports that chip on your shoulder from the one that you fell for the Boston Red Sox Boone crazy little I won Last Chance by and I will get to G there's a world in which we come out of this season and we're like that's the best offense apart in the week seems like they've just turned him up and which was the was the big talk during Fantasy in July and August it's like anger is gone are they going to turn it up a notch as I can be able to save this memory but I feel like I feel like they were in 3rd or 4th gear Within These first two years trying to make sure he didn't have too much of a wear-and-tear this year it seems like there is out there. As strong as a boulder but if a boulder had the most expensive running shoes and also the fastest 40 time McCaffrey was a better fantasy pick heading into the season just strictly because of how high has Flores because the volume because of the carries and receptions that you know he's going to get and Kimora is more big play dependents when you wash Kamara for literally want to play you have that why would I ever want to watch anybody else instead of response answers players saquon I have them 1A 1B as you know I think saquon is the best football player of all time but I think tomorrow is just a better offense cuz he broke a 59-yard her that Cowboys game and it's like all right that's not happening and they just take them out tomorrow as pretty hard to take out that office your conspiracy guy selling his PD test so we didn't have to play for the Giants team think like he actually just took piggy went to the store but it is all right number one I'm supposed to chicken is the Mist make sure the second and socks there's no Gardner Minshew the first is name is just the second what's the fucken icon Stage II but there's no first oh my God it's just it's amazing it's a very rich family tax now I will say he came into that game last week we talked about the podcast on Sunday and we're like who's that we looked it up it says G Minshew in the bank so we start calling that other online and then he's just completed passes and the passes that weren't complete were dropped off Reiki never through bad patches cheap adult hit her when it came in a cold so do you want to say register caveat Nick Foles injury is legitimately sad that's a bummer it's it's impossible not to celebrate and fall in love with the Gardner Minshew story but it can be expensive Mixels we lost in the first quarter every one of them off season it took a while for me I don't feel you or anyone else I got permission to go to my schedule so bad cuz it was kind of like finally next to the sizes team and he loses in a quarter it's over time to shine from the Jaguar fan perspective it's just not like Bortles which is the only thing that matters to anyone right there just wanted somebody cool again that have G Minshew video show who is the Mississippi mustache 23 years old 6th round draft pick out of Washington state part of the bike Beach air raid tree he is he is a fascinating person and player had a really interesting career to this point very quickly friend when he's not aware he started at Northwest Mississippi Community College okay then he was not at our last chance U then you'll see is Carolina okay then graduate transfer the muses last year of Eligibility somewhere where is it going to be guess where he almost went to jail and he was going to play but he wanted to be he was based at the mall or he said many many people friend about this many people are saying that I want to learn from Nick Saban one of The Incredibles Nick Saban NFL this is just a bit of all your indefensible bits this is the worst one back to the NFL Nick Saban what are you afraid of why you scared what it is he's not scared of anything he's going to be the pictures of any coach in college football history Great Bear Bryant he's literally the Pinnacle of achievement in his profession is the best of all time is the best coach of anyone that just exploit student athletes does it pay the great egrets a pristine lyrics so he went to a nice nice little semi hot kitchen sprayer was like a joke on the Redskins and then came but went back to college and was fine again because college football it's like won't have to work 40 hours a week in college football everyone thought your Kelly was going to be the Steve Spurrier that's not happening out at Nick Saban going to have that mixture small makes me mad when you do this I want to change LSU okay here before the Dolphins tenure it wasn't for him when he when he talks about his Brownstone was a Friend of the Devil what's the frame cuz he needed to go easier it is not easy to consistently win in Alabama that is one of the great misconceptions in the world when he took over Alabama to shoot right when he's done there is literally historic great yeah that's great so he's going to go to Alabama and then gets call from Mike Leach do you want to leave the nation in passing this is the leech pitch what was the Washington State exactly what happened at all kinds of passing marks and he ends up as a middling Prospect I don't think anybody thought that he was going to be a pro certainly this year except one of the interesting narrative that had developed around him was that he's basically Baker Mayfield why does Jester build you know they're the exact same height and size some of that comes from the Swagger which obviously like they both have these really problem probable personas some of it is the style of play you know we and stink fucking guy because this was exhausting for a really long time as a college football fan we have moved out of the era of doubting whether these quarterbacks you play and spread offenses home from are ATMs can play in the NFL NFL teams want now you have the strongest arm know but guess what he does have because he played in an Air Raid Offense and has been trained to Taylor his game to this kind of execution incredibly accurate thrower quick passes and quick reads Hebrews through his progressions so you like that right now I'm at love to Sean I think sex okay so yes but I don't know if that no yes but because he's thrown into that team that he's basically playing Five offensive line positions at once. Incredible incredible so this is been a big year for you with with menu fat a crush on but I do feel like if Tyler from The Bachelor hadn't come in your life a few months ago you'd be more excited

athletic fees from from his Washington State season 16 stories about this guy like walking around with bottles of Crown Royal in the waistband of his jeans on campus has an icon he's a refrigerator in the NFL who knows but it's it's so fun and it's exactly the salad you need after losing something like Nick Foles and it's really one of the only things that can make the Jaguars interesting to anyone but Jacksonville fans I mean the first game for the was such a debacle other than with Myles Jack ejection was so weird pologize it's like sitting in the field like you was like toxicated you know you had other stuff though because you play the Chiefs Week 1 and there's just guys are open all over the place play for nine angles and it's like that's not the most I don't know if the Jags are good that was not where you want to go in week one we have to go cuz this was we said 25 minutes is 45 pack Bud succession bring it house and before we do that I'm teaming up with FanDuel to give you a

houses here when to do million-dollar pics in a second want to talk about Team USA which not only lost a France and got knocked out of the metal round 2 days ago yes early this morning before I even woke up they also lost to Serbia and now it's looking like 7th place Team USA unbelievable disappointed after the realization that and this occurred I don't know 6 weeks ago two months ago we weren't going to have a single headline NBA star participate in in on Team USA behalf mean it is the case that Donovan Mitchell was our best talent and Jayson Tatum was a close second and neither one of them could get hurt and then Jayson Tatum got hurt and then we lost and that's it like if this is one of your guys charts or Zach kram wrote this this is the least talented Team USA play in modern basketball history so my expectations were not high so we were looking at this trying to figure out we weren't too optimistic about Team USA they were I think - 700 favorites on point of drop that maybe - 300 by the time the tournament started and I was going to throw the rosters trying to figure out who could beat them and other than Serbia really didn't feel good about any of these teams and then you actually start watching the tournament and it's like I'll Barbosa Varejao Brazil there they are Australia Ingles and Patty Mills near Baines is God's been playing together forever France Fournier gobert and it was the chemistry in the comradery made such a difference compared to the team you know that we put together we just basically throwing together a team of either all stars or maybe possibly down the road all stars in role players that was one thing the other thing is just not having alpha dog I was talking to a friend of mine about if she has James Harden been on this team just take it just kept everybody else just had James Harden in there instead of Kemba Walker we probably roll for everybody it's just hard to win the win any of these tournaments we know that one guy even when we had the rent in 2010 or 11 and it was young Duran in Turkey he was told the guy that took a song you know that that was what I just don't think Donovan Mitchell on the international stage is ready to be that guy yet so those are my two takeaways that's not that big a deal he's he's super young Donovan Mitchell I mean this was terrific grooming he got to be the alpha dog I mean I really like you at all now based on watching hit him and gaubert both in that tournament I mean it I'm going to take another look at their over under right now I'm feeling pretty pretty strong about the under plus bulb went out and and and shut the lights out today or this is Bobby does Bogdan was the other one yeah but I still feel like international basketball matters I still think it was really good for MIT Mitchell at 29 and was excellent for the first three quarters of the front of the France game and then the last quarter everything falls apart they only scored 13 points in the in the fourth inning is a combo of I didn't love the way the team was coached I don't love the concept of trying to play everybody and they if you watch these other teams it's like just pick your best sex guys and play them I don't think that help them and I think that Tatum going down really hurt because he allowed them to Place Mall about 5 with him at the center because really you know if you do that against France now now go bear has to try to figure out who he's he's defending all that stuff but I still wonder if you just put that one proven dude and it would have to be one of the best eight guys in the league better American right and you put that dude in those games like they did France have scored them 26-213 the fourth quarter this is not happening if you have hard in her you know Anthony Davis selfish to want stuff but I would like to know anybody just just an A+ listeria and I think this is the rub with Kemba right he's a really good player he's an All-Star but he's a level below the top-level he's even a level Talent lies below Kyrie now he brings so much other stuff to say but I'd rather have him for an entire season than Kyrie but Kyrie is somebody that I'm glad you reached that conclusion since he's on your team this year yeah but I'm saying Kyrie if he was properly invested on a team like this I don't know if you score 13 points in the 4th quarter you know so that would have been you know he had an opportunity if it doesn't matter if we can go down a very quick Kyrie whole here would not have been a cool way for him to re-establish himself on kind of the National Basketball level cuz right now is he feels a little villainy yeah I don't think he cares how it played out for Team USA is one of the reasons why none of these guys want to do it the two big factors to me I don't buy the whole get ready for the season bulshit cuz these guys are playing basketball anyway I don't think they wanted to spend two weeks in I just don't I think it's as far away from the United States as you can go basically and I don't think they wanted to do it I think the time zone thing and just being away from your comfort zone and being in a weird country with different rules and all that stuff they just like they're like fuck that not to mention all the stuff even before the tournament and then you know the downside of losing this turned out to be bad for the guys on this team this was not a positive that they were on the team that finished in seventh place just like it wasn't a positive when for Stephon Marbury and all those dudes in 04 when they fucking lost that they don't they don't want to look bad I think it matters to them and the people around them I do I don't think they want to look bad I think they probably looked at have this played out and they look at it like man I dodged a bullet on that one that would have sucked you know I guess I think we're going to move on and you know the upcoming NBA season where seven teams have a legit chance to win we will offer get until the Olympics come around that this happened but here's the problem what do we do now with the Olympics and what do we do with all this stuff and do we just need to rethink it completely and I and I think I think you mean I think we should have rethought adapter 2016 I would I would do the soccer system and do under 23 and that's it and I would I wouldn't use I wouldn't rely on Veterans I wouldn't trust them I would try to build you know I would try to use it as a combo of putting young people in a position to succeed having having like a real system in place where you're developing players for a couple years they graduate the next guys come in and it's just got understood when you come in the league in for somebody like Trae young like yeah this is part of where your new or Devin Booker whoever you didn't even being this team 4 to 3 years and then you graduate and then the next group comes in I would love to see them do that over eat whatever the fuck happened with the rest of the put together this time bummer I don't really care but the the point you're making about instantiating some kind of order with the expectations are set and the commitment is is there we're not going through this fist attrition game over the course of the summer of you every four days another two guys declare themselves out like that that's silly in that reflects a lack of planning a lack of care in terms of of you know properly understanding that what these guys are willing to do and you know what what the competing time considerations they have in front of them what they're going to choose cuz like it it it felt self-evident as every other every single guy from the All-Star team and in all NBA teams route route route route route was like okay what was Plan B going to be yeah well we need a plan B cuz we care she would not care but we're kind of a no-man's-land now so I thought I would rather go younger than rely on some of these older dudes I was Trae young and played Darren Fox Bagley just a whole team of those dudes even more fun Fox was on the team and then he wasn't that's the big mystery for me from this whole thing is I think I think he ditched the T map because they were given more minutes to Derek weight is my my theory my conspiracy theory he did he left the team a day after playing 6 minutes in an exhibition game well what's up I mean this is just go all goes into the planning was a big winner was was Frankie smokes the whole thing Z first grade basketball team he played great defense he added, for court and you actually do care about EX I would see million-dollar pics but first I think we need to talk about Eminem's hazelnut the best part of kick back to watch the game is enjoying a spread of your favorite

chocolate candies in the cookies cuz she loves Hazel that so look go hazelnutty try the new M&M hazelnut spread chocolate candies today and you could celebrate him pour themselves on you after you went all these million-dollar Picsart here we go last week we almost swept million-dollar pics all we needed was Joe Flacco not to turn into Joe Flacco on Monday night against a seemingly terrible Raiders team playing three points we hit on the Rams - 2 and we had on the Colts bus 6.5 for 500,000 hit on the paths - 5 and 1/2 for 400k you talk me into that one in the last piece was two separate Broncos bets when was a parlay that they would have won the other was Broncos - 3 the good news I am up 180000 after week one that's a lot of money house so we do know that our pics with the juice 180 even with the juice hundred eighty cuz the other one was a part of that so I'm going to throw some games I'm looking at at you and you can tell me wanted to actually why don't we start there why don't you tell me one or two that you're looking at that you think I should be thinking about 4 million naira pics so I think we need to start with kind of a big picture thing here last week week one we started with the idea we wanted to pay attention to the home dogs and they're good Folks at Action Network picked up on you and the Cousin Sal talking about how much you like home dogs early in the season and as a matter of fact they went and and showed us some stats we got a 56% hit rate 31 games by 500 since 2003 on home dogs through weeks 1 through 4 so we only had five of those home dogs and Week 1 and the home dogs went 2 and 3 the only ones to come through for the Oakland Raiders and the Arizona Cardinals in Arizona Cardinals took something fairly extraordinary Adam a practicing Matt Patricia and the Detroit Lion you know coach The Crew 2 permit I mean it if if that dummy offensive coordinator doesn't inadvertently call timeout that on the successful third-down play by Detroit Detroit when's that game by 8.7 and that's it but none of that the home dogs when two and three this week Bill Simmons and this is over reaction week it's a famous week on NFL calendar week 2 of the NFL season overreaction week we have eight home dogs half the Slate is home dogs cuz Vegas loves the squares taking a look at this entire slate and and you know it's setting figures for people to just take what what that the taste they have in their mouth and try and pound teams like the Dallas Cowboys pound teams like the LA Chargers pound teams like the Philadelphia Eagles will let's go throughout the home dogs so we got Dolphins plus 19 against the Pats Lions + 2 and 1/2 against the Chargers Redskins + 6 against the Cowboys Raiders + 7 against the chiefs-broncos + 2 1/2 against the Bears Giants + 2 against the bills Falcons plus one against the Eagles everybody out on that Falcons team and then the Jets that move to + 7 because of the darnold thing against the Browns on Monday night so yeah half the Slate home dogs so there is another angle to this that I want a sharp it up and share with you just for your consideration if you take the guys that were coming off of a home when it's a it's a smaller set here so we're looking for Road favorites in week week 2 who were at home last week and they won their game is only three roads favorites that fit that category it's the Chargers the Cowboys and the Eagles since in in the last 10 years and we're only talking about this in the first month of the season so this is a September 1st at because this is when the opportunity arises Road favorites coming in off of Home win are 14 and 40 against the spread and 40 that is that's taking 56% and I'm pushing it up into a percentage that feels a lot more like a winner yeah I like it so here's what I'm looking at just going to list the games that actually do like and we're taking this before the Panthers Bucs game tonight Colts Titans Colts are getting three against the Titans nephew Kyle and I watch that tightens Browns game very carefully it was a very strange game it looks like the Browns were in control Marietta was bad and then hold the game shifted on this long drive or the Browns kept getting penalties the left tackle the Browns got kicked out the backup got hurt the Titan starting to get a little momentum Ellison Bakery was running for his life he looks like he got hurt and then in the second half the game got away from them she wants first 15-20 minutes of that game I actually was not impressed by the Titans you are neither Rekha never yeah where is the Colts I felt like that quotes Chargers game is a playoff game last week and I thought both of them have a chance to be the third or fourth best team in the AFC the one thing that sucks for the Colts is funchess got hurt but they have a whole bunch of young receivers I picked up Deon Cain to my I am I auction lyrics actually cuz I think he's going to be there number two guy I thought he had a couple good moments in last week's game but it's just a classic I think the Colts can win the game but even if they don't I think it's a field goal game and a I just don't believe in Mariota I don't think he's good I think once they had the lead they can play differently but he's one of those guys if he doesn't have believe you're in trouble and I think the Colts can come out Marlon Mack was awesome last week and I think people are starting to realize how good he is incredible offensive line for the Colts Titans I don't think we'll be able to pressure him the same way they pressured Baker and his third string left tackle and I and I just like the spot for them I think they're better and it and here's the best thing it's a must-win for the Colts cuz I went to is a disaster so I'm looking at that what you think of that came out I am strongly behind you on that I thought the two there was three games I enjoyed last week the two best games that featured 100% playoff contenders felt like to me Saints Houston Colts Chargers and then I thought Carolina was pretty good against the Rams and the Rams and Carolina was another one that I felt like it was pretty well played game you know competitive in terms of the quality of execution the game plan I like very much this Colts play that you're you're you're putting in place here I feel like if I don't mind giving the Titans a slight Edge you know one one and a half but anything beyond that starts to feel they're very generous I think the Colts really did a great job on both lines both sides of the ball the thing that the Colts can do in terms of establishing the run and protecting Jacoby because of how great their their offense wine is what what's going to change with the Titans hold this Outhouse Colts are also + 155 to win the game out right can you mention the Rams so Everybody's Talkin by this is a Revenge game for the Saints the Rams the Panthers kind of hung around in that game and it ended up being a 3-point game for the Rams I didn't think the Panthers were as good as you thought they were but to me it was more the Rams had multiple chances to just put that game away and specifically where look like they're just going for the game-clinching touchdown they end up settling for a field goal Greg like Mrs at now the Panthers come back and that think that game was closer than I think the game look closer than actually was so that look at this spot this week I still believe in the rain I think the Rams are one of the three or four best teams in the league their home Saints are playing you know not in the dome I didn't love the way the Saints lost last week I thought that drive that last drive to the Texans was embarrassing I like the three running backs for the Rams I like Brianna like Henderson girly I thought looked pretty good last week for somebody who we keep hearing about his arthritis Cooper kupp huge and the most important thing to me this is a proven game for golf because you had got sucked in the Super Bowl and really wasn't that good last week considering there a lot of guys open and he just got this huge contract and I think they're going to really want to bang home that he's good in this game and I just like the spot for that maybe you can throw on I think you can throw on the Saints even the Texans last week they could barely protect glasses get the shit kicked out of them but he was able to move around and make plays and guys were open that hole game I believe in the ramps I think this lines too low so that would be my second team what do you think I like it very much there is also a couple of sort of modern modern vintage Trends the Rams have been legitimately great at home over the last couple years this version of the Rams in in Los Angeles and the Saints have for whatever reason this like last handful of years a really bad record in September both straight up and against the spread so what those two things as the overly I also feel like there's some value here in the sense that you win the bet if the Rams win by a field goal so I X Out The Revenge factor I also agree with the idea that the Rams Outdoors especially with that they have a genuine home-field advantage in the sense of how they play I don't know how the fans are I don't know if it's a big are not get everything they play well they play well at home I like that Twix that is one of the one of the Peace that game it's they're playing at 1:25 Pacific and it's somebody who has watched his daughter play in a lot of soccer games around that time it's fucking brutal from like 11 to 3 when you especially in September when the weather kind of ratchets up for a couple weeks it's going to be like 90 on Sunday and I think it's going to be I think that's going to affect the Saints more than the Rams for a couple reasons won Saints played most of their games indoors the outdoor thing the Rose Bowls just hot there's no shade anywhere it's just that you just baking on the field it's like a it's like a frying pan and I also think the Rams are in better position with their receivers the one thing that jumped out at me in the Saints Texans game is the other receivers who are Michael Thomas and Kamara where you know it's a it's a it's like a lot of those taking type guys I don't totally stressed like if they have to go for or like Michael Thomas gets cramps I don't really trust 40 Road Breeze either so I think I think that's a factors well alright so will Walmart those down here's the third one this one's going to surprise you and I watched a lot of that Seahawks Bengals game last week okay and I had the Seahawks in a parlay which I eventually lost and was getting very frustrated by that game because you know watching your like I the Seahawks are playing well this sucks so frustrating god wow man I can't believe I bet on them and the reality is the Bengals played well in that game and actually went I did I did a lot of research for this game specifically and I read all the Bengals stuff on different websites I think this Zach Taylor might be good I think we might have missed the boat on an M as like a little bit being a little bit slippery because it have AJ Green in that game and didn't matter they threw the ball I think 56 times he probably could have won in Seattle end up getting a huge play to lock it at the end and then you know the even to The Bitter End the Bengals were in there and fighting and I think they looked at that game is like that's actually was like a good loss for us we're playing Seattle Seattle actually might be good in Cincinnati made it seem like they weren't that good so I mention that because the Bengals are only favored by two against the 49ers this week the 49ers play the Bucks last week the Bucks have just in the baseball outfits of lead I really regret thinking that they could be the NFC South sleeper I hate that division but but they are not going to be the sleeper Jameis they're not the answer but I was I was kind of shocked by how bad the Niners where to and kayak I loves Jimmy G Pick 6 they had dumb penalties and it was like Tampa's just dying to give them the game and they're not taking it I don't need the Niners are good either so I look at this since he game since he's home I think there's a little bit of energy post Marvin Lewis with them and I and I just think the lines too low I think those teams are either even or maybe the Bengals or even a little bit better in the line is only Bengals by 2 and if you read all the all the all the stuff going on in Cincinnati people actually did kind of like this team and I think this team thinks it might be pretty pretty good maybe not 11 and 5 but it seemed that's kind of battle every week so Bengals -2 I like that one what do you think I met him there with you I can't believe where it's kind of 343 it's a horse late because of all the hound dogs but you know I like what I saw out of Cincinnati as well that Andy Dalton passing performance was like the diametric opposite of of Joe Flacco compared to sort of older guys like you know what do they have left in the tank FICO had the had nothing left in the tank he had Kendall Roy's poopy bed sheets in this house on the rock is all-time most yards as a professional last week against together was pretty impressive and they're basically run in the same Rams offense so that guy John Ross and it's his third season is effectively in like the Brandin Cooks or Robert Woods kind of frisky speed guy spot and he was really good and I don't know why I thought that was a good game for them and it was as weird as it sounds a good loss so a marking them down so that made me think with the Seahawks normally I would say I'll Steelers to Classic they look terrible when we come back home take care of business what is the Seahawks are better than we think they are because the Bangles made it seem like they weren't that good but actually they are good and it was just the Bengals are just better than we thought because this always happens a week to week 3 we overreact partly because we think the result happened because a team was either worse than we thought or better than we thought and in this case the Seahawks that are for against the Steelers I'm just asking did the what are the Steelers show you last week that they're good play after that they are a potential playoff team I know that I know it's a shit sandwich for them but did you come away from that game thinking anything positive about anything with them no but the problem is I think we have to be careful with that because did that way they were so thoroughly out prepared out coach they they said they don't have an answer for is Antonio Brown like they could have really used a Antonio Brown this week ya guys not making plays at skill positions where they we've grown so accustomed to Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown bailing out the Steelers in crucial moment they couldn't they couldn't get a third they couldn't Advance on on third-down I don't know what the number ended up being but how many third Downs did they turn in the first very very very small number this is my point though they don't have those guys anymore Moncrief is the most vilified Steeler football week favors just terrible in that game and I think he actually might be hurt this week and everybody was hoping James Washington would emerge as like this guy but who knows she might not and then Schuster who I think was overqualified number to it remains to be seen if he can be the Michael Thomas Hopkins type of guy in this team they just don't have the same threats and you know I tell probably regroup and try to pound the ball with Connor Connor did nothing last week but I know that's out of the bottle. Just don't think there is explosive and then on the defensive side of the ball they got torched I mean brain didn't even really play while the first 20 minutes of the game he was missing guys that were open they had guys open that whole game and the only guy who didn't play well in the whole team is Sony Michelle other than that they did whatever they want so I'm probably staying away I just wanted to mention that if you think the Bengals are better than then we thought then that would also mean the Seahawks are better than we thought and maybe there's a way to Parlay those two together and just be like this is the one result from last week we're betting on for week 2 that these teams are better than people think last one okay last one you're going to laugh I think the Jags Texans line is like three points too high Jackson getting denied the getting nine points in Houston they got embarrassed last week against the Chiefs now their quarterback broke his clavicle clavicle in the first half that was depressing the game was hot it was a hockey game in the Chiefs do the running all around the field I didn't think that game where I asked for that came out I didn't learn anything from that game except G meant you who we could just talk about Mallory was lights out he never throw we didn't understand what was going on we didn't know where he came from but compare that to what we saw in in the Texans game we're watching just got the crap kicked out of them I don't think they really had the same pass rush that they used to have that's for sure and I don't trust the coach that much either and it just kind of has all the makings people are just like all we have are they throw the Texans into a until parlay Ortiz or whatever and how to be great I'll go get back on the horse and the Jaguars are done it's like I just think there's value here I think the line should be like 6 or 6 and 1/2 in the line is 9 for some reason what do you think I like it I like I agree with the idea that anything over a touchdown feels like value this is an overcompensation by the public in response to the fact that you know the public love big dick Nick both the bus and and you know it feels extremely deflating it's at least a two to two-and-a-half Point Vegas swing to accommodate brother Minshew on the heels of a. I think that's the entirety of it but I agree I don't think these two teams like on sort of a you did a power ranking basis I don't think they're very far apart in terms of you know if they're there. I think they're both kind of like in that 1312 to sort of 16 range that are jaguars in Houston at this stage of the season and I think everything over a touchdown starts to feel like a little bit of value in a little bit of you know just a regular Vegas compass mission for the starting quarterback going out if you parlayed the Jaguars to beat the Texans and the Colts to be the Titans what do you think the odds would be for that it's either they're going to be great just like 5 to 161 what if I told you it's almost 11 to 1 I didn't look at the money line for the nine points right as plus 360 for the Jags yeah of course of course of course + 360 for the Jags + 155 for the Colts + 1073 three hundred bucks on that website you put $100,000 on that and you win 1 million $73,000 I'm not going to talk you out of it what do I say is I like a tease better I just like that you know that he's feels like the right way to put those those two lined up what about a little 50k flyer sure 50k flyer I love it that's still get you $550,000 yeah that's pretty good it's pretty good so so we're holding in on Rams - 2 1/2 over the Saints Bengals minus 2 over the 49ers Colts bus 3 over the Titans and then maybe a little bit less on Jags Bus 9 on the Texans with the parley as well how's that sound to you I like that that's a good menu we have a little money to play with you we won last week right so maybe I have a I feel strongly about like the three just straight-up play in the number I I really like the Rams I really like the Bangles what's the other one I like that the Jags getting the nine right so maybe maybe we go 300 on the Bengals 300,000 in the Bengals 300000 on the Rams 200 on the Colts 100 r150 on the Jags + 9 and then 50k on the Jags Colts parlay how's that sound the only the only recommendation I would have his to put the 150 on the Colts but let's go ahead I like the Colts I think they're better okay so here's where we're settling here the million-dollar picks for week 2 Rams - 2 1/2 over the Saints 300K Bengals -2 / the 49ers 300K Colts football Colts plus 3 over the Titans 250k how about it we're up at 8:50 already I know Jaguars + 9 over the Texans 100k and then Jags Colts to win the parlay moneyline parlay + 50 k to win plus 1073 Slappy 50k to win about $535,000 something like that that sound good to you for me to like a lot of that so that's a lot of money that's a nice many wasted we did it this was a hard slate with all kinds of stay away is no reactions I think we would come up with a nice little men you hear well done I really enjoyed it all right we're to take a break and then we're going to bring Mallory Rubin in to talk about succession all right we're going to talk succession but first let's talk about Roman not Roman from succession but Roman let's face it guys are terrible at taking care of their health study shows 70% of guys who experience erectile dysfunction don't get treated for it.

love succession if you haven't caught up on the season or watch it feel free to turn up the rest of the podcast there will be spoilers I think this is a group fantasy fantasy said this is the best best show since badman best new show when the game is the best best new show in that Mad Men Breaking Bad character kind of way and we all love it I think for the same reasons it for different reasons house what's your favorite thing about the chef honestly it's the sharpness of it I find myself and this could be attributable to my old age watching segments stopping them I'm watching everything after their Sunday night so I'm not sitting down and watching it as appointment television it's personal appointment television for me cuz I'm watching it alone and I'm watching it alone because I want to be able to stop after certain scenes and re-watch what I think I just heard I'm also giving audible reactions to things as they occur in fact I had an audible reaction both times that I watch the shiv at the dinner table scene all right so my favorite thing is I have like six characters that I love on the show usually you have a show in Mad Men characters I love Rodger I love Don Draper like Peggy there a couple Side characters every Christina Hendricks scene was great out of state but it's like I don't even know who my favorite character is and you have a you have a guy like Alan Ruck prominently featured two episodes ago and crushes it with the most funeral and then in this last episode from on Sunday night is barely in it but when he's in it he still has his PR is still outstanding they just have a way of not relying on characters but still keeping them completely fresh and perfect and I think that's what I like most Mallory what do you like the sense of who the characters are it is a pretty remarkable achievement to craft show real live deeply deeply unlikable people and still have to create an experience where he was rooting for them they're actually invested in them and it is also this incredible Balancing Act of tone and emotion it is hysterical is definitely I would throw in Atlanta and flea bag and a couple other shows obviously this is a pro billions podcast and Company is other shows that have him very meaningful in recent years but succession that was more talking about like the you can watch every show three times and analyze every single thing that happens in a temperature really want to return to it and study the text but it's also just so purely pleasurable to watch it's so fun and it's all so so deeply tragic and there is actually something Shakespearean about it was kind of funny and it when you're reading soft heading into a season 1 of a show and all the actors with while you notes it's the modern day King Lear it's alright come on yeah it's incredible you know the other thing that I was thinking about we could take the succession music and put it behind anyting and it would sound 15 times more profound and intense and whatever have sez next it'll sound so much more potent I don't get tired of it I haven't gotten tired of it all and she's perfect for the actual show yeah I love the beat the beat kiss me so I suggest things by halves and I who have known each other forever and I've been texting really for the last what 20 years right house when did we start texting when we have sex whenever whenever texting to say I got a cell phone that permitted it and if a show has enough quirks where were texting each other and it's something like house texting about Kendall's poop bed this show every week has something like Kendall's poop bad where we can then make jokes bad for next four and you know the Jets are now lying in Kendall stupid as a water fountain of of jokes like that house it's it's more than a water fountain it's a fire hydrant I mean you could just take if you if you transcribed all of cured macaw key mccaughan all of Roman Roy's dialogue from the beginning to the end yet so it's like a it's a half-hour comedy read it spectacular this is the sharpness that I'm talking about the the moment for the candle literally shutting the baddest the family was we should hang the bed was obviously a perfect television moment but for me that moment is Moline from this episode that I was texting to everybody the morgue is closed is just an Alzheimer well then so when the shit in the bed meant to be dead I'm rewinding and slow mo in to see if it's Kendall shit or if it was the sex partner was it was unclear was her side of the bed but then it was clear that it was actually Kendall cheats on his on his but I was hoping when I first saw him in countering a substance that it was like a bloody nose thing like the very first reaction I had was please let that be a bloody nose Okay so there's less I just be a different bodily fluids because I watch this with my husband he also had a brief moment ambiguous Kendall wakes up by the way do you know that I just assumed maybe they were hooking up and then I don't think so I don't know I mean I guess you could see the evening and folding numerous different ways but I think there's a moment of shared understand it was achieved in the helicopter in that was the Breakthrough that they needed to attempt to broker the deal the next morning candles alone in bed he wakes up he sniffs the air what's round holes under the cover lifts his ass cheek and under his ass cheek is amount of human ship and it wasn't subtle as she should have put that in the credits at the beginning where they put like brief nudity and violence thing like a parenthetical next to the brief nudity parenthetical brief nudity open paren shit I wasn't slightly excited because one of the interesting attributes of this terrific drama it doesn't really show very much sex in the fact that uses sex in such a highly humiliating way yeah obviously Roman being the best example of it but across-the-board that there really isn't any sexy time I even shiv who I am who you and I have kind of shared we we we you know she's attractive we like the character we didn't type of sex she's having a is not sex that's it that's thrilling it in any way shape or form yeah it's it's almost like she's scheduling business lunches. Akron about their relationship is this brief moments where you do feel like you're finally cleansing something genuine about them or bad connection of either have with each other or really desperately seek with each other is like to make stuff look real Roman Jerry sing right now so superb in stitches hitting every single no because you are able to say well this is a manifestation of how vile Roman Shields how undervalued an unloved she feels in his own family he feels worthless and so he wants someone else to make him because he's a necrophiliac holy shit is this happening is he really jerking off at Jerry's bedroom bathroom en-suite bathroom actually hold on ensuite bathroom maybe it made me think I wanted to get back to the ship thing for a second because we goes to use her electric toothbrushes and vibrator and the ensuite bathroom in her room with Roman and we know that woman masturbates in the ensuite bathroom in Jerry's room so we can assume that every bedroom in this beautiful estate has its own bathroom so Kendall presumably has a private bathroom door off to the right tsheets by the way not paying nearly enough tension to wear his hands are what his hands touching to the bathroom to clean up himself and then returned to the bed is he going to take the jelly woke up to rinse them off is he throwing the sheets as he's hiding the evidence what you doing with that because there's a moment later when they the whole family is walking and they pass one of the one of the people who works on the estate and she's carrying like a batch of freshly laundered when is she looks at him like she knows that because she found a bed without lemons and is like what happened here or did he actually leave his shit sheets he bought them up and you put them in the garbage bathroom garbage what is the status on the helicopter that point today is about to leave now he doesn't care I agree with Bill I think what he did was he bought them up we watch the ball and he found a wastebasket and put them in that wastebasket on so I wasn't even destroying it has to go like if that's where that's where I should sheets go they go in the garbage they don't go anywhere else has dogs and you don't have any other options also last thing here through the sheets to the mattress we hear Tom elsewhere the episode assassinate the character of the sheets he says love thread count these are not high-quality sheets the person most likely nephew Kyle you're saying you're staying at my house and you get super super Bond and you wake up and you're covered in your own feces and you don't want us to find out what you do matters flippable what is a 1 out of a mattress right, I'm going to notice it called protections and she's in the garbage outside your house they're not going to look at stake and Kendall Kendall believe that he's a kind of royalty and some kind of royalty way which is just that there should be sheets and they go away I think it's possible I'm going to I'm going to offer this observation that the shit did not see through to the matinee because of the character of the dinner that dinner was a beautiful glorious look like an 8 rib prime rib roast if you take on that level of protein and don't have a lot of roughage accompanying it I mean there was spinach at the table and Tom called everybody's attention if all Ken had was half a slab of beef pretty solid bowel movement chunky monkey red like it's not a full binding diet he also guzzle a bottle of vodka did numerous lines of cocaine that's what helped to come out yeah just say what was in there the stuff that was in there some people that are backed up due to just have a lot of coffee other people just did not say cocaine Mallory once described the show as the reason she loved it is because it's about shame and guilt which I thought was a really good way to put it it's and what's funny is first of all the ringer has always been in on the show since day one and the Raiders. Shame and guilt but you know what sets up the first season that you had this old guy the old patriarch whose breaking down and everybody's racing to kind of take over and I just assumed watching it as the show got better and better and had to clear episode 4 was in everybody kind of put the jigsaw puzzle together and had a real like oh oh wait a second this is actually has a chance to be an all-time show I thought he was going to die at the end of the air being a hospital whatever one of the Revelations 2 season 2 is he's actually like has his fastball back and that's why this last episode was so great he's manipulated shave he manipulates the other family and then has The Incredibles scene with the president from 24 who runs the Rival sandwich and he's like and she's like what I should think about your offer and he says you don't have an offer this is my offer amazing this is what the offer is and he's just sizing her up he change his personality instead of being like the boisterous fuck off all that stuff we see like this different side of how he negotiates when he's calculating the whole room he sees shiv having a heart attack as the ladies like me lunch shift to run the company and he's like that would be my decision I'm not going to commit to that so now she's been literally ship and then just the way he handled the whole thing in the end him walking up the stairs I thought that was one of the best episodes not just of the show but of the decade Benicia it was fabulous I think about that is he just like all of the other characters even everything you just said is true but he is not immune from the same from the the pitfalls that all of them fall in time at the dinner table she just wants Marcia to stop drinking and to stop airing is clear displeasure that she has with how he's conducting himself he can't shaved not say what's on her mind tells Kendall hey don't party this weekend Roman is at the other end of the table bill have you read Thomas Lipton Electric Circus what do you think of it he can't think of a real book like these are the people mortifying him around him and he's actually not in control of the people who his entire life and identity is built around thinking he can't control fully but that's ironically his fly everyone in the show has some fatal fly his far as that his kids suck and it was like he could have all the money in the world but if all of your kids suck and you can't figure out which person to turn your company over because you don't trust any of them that your fly it's not that they suck it's it's one of my truck to hit one of my favorite moments from season 1 when they're all eye colors Connor's Ranch in Kendall says he has a great decorate fight with Morgan and he says to him you're so fucking jealous of your own children because you gave us all these things that you never had and that is one of the defining things in his life is that he is a self-made man his kids are all spoiled entitled assholes made them that way it's going to be me and Ben Simmons but I thought the thing that made this episode 9 in that camp of calling this episode the very best episode of the entire series does far I've seen the internet kind of debating that a little bit but I'll go ahead into that hyperbolic Camp the reason I think it's the very best is because this was the most complete version of Logan we've seen in in the entire show he had to be a different Logan Roy and I thought it was so I was sitting as it developed at the very beginning of the show that this was going to be them having to go to The Pierces enclave and pichai I was so genuinely intrigued by the idea seeing Logan in Pitch mode having having to see Logan vulnerable for the first time they play this negotiation that whole aspect of it just blew me away I couldn't have enjoyed that more plus we have should I also had the same Revelation as rum and goes to see Jerry Jerry's where the PJs and she's in her sixties and it becomes apparent something's going to happen I got kind of fire that was it take them off Jerry let's go don't like well what's wrong with you I know that's not the prisoner for Roman Roman ship Ramen and Jerry I love it this Delights me to know and I really want to see them fuck I really do know I'm sorry I'm not I'm not sorry actually and I don't care who knows it and it's just a delightful ability of the show has to to take all of the organic natural chemistry building between the actors and the characters and turn it into an actual plot line of credit do when they did an episode and it was like they're on the phone and stuff starts and it's like all of us at the same Revelation ocean is this going to happen initials had a lot of those but I thought this last episode was the best one my favorite is still the bachelor party that was when the show really and now it's just every week you're not going to have any idea where this is going to ask you a really good job of something that this is a big fantasy thing when you put a lot of characters in a place when you have like a wedding or do you know like a family Retreat or a big bachelor party where where you put 6 7 characters in a place where there's just a whole bunch of wildcard characters need to kind of don't know where it's going to go they do this over and over again I think it's smart like the collection times wedding at the end of season 1 where when Logan walks in he wasn't going to go eat at houses Point earlier really anytime Logan enters the situation you're just you're just utterly riveted like him and the description that we got was he's like a planet and that was just such a perfect encapsulation not only of what he is actual presence is the force that he has but just as this is crucially how older people perceive him and every line from every character every choice any of them make it always just as much about how the person across the room from them is is feeling about it. A person's thinking as what that actual person is doing they all have their own agendas they all have their own aims they're also all invested and working toward the same thing together so they're their allies but their enemies all at once it's going to great house and I love shiv just like Isaac character and either she's ultimately has to be the heroine of this family or they're not going to have one and I'm not 100% sure how else do you think she has the chops we have to see what she's capable of it in the rebound because it's a it's a it's a really it's feels nearly on overcomeable at the moment that mistake that she made and the violation is she committed with her dad I don't know she's being measured on the Roman Candle scale that's the thing and those to fuck up constantly I don't know where this is going the person is going to end up being in charge of Greg Gregory Gregory Gregory Ichabod Crane fuck you I would guess how many we have five episodes left my predictions knowing nothing I R E I try to read nothing I just enjoy the show my guess would be Tom and shiv that's going to start during South Roman and Jerry is not going to end well but however that ends it's not going to be a good thing. Are you it's academic and then Kendall I would assume we just keep bottoming out I mean I don't know how you do worse than waking up in a pile of your own shit to paint in the bathroom but I blame the guy I mean maybe Apple research from the Pierce family perhaps got to come out somehow I don't care sing how they can take the whole Pierce Media Company Dynamic thing and try to marry her whatever is going on in real life would be fun to be the one who uncovers what happened to Kendall finally cuz they had that kind of like really harrowing moment in the basement of that fancy Club a restaurant or wherever they were what's up how did he how did he get you back for something specific that Logan has on Kendall and he's got to come out when the show came on obviously I'm on team koppelman Levine and I was like well fuck the show this is feels like a buildings ripoff I don't feel like these show at those shows are remotely like each other but I don't I don't think they overlap the only real overlap is that Eric bogosian was on billions and then end up popping on succession to but I think not only are there a kind of complementary doing to each other but they have different ghost guess what do you think totally agree with that they're totally go so far as to say their radically different shows only in the most loose General way where money is a is a driving animus would you say that that they have something, but otherwise is the only thing where you're having an incredible Apartments incredible mansions and helicopters and planes but other than that I don't feel like there's any over that I'm just excited because I wasn't positive there was going to be another show like this that we're going to go more and more Niche or more half-hour and more experiments like fleabag and things like that and we're short miniseries or 1 1 season 2 big little lie and that's not being able to even sustain that this show could sustain four five six seasons of the show might end up being a binge mode it's conceivable if they have an awesome second season if they run this out and then they have one more awesome season and they have 30 episodes in the book with all the fucking Shakespearean chick on on here that's like a perfect pinch poke Chef it's fabulous we're going to get to the season 10 finale and we're going to we're going to the camera zoom in and a diaper to be full of shit you're going to pan out you see that is Kendall's and Iverson his son is growing up and changing his diaper caring for his ailing father I Kendall's the old Iverson is running waystar royco or you know the other thing the other card they have foursome season 2 ship getting pregnant I don't see the expected this season I thought that was going to be the way the monkey Ranch at you at why I always suspected and been suspicious of Logan telling her okay you're you're the one that obvious obviously I shouldn't use the word obvious but pulling her away from that campaign and uncomplicating the political dynamit made made a lot of sense for fending off the incursion by Stewie at Al you can't have her on the other side politics why's he needs towed to pull everybody in so okay I'll wink at shift and have her on our side and then I thought she's going to get pregnant outside of the marriage cuz that's apparently the only that she has and that was going to be the the thing that sabotaged it do we think there's a chance or self is there a possibility of time being gay at some point on the show cuz that's another card to have is a PT's date with the bachelor party episode with the relationship with Greg is complicated there's that there's something going on there that I feel like they have a car to play with no no I don't think so I mean I think there's something obviously about Tom and ships relationship that is purely transactional and it's something it's the whole relationship where they talking about 95% of it I think it's one of those things were even if that was what it started as I think you actually have some affection for each other because because the only person I can actually show that vulnerability to is it is like notable thing to me she's not afraid to let him see her in that state and he's also not afraid to let her see him beg like they're both our worst selves with each other which is weirdly like a really crucial part of marriage they might not have his like natural chemistry and a physical draw to each other but I think I found myself thinking sometimes I think at Star Santa Robb Stark what she was trying to convince him to honor his his pledge to The Fray girl you know about the nature of an arranged marriage and it's still a mess since this is ultimately when will the love builds over time instead of being the thing that you started with she said no it lasts longer like it's stronger and I kind of wonder if we all thought for a while that shouldn't ever going to fall apart and be like they're one of the store but that's part of the charm on the entire show that I have I have a bio on Shakespeare quote that I like I like just take the fucking money number one absolute favorite bow in the entire shows I think that was by a capsule everything was my favorite scene in the show I still love telling whoever to the bachelor party about spitting the sperm in his bathroom sink with hot spot it was so hot battle episode is so funny to be in system Valley didn't leave his body I thought I thought shift consoling Kendo 4th episode 2 season and Kendall just just like I thought he was the show for the first couple episodes awesome they're all incredible Incredibles yeah it's true the challenge will be for these folks and this is why I hope it goes six or eight seasons I can't think of any of them being any other character down like talkin is done he's he's rounding out yet it's a crowd of Khali the big biggest child actor about that and ask him how his brother is on a potential Hall of Fame show I do think this has a chance to be off and show I'm excited to see how it plays out the other thing that really hasn't happened yet that when you just talk about cards I would have to extend it is bringing a new characters that serve specific you know like I really like Dexter I don't think was the Hall of Fame show but was a really good show but the Lithgow season was the best show when they brought somebody in who is a fucking awesome actor in a really good part and he was just great and I think succession has that card for the next couple season with the Pierce family this can be a short-term thing we're either they buy goes through and then they fend off the bear hug because they got so big and this is the new world in the character stay around forever and that's another Power dynamic become a regular part of the chemistry and flow of what an episode of succession is or if they feel like it's not working and his presidential campaign video that you want every week you just move on and so the fact that this is ultimately a Media Company theme parks cruises are always opportunities where they're going to continue to be able to bring people in and then you would have things like who is Kendall going to try to date who else would he need who is Roman with like there's all these different ways to bring people into their lives and I don't think that just because she have left the Gill campaign we're finished with the political realm either that can always be a way to bring new players into and house there's one card that's sitting there on his presidency the hashtag me-too card Logan Roy I would imagine would have somebody to skeletons in his past that feels like it's going to be a side part though I mean it can't possibly a possibility who wrote Logan what would you mean getting canceled like if they if she got involved in this guy is like a media magnet and being involved in some sort of like how is this different than what happened to like Les moonves So This Is Us for the next episode right that the cruise line Scandal that they covered up his ass is going to be a focus of Rebecca are you familiar with the work of of the president United States of America are you familiar with the work of Donald Trump that seems like a good one to go out on thanks for thanks for doing this and if you haven't caught up on succession I don't know what's
