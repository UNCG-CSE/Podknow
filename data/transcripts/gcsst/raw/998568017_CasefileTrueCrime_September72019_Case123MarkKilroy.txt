student and he was looking forward to some downtime before taking his upcoming Medical College Admission Test Mark had made plans with three old high school friends to head to South Padre Island on the southern coastal tip of Texas a trip he had made for Spring Break twice before bordered by the Gulf of Mexico to the east and to the long shallow Laguna Madre to the west South Padre Island boasts a warm subtropical climate typical of the area after sustaining severe damage from hurricane Beulah in 1967 the islands town was rebuilt with resorts and condos cropping up along the coastline a tourism boom in the late 1980s established South Padre Island as a popular vacation destination especially for young Spring Breakers in March 1989 alone the island's population rose from 1,000 to 250,000 as students from all over the United States arrived for a week of beachside party mark Kilroy and his friend Bradley Moore had been discussing Spring Break since the beginning of the fall semester the pair attended different Texas based universities but maintained their friendship by phoning each other at least twice a week on Friday March 10 Bradley picked Marc up from his campus in Austin to begin their journey to Padre Island they dange collected bill Huddleston and Brett Martin all four were longtime friends having played basketball and baseball together in high school before disbanding after graduation they hadn't seen much of each other since and the trip afforded them a long awaited catch-up during the four-hour drive to the island they discussed their upcoming plans for the summer and reflected on how it would likely be their last time in Texas together the group checked in to the Sheraton Hotels and Resorts around mid-morning on Saturday March 11 spring break had only just begun and the hotel was still quiet but staff had removed the furniture in the lobby in preparation for the influx of students their first two days were spent at the beach behind their hotel taking advantage of the free entertainment on offer including concerts movies and parties four days into the break on Tuesday March 14 lieutenant George capito was on duty at the Brownsville sheriff's office in southern Texas when three young men arrived wanting to speak to somebody about one of their friends Bradley more Bill Huddleston and Brett Martin informed the lieutenant that Mark Kilroy was missing [Music] on the second night of their vacation marks group ventured to the city of Madame Morros in northeastern Mexico located in the state of Tamaulipas on the bank of the Rio Grande River Madame Oros is directly across the border from the city of Brownsville on the southernmost tip of Texas with a population of over a million people Madame Morros was a hotspot for drug trafficking but was considered a safe destination for travelers the area offered cheap alcohol and elack's drinking laws during America's youth to the festive local bars nightclubs and restaurants moving between Brownsville and Matamoros required crossing over the Rio Grande via the Gateway International Bridge an official port of entry along the two country's borders on Sunday March 12 1989 mark Kilroy and his crew drove to Brownsville where they left their car before walking across the Gateway International Bridge into Mexico they spent the night socializing at sergeant Pepper's night club until around 2:30 a.m. when they returned to Texas and made their way back to South Padre Island the group decided to venture back to Matamoros the following night of Monday March 13 the city was a hive of activity with approximately 15,000 spring breakers traversing the crowded main streets the four friends wandered down the first thoroughfare after the bridge the nightclub lined Avenida alvaro obregon bill Huddleston described to the area it was like an amusement park but without the rides it was one big thrill the energy that was created by thousands and thousands of students they entered the bar with the shortest line our front lost sombreros then headed to the Hard Rock Cafe where mark met some girls and separated from his friends the crowds were dispersing by 2:00 a.m. and Bill suggested to Bradley and Brent that they'd go back to their hotel the trio exited the bar and spotted mark talking to a girl he had befriended on South Padre Island two days earlier he rejoined to the group as they slowly made their way down the few blocks towards the Gateway International Bridge the four tried to stay close to one another in a shoulder-to-shoulder formation but inevitably split into pairs as they navigated the thousands of intoxicated students moving aimlessly around the streets Bradley and Brent were ahead with Bill and Mark a few yards behind when they reached the front of Garcia's a one-story red and gray brick building that served as a local watering hole and gift shop mark stopped to say goodbye to the girl he'd been speaking to as bill ran off to find somewhere secluded to urinate when bill reemerged mark was nowhere to be seen assuming he must have continued onwards bill reached the bridge where Bradley and Brent were waiting they called out for mark but he didn't appear they were immediately concerned mark wasn't the type to abandon the group or go elsewhere where they are telling them thinking mark may have already crossed the bridge his friends returned to Brownsville but he wasn't waiting by their car as anticipated after waiting several minutes they headed back into Matamoros to search for him they scale at the nightclubs and bars until 4:30 a.m. by which point the streets were mostly empty but they couldn't find mark anywhere the trio drove back to South Padre Island hoping he had returned to their hotel on his own but there was no sign of him there either the group considered the possibility that mark had been thrown in jail and returned to Matamoros the following day to check the local police stations but to no avail officers expressed that little concern as visiting students were often reported missing while partying in town but typically reappeared unharmed a few days later with nothing more than a hangover certain this wasn't the case with mark his friends went back to Brownsville to speak with police there lieutenant George Gavita suggested that mark may have left with the girl he had spent the night talking to but his friends insisted he was not that type of person and would never leave without telling them his plans lieutenant give itto filed a missing-persons report and Bill Brandt and Bradley visited the US consulate while intermittently returning to their hotel to check if Mark had returned when Mark hadn't shown up by 11 p.m. on Tuesday night they contacted his parents James and Helen the Kilroy family were close-knit with Mark the oldest of two sons bill Huddleston recalled feeling a tremendous sense of loss breaking the news as the reality of the situation sunk in mark's unexplained if disappearance was of great concern to his parents as their clean-cut firstborn was not a big partier nor was he allude for careless but a leader who always gave 110 percent he excelled both academically and athletically as a former Boy Scout on his student and student council member who was skilled at basketball baseball and golf following high school mark earned a basketball scholarship that he put aside to focus on his goal to become a general practice doctor his former high school basketball coach Terry Ray stated you always knew whatever he was doing out there if it was mark it would be okay Mark's uncle worked at the u.s. custom service in Los Angeles and too used his connections to draw more attention to his nephews disappearance a task force the front the search was established in Brownsville despite American police having no jurisdiction to investigate in Mexico Mexican police attempted to shift blame by alleging mark had disappeared in Texas even though his friends firmly denied these claims realizing the incident may discourage Spring Breakers from returning to Matamoros government officials pressured local police to act within 48 hours of Mark's disappearance the Mexican federal and state judicial police joined the u.s. task force as investigators on both sides of the border checked hotels hospitals jails and to morgues after three days of unsuccessful searching Mark's friends were asked to reenact the events leading to his disappearance as the last one to have seen mark bill Huddleston was placed under hypnosis to see if his subconscious memory had retained any key detail he described walking past the Garcias and citing a Hispanic male with a cut on his cheek and wearing a blue plaid shirt the stranger motioned to mark in English and he stopped to talk later bill told The Washington Post the newspaper that he heard the men ask hey don't I know you from somewhere bill clarified it was just a glimpse I don't even know if Mark entered him [Music] within days Texan newspapers were reporting on the baffling case the kilroy family offered a $5,000 reward for information with the James and Helen voicing concerns that their son may have been abducted Helen explained I'm extremely worried about him because he's pretty responsible being the person that he is he would have contacted us or his friends mark was of legal drinking age and had joined his friends in consuming alcohol but he had no interest in drugs a devout Catholic he took his faith seriously often carrying a Bible that he'd read between studying although outgoing and fun he was cautious and safe Brent Martin quote I've known the guy ever since kindergarten he wouldn't go off and just not call us he's really smart that's why this whole thing is so weird because as smart as he is he would figure out a way to get in touch with us police were starting to suspect mark may have been attacked robbed or fallen victim to drug-related violence and checked madam Morris's shantytowns and colonias known for their high crime rates bill Huddleston's hypnosis induced memories led some to theorize mark had been murdered as part of a botched kidnapping for ransom plot as many tourists were still coming and going from the city a these were urged to solve the case quickly to ensure no one else fell victim to a similar fate James Kilroy arrived in Brownsville spending long hours each day speaking with investigators developing strong connections with local reporters and handing out missing-person flyers in South Padre and Matamoros assisted by volunteers Ellen Kilroy remained by their home phone in nearby Santa Fe in case it rang with any news convinced that her son was being held against his will she felt a haunting sense that he was being harmed every time she read her Bible quote I've really felt strongly that somehow he's being hurt right now I kept the reading that nothing is impossible with God I feel like Mark's going to come back to us whoever has him I just don't want them to be so frightened that they would fatally hurt mark we don't have any anger toward that person we just want Mark back with everyone praying like this I don't see how the Lord can refuse us by Saturday March 18 ad off is's were involved in the search a police helicopter skiing to the banks of the Rio Grande River as officers in four-wheel drives

student all of which occurred within five blocks of the Gateway International Bridge in Brownsville fundraisers increased the reward pool to $15,000 which was a significant amount in Matamoros when daily wages averaged around two to three dollars but despite the reward and investigative efforts leads were already drying up almost two weeks after mark vanished his disappearance was featured in a ten-minute segment of Fox television's America's Most Wanted that was broadcast in the u.s. sent to Mexico generating a total of 2,000 calls from the public a Mexican woman called to implicate her boyfriend and Madame morose police officer who spoke of arresting a drunk American fitting Marc's description after a failed attempt to extort money from the American the officer shot him as police corruption was a serious problem in Mexico investigators honed in on an officer with ties to the criminal underworld but he was ultimately ruled out calls placed Marc at various Mexican beaches while some saw him in the company of a woman and others claimed he was restrained investigators noticed that references to occult rituals and sacrifices kept cropping up including a letter delivered to police that was covered in scribblings of pentagrams and other symbols it featured a single sentence in Spanish that translated to Marc was not the first Helen Kilroy received a collect call from a man identifying himself as Danny claiming to have seen Marc at a drug dealers house in the city of Houston Texas Danny demanded $10,000 for all the information he knew Helen agreed and arranged to meet him outside a gas station at 5:00 p.m. the following day covert police officers overseeing their exchange noted several suspicious people milling around but Danny did not approach another call came later that night this time from a man calling himself Jr who had noticed the police presence at the drop site a second exchange was arranged for the next day at a nearby cemetery Jr threatened to cut off marks fingers and send them to Helen if the police were notified this time at 5:00 p.m. on April 6 Helen went to the cemetery as arranged once again under covert surveillance but no one came forward to collect the ransom investigators traced the calls to phones inside the Galveston County Jail in Texas they were positioned in the souls of two inmates Robert Miller and a Wilton Smith and were only supposed to be used to contact family and attorneys both men were serving time for burglary and Miller had previously been charged with extortion after attempting to scam money from the

Dunkel 22 year-old Elio Hernandez Rivera the organization's leader undercover officers in an unmarked police vehicle tailed Seraphin 20 miles west arriving at a small cattle ranch titled Rancho Santa Helena they pulled off the main road and kept a watch from a distance when Seraphin left the property 30 minutes later they drove down the half mile long dirt driveway and pulled up to a large corrugated steel warehouse with a red-brown wooden shack to its left pens for livestock and a number of new and high-end cars and trucks parked out the front a man approached and introduced himself as Domingo the ranchers caretaker the officers pretended they were lost tenth in need of directions as one spoke with Domingo another got out and examined a blue Chevrolet Suburban SUV that was parked nearby it was fitted with a car phone which was a luxury feature in 1989 and contained traces of marijuana there was also a cement statue in the vehicle with an evil looking pointed head and facial features made of seashells sensing the caretaker was becoming nervous the officers left the scene although they had been under the impression the Hernandez family's drug smuggling Network was on the wane the expensive vehicles that the ranch led police to believe they were back in business the property was put under surveillance and agents were sent out to determine the group's activities size and connections meanwhile the statue in the blue Chevrolet was identified as a leg wha a god from Paulo enough Rho cubed religion devoted to earthly powers and the worship of spirits Allegro was

that his employers had been arrested when questioned by police Domingo said roughly three to four weeks prior a tall blond haired a young man was in the back of the blue Chevrolet Suburban bound and blindfolded the captives spoke English which Domingo couldn't understand as he only spoke Spanish he was kept in the vehicle overnight and feeling sorry for him Domingo fed him and gave him water the bosses thought the prisoner away in the morning and Domingo didn't know what happened to him after that when shown a photo of Mark Kilroy Domingo stated yes that's him following this revelation police intensive their interrogations of the four men in custody until Seraphin finally cracked he explained that the group belonged to a religious sect led by a cuban-american sorcerer named Adolfo DeJesus Constanzo referred to as their Godfather over the previous month's Constanzo had ordered his followers to conduct several sacrificial rituals believing they would bring strength abundance immunity from injury and protection from law enforcement in a calm and deadpan manner Seraphin revealed that Mark Kilroy had been killed as part of these rituals quote it was our religion el voodoo the following day of Tuesday April 11 investigators from Mexico and the United States descended on rancho santa elena they escorted seraphim to the property whose ongoing relaxed demeanor earth to mexican officers who beat him with their clubs and pants believing he lacked remorse or fear of consequences investigators approached the wooden shack alongside the warehouse and were met with the stench of death the Mexican police expressed hesitancy to go inside due to their fear of witchcraft superstition and belief in the occult were fairly widespread in Mexico with people from all backgrounds believing in witches shamans and sorcerers as well as negative auras curses and spells Purves potions charms and magical amulets were sold in markets and rituals were performed to cure will repel a

candles for kettles contained a dead rooster a goat's head a turtle coins twigs and an Allegro statue the floor was littered with tequila bottles coins half smoked cigars and chili peppers dried blood

strands of hair and what appeared to be human remains Seraphin said Mark Kilroy brains were in the pot the Mexican investigators forced him to drag it outside and to then immediately conducted a ceremony to drive away the evil spirits firing their machine guns into the air before rushing into the shack to destroy its contents dousing everything in holy water American investigators were stunned by the actions of their Mexican counterparts and their lack of concern for maintaining the integrity of the crime scene or photographing it before its destruction but were reluctant to intervene after the shacks contents had been destroyed the police asked Sarafine where mark was buried he gestured to a spot in one of the livestock pens and said over there in the corner protruding two to three feet out of the dirt was a long piece of wire which Seraphin claimed was attached to marks bond or cord so that once his body had decomposed they would be able to pull it out and wear it as a necklace surfing was handed a shovel and forced the dig up marks remains himself as he worked he remarked I don't know why they're making such a big deal of this one here there's another guy buried over there and another guy buried over there when asked to clarify this statement Sarafine responded oh yeah we have other people buried out here [Music] simplify your mornings and evenings

in the midst of a killing field the four suspects were forced to dig up the remaining bodies at gunpoint with officers telling them you'll do it with your hands if you have to a press conference was held in Brownsville where County Sheriff Alex Perez explained it was horrible it was like a human slaughterhouse lieutenant George Gavita added I've been an investigator for 15 years and it's one of the worst things I've ever seen in total seven victims were uncovered in the pen and six more throughout the property all were male and had been severely mutilated several had been skinned and one was charred a second farm owned by the Hernandez family called Rancho Lost Leonys located two miles south was also searched resulting in the discovery of two more bodies within 48 hours of news breaking about the mass grave all the hotel rooms and rental cars in the Rio Grande Valley were booked out as reporters from across the world flocked to cover the story journalists described to those involved

Hernandez Garcia Elio Hernandez Rivera David Serna Valdez and Sergio Martinez Salinas were paraded across a balcony at the Mexican federal judicial police headquarters in Matamoros the informal press conference turned into a raucous affair as the men fielded questions from the hundreds of international reporters gathered below Elio explained they acted because of their religion describing himself as his Colts ordained executioner priest a police officer pulled down a Leo's shirt revealing carvings across his arms chest and back which Elio said represented his license to kill the perpetrators sincerely believed their rituals had made them impervious to the police with Sarafine challenging an officer to shoot him then and there quote go ahead your bullets will just bounce off arrest warrants were issued for other alleged cult members including its ringleader 26 year old Adolfo DeJesus Constanzo her paper trail revealed that the morning after Serafina and his co-accused were taken into custody Constanzo and three of his followers boarded a flight from Texas to Mexico City but their current whereabouts were unknown Constanzo was born and raised in Miami by his Cuban mother Dalia throughout his childhood Constanzo traveled with his mother to Haiti where he learned about and developed an interest in food ooh by age 14 he apprenticed a local practitioner of my embarr a branch of the paulo religion considered to be the world's most powerful and feared form of black magic constanzo's neighbors in Miami who fell foul of the family started finding headless goats and chickens on their doorsteps believed to have been left by Dahlia who they suspected to be a witch Constanzo eventually relocated to Mexico City where he pursued modeling work while supporting himself financially by reading tarot cards he amassed followers from all walks of life several of whom became his lovers by the time he was in his early 20s Constanzo had established himself as a powerful Godfather performing spells for people down on their luck his customers included physicians politicians models film stars and police officers he spells often required animal sacrifices ranging from roosters goats and snakes to zebras and lion cubs the latter cost him upwards of $3,000 he even raided a graveyard to obtain human bones to use in his potions Constanzo had learned from his own occult godfather who had earned his riches from drug dealers discovering he could profit from the foolishness of others he dedicated himself to spirits associated with criminals and criminal activity and began offering drug cartels spells of protection from rivals and law enforcement this earned him large amounts of money and clout in 1987 he approached one of his biggest clients requesting to become a full business partner with a 50% cut of sales when his request was denied the cartel leader and six of his family members and associates were found floating in the Rio de San Pongo canal with multiple body parts missing including toes ears parts testicles brains and in one case a spine in July 1987 Constanzo met a college student named Sara Aldrete who had romantic the links to drug dealers and soon indoctrinated the 22 year old into his religious practices Aldrete his classmates noticed the dramatic shift in her personality as the otherwise polite straight-a student had seemingly become an expert on witchcraft and black magic overnight she started wearing black clothing and preaching the powers of darkness and delight at her parents house in Matamoros she decorated her bedroom with occult paraphernalia including an altar she prayed before every night Constanzo made our dritt a a high priestess and his second-in-command the godmother of his cult and in November that year she put him in touch with the Hernandez family the Hernandez family turned to Constanzo following the murder of their ringleader Sol Hernandez Rivera who had been gunned down presumably by rival drug dealers Constanzo told the family that dedicating themselves to Palo Mayombe would grow their business eliminate their enemies and make them invincible to law enforcement in exchange he required 50% of their profits and co ownership of the business they agreed and in early 1989 Elio Sarafine and several others were initiated into constanzo's cult undergoing rituals involving animal sacrifice business increased strengthening their belief in the practice Constanzo moved his headquarters to Rancho Santa Elena where the rituals escalated to include human sacrifices Constanzo told his flock that mutilation and pain were essential to palo mayombe and that the spirits he worshiped would be further appeased if their sacrifice died in agony he then introduced sodomy to their list of torches over a nine-month period the cult killed mostly rival drug dealers and others who had crossed them in one instance they plan to sacrifice a former member but he pulled out a gun and was promptly shot dead angered by this botched ritual Elio ordered his men to abduct the first person they could find so the sacrifice could still go ahead they brought him a boy with a burlap sack over his head and elio hastily decapitated him only to discover that it was his fourteen-year-old cousin in February 1989 Constanzo stole 800 kilograms of marijuana from a rival gang to ensure it's safe shipment across the Rio Grande he ordered another human sacrifice on Monday March 13 her drug dealer was taken to rancho santa elena with each cult member taking turns cutting and kicking him but their captive didn't make a sound during the attack the silence irritated Constanzo as he believed suffering and pain were essential to gain power from the ritual so he started skinning the men alive when he still refused The Scream Constanzo executed him with a machete deeming the sacrifice worthless he demanded his followers bring him another victim someone with a good brain that he could feed to the spirits that lived inside he's in Gaga to make them smarter he told his followers bring me someone I can use someone who will scream at around 1:30 a.m. on March 14 Serafina and another cult member drove into Matamoros and reached the main strip of Avenida Alvaro Obregon where they spotted a Mark Kilroy outside of Garcia's they pulled up alongside him and asked if he needed a ride Nach admitted he was drunk and requested a lift to Brownsville to meet up with his friends Serafina great and Mark pawned into the pickup as they approached the Gateway International Bridge surfing made a right turn onto a bumpy road framed by a hood levee that ran parallel with the Rio Grande he stopped the car in a parking lot and Mark was left alone as his two companions got out to urinate realizing something wasn't right Mark scrambled out of the truck and took off in the direction of the border even though the levy made it impossible to cross as he ran david Serna valdez and sergio martinez salinas arrived following behind in the blue Chevrolet Suburban they chased the mark down and ordered him to freeze telling him he was under arrest for public intoxication mark stopped and was bound and blindfolded with duct tape then forced into the back of the Chevy by the time the group returned to the ranch it was almost 3 a.m. Sarafine gave mark some crackers and water reassuring him that nothing was going to happen he then phoned his godmother Sara Aldrete telling her we've done what he asked for early the next morning mark was removed from the truck and placed in a hammock between two trees by midday eight more cult members had arrived to participate in the sacrificial ceremony including Constanzo Elio and RJ Constanzo believed women were bad luck for worship and as the other men would be naked during the ritual Aldrete was required to stay outside mark was taken into the wooden shack where he was forced to kneel before Constanza and endure extreme acts of torture and sexual assault surfing claimed he was outside when he heard a heavy thudding sound akin to the slicing of a coconut he was then ordered to go inside the shack and quote take him out upon entering he saw mark gilroys naked body alongside a bloody machete his head cracked open surfing could see his brains had been removed and placed inside the inn Ganga he alleged Constanzo was the one who carried out the murder another member cut at marks heart holding it up and declaring my soul is dead I am NOT a human being Constanza awarded a marks legs to be cut off and he was buried in a shallow 1 metre deep grave on Saturday April 15 Mark Kilroy Was fair world at his family's Church Our Lady of Lourdes his younger brother Keith told the crowd of 1000 mourners mark loved to life he loved society he was very trusting and to that same society that he loved so much has taken him away from us and because of them we have to spend the rest of our lives without him Reverend - John the fork declared Mark's death was not in vain quote God allows us to see the ugliness the depraved and the senseless killing so we might open our minds and hearts to become an answer to these horrible problems in the world the Kilroy family derived comfort knowing that Mark had time to pray before his death which had ultimately put a stop to the senseless killings a family friend too later told producers of the documentary deadly cults they honestly really really felt like everything happened to her a reason that this was genuinely God's plan this happened to mark because without them finding mark who knows how long it would have taken to find all the other bodies mark was the instrument to show the evil of what this cult can do mark was laid to rest in the Mount Olivet Catholic cemetery in Dickinson Texas with his headstone reading we are proud of mark and we thank God for the way mark was and the way we were when with him mark is with God do not be sad for mark be sad for yourselves and us because another good man is missing from our world he was a best friend to all the families of other victims were left equally broken although many suspected their loved ones had met with foul play when they vanished and took the disappearance of an American tourist before the case received police and media attention despite this the parents of the youngest victim 14-year old Jose Luis Garcia Luna harbored no resentment Jose's mother told a reporter for the Brownsville Herald if it weren't for the Kilroy boy none of the other men including my son would ever have been found meanwhile an international manhunt was underway for those responsible for the killings with reported sightings coming from as far away as Chicago a radio broadcast the warmth that Sara Aldrete had been spotted near a school in southern Texas and had promised to kidnap and murder ten children for every cult member that was captured fearful parents kept their children home from school until the threat was determined to have arisen from a prank phone call as the cult had operations on both sides of the border it was difficult to determine where exactly the fugitives were heading although records showed Constanzo and his crew had flown from Texas to Mexico City following the initial arrests authorities believed the leader was ultimately heading for his hometown of Miami or perhaps to Houston where he

by Constanzo during the gun battle who told his followers no one's going to have this money after the group initially fled from Texas following the raid on rancho santa elena they disguised themselves but dyeing their hair and wearing sunglasses and hats and kept a low profile in the outskirts of Mexico City when Constanzo saw the news footage of hissing Ganga being destroyed he screamed and fired his machine gun at the television fearful that his powers had been diminished on April 25 the fugitives returned into Mexico City moving between the apartments of their associates before finally

them that in this building at those they are seeking tell them that a woman is being held hostage but begged for this because what I want most is to talk or they're going to kill the girl the note was found by two young men walking on the street below one looked up and made eye contact with our dritt a but he thought it was just a joke and didn't hand the note to authorities until after the shooter sir Aldrete omorrow Raya and Alvaro de Leon Valdes were placed under arrest Aldrete portrayed herself as a victim of the cult claiming she had been taken hostage and forced to go along with the group's demands she denied any involvement in the sacrificial rituals saying she felt sorry for the Kilroy family and revealing she had volunteered to help James Kilroy hand out his son's missing person posters yet evidence indicated Audra Tay was a willing participant in the cults activities she was able to describe several of the murders in detail and failed to provide any proof that she had been abducted each of the seven arrested cult members face the different charges based on their involvement in the 15 murders including those of cult members Constanzo and Martin Quintana Rodriguez some also faced the charges for drug trafficking criminal association and coverup as well as burial narcotics and weapons violations the trials commenced in July of 1989 but given the huge amount of paperwork the presiding judge had to examine it took her years to reach a conclusion O'Mara Raya died from AIDS mid trial in February 1990 in August that same year Alvaro de Leon Valdez was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murders of Constanzo and cantana in May 1994 five years after the cult was uncovered Sara Aldrete Sarafine Hernandez Garcia Elio Hernandez Rivera and the two men who captured mark and drove him to the ranch David's Erna Valdez and Sergio Martinez Salinas we're each sentenced to 67 years a federal court later reduced their sentences to 50 years after the court ruled it was the maximum they should have received under met second law if they are ever released from prison American authorities planned to prosecute them for the murder of mark Kilroy Sara Aldrete quote I am sorry because of all the things that happened I'm sorry because of all the killing I don't know how I got into this without knowing what it was constanzo would order you to do something and you would do it but I don't know why he was like a leader or something we were like followers as the life sentences and the death penalty did not exist in the Mexican judicial system the kilroy family and US officials expressed satisfaction with the outcome Helen Kilroy told reporters quote we were concerned that maybe they weren't going to get sentenced that they were going to let things quiet down and to be released but I'm glad those fears were unfounded I think we and to the people of Mexico can feel safer brownsville sheriff's lieutenant george Gavita who was the first to law enforcement official to learn of mark's disappearance said i just really commend the mexican government for doing it i think it sends a message over here to us that justice was done over there three of the cult's victims were never identified and two mexican authorities suspect Constanzo had ritualistically murdered another 16 children a pair of children's shoes were uncovered at the ranch and the baby's belongings including photographs were found near the bloody el tajin Sara Aldrete bedroom there were also unsubstantiated reports that a small human skull was found in constanzo's and Gaga although the media followed the more sensationalist Satanism angle the Kilroy family believed the real problem was drug-related violence in northern Mexico in May 1989 they founded the Mark Kilroy Foundation which provides drug education to young people they met with then President George Bush and made appearances on talk shows in churches and on the steps of Austin State Capitol to promote their cause Helen Kilroy told the New York Times we've stopped and wondered what we were doing several times but I think we were meant to do this because at every bad moment we hear from somebody and addict a parent that has lost a child somebody who says they want us to keep going in 2009 as the 20th anniversary of Mark's death approached the cure Royce visited madam Morris and the Rio Grande Valley to thank the locals who helped find their son in December 2014 Helen Curie passed away at the age of 70 her funeral was held in the same church where Mark had been fair world 25 years earlier
