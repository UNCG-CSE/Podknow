how does a young black women born in racially charged in segregated Birmingham Alabama in 1954 find the confidence and the belief to know that she could grow up to be one of the world's most powerful leaders she's been called one of the most influential women in the world and moment of national crisis from 9/11 to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq she was involved in some of the most controversial decisions in our nation's history and the decision she made will be debated by historians for generations to come he was Stanford University's first female non-white Provost the first black woman to serve as National Security advisor and the very first black woman to become Secretary of State in 2004 here's a woman who accomplish your dreams without losing sight of her commitment always be trueto herself everybody has a story and there is something to be learned from every experience use your life as a class this is master class with dr. Condoleezza Rice I know that I could have been better at almost everything that I've done I could have been better as National Security adviser I'm sure of it maybe their questions I didn't ask maybe there are things I didn't probe I could have been better I don't have any doubt about that I could have been better at secretary of state but I think I did okay under the circumstances I think I did okay when I think of who I am I think of myself as a black woman from Birmingham Alabama who was fortunate enough to find what she was really passionate about doing who loves her country despite its fullest maybe because of its walls and who keeps at the center of her heart parents who gave me every opportunity that they possibly could what I'm asked will how did it feel to be the first black fill in the blank or the first woman fill in the blank have a look I can't go back and recreate myself as a white male and tell you how it would have felt if I've been a white male I'm a package I'm kinda Lisa Rice I'm 5 7 and 3/4 I'm Black and I'm female and it all kind of goes together I'm very proud of the fact that our country has come as far as it has so that we're talking about the first black female Secretary of State who won thought it'd 40 years ago when I was growing up in Birmingham Alabama I'm the descendant of slaves just a few Generations removed this country has a terrible birth defect of slavery and I don't believe that we are now nor do I think we're ever likely to be certainly not in my lifetime race-blind it just is too much to ask given our own history but the nice thing is that we no longer have preconceptions about who somebody is or what they might do because they look a certain way in order to know who I became you had to know John and Angelina rice my parents they were extraordinary Ordinary People I've called them mom was a school teacher daddy was a high school guidance counselor later on today University administrator and I think they instilled in me a sense that I could do just about anything that I wanted to do and I think the fact that they race a little girl who believe that she could do great things but it was always searching for what might that be was really a terrific active parenting I just think that they gave me Limitless Horizons and that's probably the best thing parents can give kids I'm fortunate that to my father who was present during minister in the Theologian always challenged me to think about my faith so that when things are difficult I have that to turn to when your intellect can't explain now the death of your mother for me when she was 61 I was 30 or the death of your father when he was in his late seventies those are the kinds of trials and tribulations that can only be overcome by faith it's very difficult to separate myself in my Evolution from the circumstances of Birmingham first of all it was a scary place in 1962 and 1963 all of those images that are now pretty far back in our nation's historical memory we're very much the memories that shaped who I am Birmingham was the most segregated big city in America this was a place where the public safety commissioner Bull Connor along with course Governor George Wallace was known to be just hardcore segregationist is a little girl growing up I didn't have any by classmates any why teachers we rarely interacted with white people but Birmingham also had another side of which was the side that was a group of people who are determined to overcome a group of people who are determined to prove himself despite the circumstances we had ballet lessons and we had French lessons we even had lessons in Etiquette what Fork to use so the parents were determined to prepare their kids to be really excellent it also an extremely high expectations you were always told you might have to be twice as good and that wasn't actually a matter for debate it was sort of a fact that was stated and there are no excuses for poor performance in school or for poor performance at anything and so it was a wonderful combination of a community that was in some ways so segregated that they rigorously control the messages that we received and that message was it may be a very racist place and you may not be able to control your circumstances but you can show control how you react to your circumstances and here's how you react you're twice as good you work hard you do everything better than they might do it in 1960 to 1963 when the Civil Rights Movement really centered in Birmingham and when things began to get very violent it was a place that really did evoke a lot of fear Knight Riders and the Klu Klux Klan and all of those images Birmingham was beginning to be known as bombing ham because there were so unsolved bombings including one in our neighborhood and of course in September of 1963 when the 16th Street Baptist Church was bombed in those four little girls were killed everybody knew at least one of them Denise McNair had been in my father's kindergarten I played with her she was a little friend then it was harder for parents to really separate their kids and somehow Shield their kids from the awfulness of what was going on in Birmingham just remember that night asking my parents if I could sleep in their bed which probably was a sign of how really scared I was and at that point I think they just held this close and they they just tried to put their arms around us and there was always a Bedrock feeling that it was going to be okay in the loving Embrace of our parents in our community I do think that those of us who grew up in segregation were able to spot at a hundred Paces when somebody was under estimating you and when somebody underestimated me it made me want to prove them wrong a lot of what goes on in Washington in the White House is just Turf Enos and pure Consciousness until you have to try to that take it personally but I knew that I was younger by maybe a couple of decades then many of the people with whom I was going to be working especially the second time around When is National Security advisor wasn't on guard for whether somebody underestimated what I could do that isn't the way that those lessons coming to play the way that it comes into play is that if someone comes to closer steps on something that you think is your responsibility then you're not at all shy about saying move away get out of my way and I think that toughness and the White House really does come from being a young kid who was always determined that nobody was going to underestimate you and you were going to do what you were going to do and I can remember going to President Bush on at least one occasion and saying that person that ever does that to me again then one of us is resigning what are the things that I often tell my students who want to plan every step in life they want to know what they're going to be doing when they're 30 or 40 or even 50 years old and usually comes in the form of a question how do I get to be who you are and I mean how do I get to be Secretary of State and I say will you start out as a failed piano major and you go from there you can't plan every step in life I was always going to be a great concert pianist I was studying piano from the age of three I could read music before I could read I studied I worked hard I want a couple piano competitions my sophomore year in college when I hit was a piano major I went off that summer to the Aspen Music Festival school and I met 12 year olds who could play from site what it it taken me all year to learn I was about seventeen and I thought oh my goodness there's a whole world out there of talent that I will never match and I really didn't want to teach piano and I thought I'm going to end up teaching 13 year old to murder Beethoven and maybe I'll play piano bar someplace but I'm not headed to Carnegie Hall and I was really pretty devastated by because my entire life had been aimed at being a great concert pianist so I went off to my parents who live about 5 minutes from the University and Mom and Dad I need to talk to you and my father said to what are you changing your major I said well I don't know but I'm changing my major is if you don't know what you want to do with your life and this is kind of a shock because my parents had always been very supportive about all of my decision and I said well it's after all my life and they said yes but it's an hour and it can you find a major so I tried very hard nothing stuck and finally I wandered into a course in international politics and it was taught by the Soviet specialist a man named Josef Korbel Madeleine Albright's father and it was like finding love I'd find my passion I knew I wanted to do things Russian I wanted to do things International I remember the very lecture that led me there it was about Joseph Stalin and the Byzantine politics of with late 20s in the Soviet Union and suddenly I knew what I wanted to do and I'm quite convinced that a lot of My Success has been because I was doing something that I love to do and I wanted to get up and I wanted to read more no more about the Soviet Union than anybody else and so it wasn't a chore to go to school and it wasn't a chore to learn Russian and it wasn't a chore to work hard it was a joy one of the hardest things to explain this the role of serendipity in life because it's the one thing you can't control it's very hard to say to my students sometimes you know I was a bit lucky I was a bit fortunate that I was in a seminar at Stanford in the early 1980s with a man named Brent scowcroft came out to speak and I asked him a relatively rude question which he actually didn't take offense at but kind of liked my spots and so he came up and we started to talk and he became a real Mentor for me he asked me to join something called Aspen strategy Group which was a group of foreign policy was established in people who met every year in Aspen for several days and that's kind of how I got guided into the foreign policy establishment I do think that your life is some combination of what you do and what you were meant to do some combination of working hard and having the right skill rules and listening for that little voice that tells you know that isn't it you're going in the wrong direction there's been times when I didn't know if I was headed in the right direction and I went through a period of time where I didn't want to do a PhD I thought of phds as people who sat in rooms and wrote books that nobody read and yet I ended up there because I kept seeking further knowledge in something that I love I believe in always trying to do the thing that you're doing very well that allows you to be very focused as so when I was Special Assistant to President George HW Bush I tried to be the very best Special Assistant that I could be I was with President Bush of course in 1990 when Gorbachev came to visit the United States and he decided to visit California on that trip and so President Bush called me into the Oval Office he said you know Gorbachev was going to go out to Stanford that's your home I want you to take him and so there we are sitting on Marine One the presidential helicopter on this just Gorbachev and me and I thought glad I changed my major Wright call I have a very strong belief that preparation counts that you do have to work hard but that it also matters where you are and who you meet and being in the right place at the right time and so you should never ever take for granted what you're given than what you've been able to achieve you should never assume that it was just through your own smart sand because you were so much better than everybody else that you got there there are so many people who were as good as you were maybe even better who never quite made it to that place and I try very hard to remember that I've been I've been good but I've been lucky and fortunate and blessed there is no doubt September 11th is one of those days that will be forever seared on our Consciousness we all remember where we were what we were doing and most important we were feeling and we all remember that day from our point of you imagine what it was like to be the National Security advisor on that day the chocolate comes when you find out that this is an attack and it is your job to keep the country safe you are the security advisor how do you get through something so horrific there's no precedent in the United States and no rules or handbook to lean on as much as I believe intellectually we did everything we could from what we knew to prevent such an attack there's always a little piece of you that says maybe there's more I could have done the September 11th is one of those days that every American remembers where they were but if you were in a position of authority it was a day that I made every day after September 12th on the day of September 11th it was like any other Tuesday morning I was at my desk it was a little odd and that President Bush had gone down to Florida for an education event and usually either Steve Hadley the deputy National Security advisor or I would have gone with him but was only going to be gone a few hours so we decided all he should just go with the Amore junior staff member and so my assistant came in and he said a plane hit the World Trade Center and I thought he meant a small plane and then he said no it's a commercial jetliner so I called President Bush and he said that's a strange accident and I said yes and he said keep me informed so I went downstairs and I was having my morning staff meeting and I would go around the table and I got to about the third person in and they handed me a note in the set of second plane hit the World Trade Center. Oh my God this is a terrorist attack I went into the Communication Center and I was trying to reach the other National Security Council principals yes CIA directorate already gone to the bunker their colon Powell was actually improve and I couldn't reach Don Rumsfeld and I looked behind me and a plane had hit the Pentagon and then there was a false report of a Car Bomb haven't gone off at the state department in right then the Secret Service came to me and they said you have got to go to the bunker right now and they so sweet you up and they start to carry you along and I said I have to make a phone call actually called my aunt and uncle in Birmingham and I said they're going to be terrible pictures coming up of Washington tell everybody I'm alright and I hung up I didn't even wait for them to answer and then I called President Bush and I did something that I had never done before and I never did since which was I I raised my voice the president United States I said stay where you are he said I'm coming back I said no you're not Washington's under attack I then went down to the bunker and the vice president was there he was on the phone with President Bush and he was getting authorization that if another plane was not responding properly that the Air Force should shoot it down and then suddenly a plane disappeared somewhere over Pennsylvania and for an awful 15 minutes we thought that we'd shot that plane down I remember thinking at that moment the how horrible it would be if indeed the American Air Force headshot down innocent civilians but it was a necessary evil during that whole time and everything that would transpire after you learn that you're very often balancing you're very often weighing unpalatable choices it's not so black-and-white it's not this is good and that's bad very often very often you have bad Alternatives and you're trying to choose between them very often you're weighing competing values if you're going to have a strike against a terrorist camp and the terrorist Camp is embedded in a village where civilians might die what do you do do you take out the terrorist Camp knowing that they could kill 3,000 people as they did on September 11th how do you weigh that against the innocent lives of civilians some of whom may even be human shields for the terrorist until I learned in this incredibly difficult time this Crucible through which we went got these things are rarely black and white Faith helps because you pray for guidance dumping a really religious person prays believing to hear the voice of God tell you do this not that but you certainly hope that all of the belief that you've had and that you've held for all of those years is going to somehow come together to make you wiser in the choices that you are going to make but they also tell you that these decisions are black and white there's a good and there's a bad sometimes sometimes if it's a taking of innocent lives by the terrorists to Justice going to do it because wants to make a political Point yeah that's just bad that's just evil there is no compromise there but very often you find yourself weighing hard hard decisions words metal black and white what struck me during the entire. After September 11th to degree to which the common values of Islam Judaism Christianity really come to the fore and you realize the degree to which the terrorists in the violent people are outside of those common values I don't care whether it's Muhammad or Moses or David or Jesus Christ there have been followers who have used those names to their O'Neill purpose September 11th taught me that there are people in the world who rather harsh to say it if you don't get them before they get you you'll suffer the hardest thing about this terrorist bite we don't have an option to let them commit the crime and then punish it afterwards quite literally we have to get them before they get us my parents are really again the reason that I think I'm very decisive person and that I am a decision maker and I don't mind taking decisions when I was a little girl I've about four years old I became president of the family we had an election every year but it was by secret ballot there were no term limits so I got elected year after year cuz I had my mother's phone I don't know about my father's fault but they really did concoct this ideas so that I would literally call a family meeting so we could decide what time are we leaving for the trip to New York tomorrow or so that we could decide what color are we going to paint the new living room I think it was a wonderful way of giving me a role in the family in terms of decision-making so it was very empowering to use an overused word and from very early on I learned those lessons I taught a course called challenges and dilemmas in u.s. foreign policy they said my students there been a few challenges and dilemmas and I was involved in a lot of them you can think that some of the decisions that I was a part of where the most ridiculous for a stupid decision that you've ever heard but you better know what you're talkin about because I will welcome your opinions but not your uninformed ones I am absolutely grateful that there wasn't another attack in the seven and a half years that we were in office but as I often say to people we have to be right 100% of the time and they have to be right once I think I understand from the inside how hard it is to make sure and the lesson for me is that you need to give some slack some understanding to people who are trying to make it work from the inside I have had the chance to teach my students about the decisions that we took in Afghanistan and Iraq and and obviously about the issues of weapons of mass destruction and the first lesson is that intelligence is never perfect and it might in fact be wrong the fact is in decision-making you don't always have all of the information that you want or need many of the decisions that we took were controversial and there was obviously another side we took the decisions that we thought were best for the country under what I think we're really quite extraordinary circumstances and frankly without a compass because no one had ever been through what we went through there is no doubt that there are many things that we could have done differently than Afghanistan and Iraq it's the nature of big complex operations that you're going to do something while you're not going to force see something it's kind of interesting to me that people say will you didn't plan well we planned and planned and planned sometimes we planned on the wrong assumptions that the araki society was going to hold together and you haven't Place Ministries that could run the Affairs of a rock once you've gotten rid of the top leadership and that didn't hold I had it to do over again I would try and build a rock from the outside-in rather than from the inside out meaning I wouldn't Focus so much and back that focus more in the province's we could have used the tribal structures better as we finally did in 2007 I think the military learned how to fight a counterinsurgency strategy meaning you had to live among the population and protect the population and they would come over to your side rather than just trying to destroy every last two terrorists with how to support the population so there many many lesson send those are fair criticisms but I found it really completely objectionable and I was really angry by people who imputed your motives to those who are making those decisions that somehow we wanted to leave the country into war therefore we concocted ideas about tough what Saddam my daughter this or that nobody wants to go to war nobody in their right mind wants to go to war and so when decisions are taken at least give somebody the benefit of the doubt that perhaps they took them for the right reasons and with the right motivation to even if you don't agree with them so at the beginning of my class I told my students never forget how hard it is to make complex decisions when you don't have all the information that you'd like but you don't have the luxury of not making a decision when I was Provost of Stanford I went to a concert here at Stanford by the great cellist Yo-Yo Ma and he said oh you play the piano. You and I said yes me City arbil play some time and I thought I sure will Jam you and I will do that and he called me when I was back in the White House is National Security advisor my secretary comes in and she says yo yo Ma's on the phone for you I said you mean the cellist and he was going to receive the national medal of the Arts and he wanted to play something with me we played for 2,500 people at Constitution Hall one evening and I thought that's even more confirmation that it was a good thing to change your major because don't be confused you're not playing with Yo-Yo Ma because you're a great pianist you're playing with Yo-Yo Ma because you're the National Security advisor so I've gotten the best of both worlds I got to pursue International politics and do it at the highest level and I got to play with yo yo ball we have this facile way of talking about the world we are all alike we like to say we're all human so we're all alike will actually know we're not we're all very different and that's the wonder of the world that's what makes the world fun to know and to to get to know on on the surface we are like underneath we're actually very different now the key has to be in international Politics the difference isn't a license to Kill and that to makes the world of international politics both fascinating and a little terrifying sometimes I always say that history has a long tail and my career really allowed me to see two very important sets of events in that context I was in the White House on 11/9 when the Berlin Wall fell and I was in the White House on 9/11 when the terrorist attacks took place now 11-9 the fall of the Berlin Wall at all that transpired after that the policies that led to that were actually put in place in 1945 and 1946 and 1947 and while it was unbelievable to be the White House Soviet specialist at the end of the Cold War I had to remind myself that we were really harvesting good decisions that Truman and Atchison and Marshall had taken back when actually things didn't look so bright it's at that time you had said oh by the way, nism is going to end in 40 years in Europe there will be no Communist States people would have had you committed and so I am able to see that that was the result that wonderful outcome the end of Communism in Europe was a result of 40 Years of policy and so if you fast forward for me to September 11th I realized that we were at the front end of another big historical epic and I'll tell you it's a lot more fun to be at the end of historical epic than at the beginning but that is the way that I believe that you have to see what is happening in Afghanistan what is happening in Iraq that these are events that will unfold over a long. Of time and I've had the fortune to be at the end of mist Oracle epic and I guess the challenge of being at the beginning of one after a Monumental political career doctor Condoleezza Rice has returned to her first love and that is teaching at Stanford University and as we've heard in this master class she has plenty to teach how to rise above adversity through Devotion to Excellence how to have the courage to take risks and perhaps above all how to trust ourselves and our instincts if we're following our passions every decision will teaches how to be better at being ourselves which allows us to be the master of our own lives I'm Oprah Winfrey and you've been listening to Master Class the podcast you can follow masterclass on Instagram Twitter and Facebook if you have it already go to Apple podcasts And subscribe rate and review this podcast join me next week for another Master Class podcast
