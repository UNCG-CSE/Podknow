Valentine's Day Massacre became the crime that Mark the end of an era but to truly understand what occurred on that frigate day we have to understand the climate of violence that made such a brutal attack possible Helen Kate will help us by explaining the world of crime that existed before Capone and Moran rise to power from 1900 to 1920 prostitution was a dominant criminal industry with in Chicago and gambling was a close second in the early years of the city's life most brothels and dog tracks were owned and operated by various small-time gangs from the outset these gangs would war on the streets setting off bombs firing guns at assaulting employees of rival establishments for the most part the politicians and the public of Chicago tolerated the violence occurring on the street so they're City the politicians were off in the pockets of the wealthiest monsters and the general public was just happy that the Mobsters usually killed each other this lacks attitude towards crime led the city to become a Haven for those organized criminals who hoped to make their fortunes through less reputable means one of the most influential of these ner do Wells was a man named Jacomo Big Jim colosimo Seema was an Italian born man with family connections to the mafia along with his nephew in law and right-hand man Giovanni Papa Johnny torrio colosimo's outfit claimed most of the territory within the southside of Chicago at the height of his power he owned and operated over 200 brothels throughout the region has Italian Mafia was seizing control of the South Side Chicago is Northern neighborhoods were Haven of recently immigrated Irishman the Irish Community loathed prostitution finding it highly immoral so Irish criminals often spent most of their efforts pursuing other rackets like gambling robbery and general thuggery one of the most prominent Irish gangs at the time was the Market Street gang led by Dean O'Banion with the help of his friends Vincent schemer drucci Earl Hymie Weiss and George Bugs Moran O'Banion and his Market Street gang became professional safecrackers con artist and hired thugs were newspapers and politicians alike for the most part The Market Street gang and the Chicago outfit remained within their own territories throughout the 1910s not interfering in each other's businesses in anyway however fate would soon put them on Collision Course of Bloodshed and conflict the criminal underworld of Chicago change dramatically in 1917 in the United States Congress passed a landmark Bill the eighteenth amendment to the Constitution which band quote the manufacture sale or transportation of intoxicating Liquors Nationwide the bill went into effect in January of 1920 marking the start of prohibition well prohibition put many honest breweries out of business it presented a brand new and Incredibly lucrative opportunity for those entrepreneurs who are willing to break the law to make a little profit O'Banion quickly made inroads with liquor producers in Canada while buying up breweries and equipment from legitimate businessman in the United States with the many political and business connections he had already formed he said up speakeasies and secret liquor stores all across the north side of Chicago what's the predominant gang in the Northside The Market Street gang rapidly expanded its grip and power the prophets o'banion's bootlegging brought in were staggering minion solidified his grip on the Northside Johnny torrio second-in-command of colosimo South Side Chicago outfit saw the money other Bootleggers were bringing in and decided he wanted a piece of the pie Torio brought the idea to colosimo but it didn't go as well as he had hoped say we stay out of liquor we stay out of liquor don't you forget it you can't stop progress gym I love you big Jim but it seems you forced my hand I'm sorry I'm such a fool colosimo refused to enter the liquor business believing his outfit was already stretched too thin running his brothels however Torio is not the kind of man who took no for an answer while colosimo remain obstinate in his refusal to sell booze Toreo met with his Protege twenty-year-old Alphonse Capone and Frankie Yale the national president of the Union speech Ileana the largest Italian crime organization in the United States gentleman I love big Jim more than anybody in this room but he is standing in the way of true greatness Frankie you're more businessman than any I've ever met I'm sure you understand where I'm coming from believe me Torio I sympathize with your situation boot leggings been making us men back in New York so we can expect your support should something happen to our friend Big Jim support hell I'll take care of the situation myself if you know the price is right I'm happy to hear it after having gained the approval of the mafia at large torrio decided to move against his boss Big Jim colosimo on May 11th 1923 old told colosimo to wait at one of his many restaurants for a delivery of stolen goods little did colosimo know he would be waiting for the arrival of something else entirely it's been over an hour how long you going to make me wait till Rio thank God I've been waiting Frankie what are you doing here I've got a message for you Jim a message what kind of message could you possibly have for me it's from Johnny about the liquor he says he's sorry but sorry don't feed me that BS Frankie if you're going to shoot me and get it over with works for me Big Jim colosimo was murdered in his own restaurant by his former colleagues it's unknown who actually pulled the trigger but most evidence points to Frankie Yale as the man who finally put Big Jim out of commission with colosimo out-of-the-way Torio seize control of the Chicago outfit with Al Capone established as his right-hand man in order to honor his former boss Torio arranged for colosimo to have the most extravagant funeral the city of Chicago had ever seen and his body was paraded through the city he had 53 different pallbearers some of them were congressmen and judges and over 1,000 people showed up to mourn his death colosimo's death set of drastic president for the mob now every mob boss and two-bit gangster in Chicago wanted as Grande funeral as colosimo and it wouldn't be long before many of them join colosimo in the grave that would culminate in Massacre sooner than anyone had realized Astoria took control of the Chicago outfit he rapidly expanded his grasp on bootlegging throughout the city however this expansion of influence soon put him in conflict with the other dominant bootlegging forces Dean O'Banion and his predominantly Irish North Side gang effectively eliminated all of his rivals in the Northside of Chicago and use the profits from his bootlicking Ventures to purchase himself a flower shop called schofield's enjoyed arranging flowers almost as much as he enjoyed murdering his Rivals and as he began to use his flower shop as a base of operations he set his sights on territory controlled by Torio the competing factions began setting off bombs in each other's establishments and executing drive-by shootings to scare patrons away however as both the north side gang and the Southside Mafia began to see a dip in their profits from the public sphere of violence Torio always the business-minded criminal wanted to put an end to the war fair at some point in early 1921 Toreo and his right-hand man Capone met with O'Banion and he is right hand man Hymie Weiss O'Banion pleasure to be meeting with you like this I'm glad you're willing to speak to a competitor like me not many people are well all these bullets are bad for the both of us I'd love to come to some kind of arrangement but I need to make it clear the north side belongs to me and I won't budge on that you won't budge in the north we won't budge in the South we all agree on that but ain't that what's gotten us into this mess perhaps there's another option if we each maintain control of our own territories but become partners and other Ventures we can both benefit from each other's successes make it a win-win for all of us and make moving against each other a lose-lose for the both of us if we're splitting profits the war will cost each side equally disincentive Rising ungentlemanly Behavior not a bad idea glad we agree now let's talk specifics shall we toriel and O'Banion came to an agreement splitting the profits from three lucrative casinos restaurants and clubs within each of their territories would not last forever before long bodies would line the streets once again will see the Bloodshed continue after this adventurous and inquisitive you're open to trying new things you're curious about astrology but you don't know how to take

the Italian South Side gang run by Johnny torrio and the Irish North Side gang run by Dean O'Banion the two gangs that come to a peace agreement and it operated his business partners for 3 years however the situation soon began to change when an independent Italian Syndicate call the West Side gang begin to expand their own bootlegging operations the West Side gang was run by a collection of Six Brothers known as the terrible Jenna's and they were true to their name will the gang was Sicilian they had formed outside of torios territory and operated independently from the Chicago outfit entities with separate goals the West Side gang and the South Side gang were largely Allied due to their shared ethnic identities and their Mutual connections within the union a situation as such the West Side gang and the South Side gang had no intention of competing against each other while the South Side gang had to come to an agreement with O'Banion and his North Side gang the Jenna's and their West Side gang had not where the gym is wanted to expand their territory they began pushing into a banyan's lands in the north bringing back the bombings and drive-by shootings that had plagued the north side streets only three years earlier naturally O'Banion was upset but tensions only got worse when Torio came to O'Banion with a request O'Banion I see are casinos doing swimmingly as usual as good as can be expected with those friends of yours constantly causing problems about that I think I know something that might be able to smooth over some of that ill-will between you and the Genesis what cockamamie plan are you trying to cook up now well you remember one of the Jenna Brothers owes this very Casino a large sum of money maybe if you agree to forgive their debt go back off a little forgive their death I've always suspected was toriel when you proved it right here you Italians are all the same working hard to take my money out from under me I'll forgive his debt Over My Dead Body you think it's time to make that happen boss I think it's time with O'Banion refusing to back down Toreo and Capone used his refusal as the excuse they were looking for it to eliminate O'Banion and try to claim his territory once again and Torio and Capone look to their friend Frankie Yale for help Frankie placed an order it O'Banion flower shop in on November 10th 1924 he wanted to pick up the order with John scalisi and Albert anselmi to of the Jenna's top gunman Frankie Yale I've got your bouquet right here you got the cash of course of course but before we make the deal I gotta shake hands with you sir of course congrats on your recent successes thank you very You Can Let Go my hand now now I don't think I can U Jenna Bass at Oreos command Frankie Yale John scalisi and Albert anselmi gun down Dean O'Banion in his flower shop growing colosimo's lead Dean O'Banion funeral was extravagant his coffin cost his family $10,000 and it was piled high with thousands more dollars worth of flowers it seemed to the time that the entire city of Chicago had massed on the streets to mourn his passing politicians policeman gangsters and even Southside Mobsters Toreo and Capone attended the funeral however they had not arrived to pay their respects instead Capone and Torio locked eyes with Hymie Weiss O'Banion second-in-command component Oreo mint their steer as a threat what happened to Dean could easily happen to Weis and they wanted him to know it but Weiss was not cowed by there stairs instead he glared back and spat on the ground the Italians weren't the only people who could shoot a man he wanted torrio and Capone to know he would be coming for them soon had pushed the North and South Side gangs toward all out war after o'banion's death command of the north side forces fell to Hymie Weiss with Vincent schemer drucci as his second-in-command and George Bugs Moran as their primary muscle despite the Southside threats wife swore Vengeance against Oreo and Capone he quickly planned his own assassinations and it didn't take long for him to act on January 12th 1925 Weiss druchii in Moran came across Capone's a limousine parked on the side of the street they roll down the windows of their own vehicle an open fire they tore the car apart with lead wounding Capone's driver however Capone himself had been inside the building making a purchase at the time of the attack after water spill Capone came out of the building to see the devastation they had wrought on his automobile for the first time in his Gangland career Capone realized how easily you could be taken out his fear by placing an order for a new bullet-proof Cadillac the Cadillac would be so heavy that it could hardly drive but it's solid steel door is an inch thick windows made him nearly invulnerable while he was on the streets Capone's new ride was a message to Gangland to not even try attacking him again but while Capone was showing up his own defenses Torio remains vulnerable to Weis in the north side gang January 24th 1925 only days after the attack on Capone's car Weiss druchii and Moran drove up alongside Torio and his wife as they were exiting their car outside of their apartment building Weiss & More an open fire on Torio ultimately hitting him in his jaw abdomen groin legs and lungs Weiss ran up and put the barrel of his gun against Oreos head he pulled the trigger but the gun was out of ammunition without missing a beat why is began kicking Torio in the gut and Moran began beating him with a billy club to help out after a short time beating Torio druchii signal to the others that it was time to go the northsiders lift Oreo bleeding out upon the ground which Oreos wife had already managed to call an ambulance Toreo was rushed to the hospital and after several hours of intensive surgery he miraculously survived in the hospital Capone station two armed men outside his door at all hours of the day when chorizo is finally feeling well enough to talk he had something surprising to tell Capone I'm real happy you're still breathing boss Wiseau pay for this I swear it I've got people telling them as we speak good good I'm glad you got it under control you'll do well when I'm gone sure you're not going anywhere anytime soon thank God see that's what I want to talk to you about we've only got one life then after I almost lost mine I've decided I'd rather keep it I'm done with the outfit Al it make me real happy if you would run it in my stead you're done you're walking away just like that it's all yours out me I'm quitting it's your app for me even though he had survived the attack Toria was effectively eliminated from the bootlegging business he had become so frightened of assassination that he passed the torch on to Capone's and moved to Italy with all his wealth and Tow this was a wise move Ontario's part as a Gangland violence was not about to slow down anytime soon now 27 year old Weiss and 26 year old Capone each had scores to settle against one another the North and South Side gangs both continued their war with each side losing people valuable to their cause by patrons of the north side gang found themselves subject to bombings and drive-by shootings while the Jenna Brothers of the West Side gang found themselves hunted and murdered by Weiss and his Killers Weiss even took another shot at Capone on September 20th 1926 Capone's not eating at the restaurant in the Hawthorne hotel as he was discussing business with his bodyguard Frank Rio he heard gunshots from the street Capone's stood and began walking to the window to see what was going on he noticed a line of eight cars driving down the street towards the hotel just then Frank Rio tackled Capone to the ground dozens of bullets shattered the windows and flew through the restaurant peppering the walls with lead and dust they listened in terror is each car drove past Thompson machine guns blazing they heard one of the cars stop a man got out and kicked in the front door of the restaurant opening fire on the interior Capone lay on the ground while bits and pieces of the wall rain down on him from above praying that the shooter hadn't seen him after what seemed like an eternity the shooter ran out of ammo Capone held his breath and lay as still as he could waiting then he heard the man leave in the last of the eight cars Speedway Capone lay on the ground and stared at the destruction around him once again he had come with an inches of losing his life he knew he had to end this Warfare before it ended him twice and requested that they get together to discuss terms for a peace agreement wise was interested and he agreed to meet on October 4th 1926 Capone and Weiss finally met you in person I'm glad you were able to make it out mr. Weiss I was afraid one of us would have to die to put an end to all this senseless Bloodshed I sympathize with you it would certainly be nice if we could come to an agreement would you like to split profits go into business together I'm open to suggestions just tell me what you want to make this all go away I have plenty of money Capone I haven't been firing on your men for business Norfolk pleasure I'm aiming for justice and if you're willing to give that to me I think we can finally be able to move on Justice for O'Banion I'm not going to let you kill me that would defeat the point of this whole thing I don't want your head I want the triggaman you will give me scalici and on Sony and I'll consider my garage fulfilled no no absolutely not I wanted to meet you to end the violence and your offer is to kill two of my best men instead I thought you were businessman but if that's all you can ask for I don't think we've got anything more to discuss fair enough I suppose the next time I see you will be when we're both in hell you have to save me a seat at a feeling you'll be getting there first the peace talks had fallen through now Capone was convinced that in order to end the war he needed to move as quickly as possible to end Hymie Weiss himself Capone set up Lookouts outside of a banyan's former flower shop what should continue to function as the operating base for the north side gang even after albanians death Capone's men track twice is movement and found boarding rooms with clear firing lines to the street down the street with four of his men they slid their boarding room windows open and begin to fire the street was peppered with bullets and by the end of the machine gun fire I mean Weiss lay upon the concrete dead with Weiss dead Benson schemer drucci and George Bugs Moran took joint control of the north side gang they both wanted revenge for the deaths of their friends but Capone was fed up with emotions interfering with his business network of middleman and Messengers Capone contacted Ruchi in Moran and ask them to attend a piece me at the hotel Sherman druchii was interested but Moran had other ideas Jaime didn't want peace with that man and neither do I we don't stop until we stop components heart you hear me true she look I want him dead as much as you but blood is bad for business besides the cops want to end the violence to and if they get involved we won't have any business to speak of it all I hear you I really do but this isn't just about business this is about Justice Dean and Jaime demanded and I'm not saying we need to make peace with Capone for all time I'm just saying we need to make peace for now lie low take a breather they would be nice not to worry about Hitman while walking down the street for a while I agree we're going to the meeting then yeah yeah let's go in late October shortly after successfully assassinating Hymie Weiss Al Capone managed to convince the north side gang leaders to meet with him and discuss terms for peace as the gangsters met talk focused on their shared threat of federal government Crackdown well the gangsters owns the politicians and police of Chicago their bloody Feud had drawn the attention of the nation at large and some federal politicians had been speaking in the papers about putting Chicago under martial law law we're not likely to be carried out Capone Moran and druchii had all taken notice of them after several days of negotiations the two gangs agreed to call a truce Capone's man would stay in Capone's territory and the northsiders would stay in theirs they would live in different worlds not interfere with each other and live we ever after this agreement came to be known as the hotel Sherman treaty and it would go down in Chicago History as the most effective ceasefire agreement to ever exist during the Chicago Beer Wars in total Chicago gangs went 70 days without attacking each other an impressive feat however no Gangland peace was ever going to last learn about the Rockets end of the ceasefire after this story in October of 1926 Al Capone successfully negotiated a peace with his Northside Rivals Vincent schemer drucci and George Bugs Moran however at these Gangland Good Times soon came to an end when the election for the Chicago mayor came around elections in Chicago violence has competing gangs had competing candidates who would cater to their interests this political violence took many forms including voter intimidation abductions of campaign officials Ballot Box robberies and even murder if the election was contentious enough during campaign season Capone had promoted his candidate for mayor and I've been making several illegal pushes to convince City Alderman to help him keep his mayor in charge however North Side gang had their own mayoral candidate and they saw Capone's meddling as a step too far during peacetime in order to combat Capone in the polls druchii took two of his men to the office of an opposing Alderman and attempted to ransack the place on the day before the election wild Richie was tearing through the office detective Dan Healy caught him interested in as detective Healy LED Russia to the car druchii berated him who do you think you are you freaking wise guy I own this place I own you you think you could just drag me along by the arm like some dame get in the car and shut your mouth shut my mouth shut my mouth you don't tell me to shut my mouth I said shut it or what wise guy or this detective Healy shot Vincent schemer drucci as she sat in the back seat of his police car coochie fell to the floor of the car and quickly bled to death as bullets had penetrated his arm leg and abdomen not at the order of Capone or any other gangster however when Bugs Moran heard about the death of his friend he was incensed druchii had been the one who talked him into peace with Capone and now it's rucci did there was nobody left to temper Moran's rage under Marines leadership the north side gang returned Waging all-out War against Capone and the Southsiders for rent proved himself to be quite violent but not the most intelligent mobster he would make many assassination attempts against Capone and his lieutenants but he would fail much of the time by that same measure Capone would struggle to kill Moran as efficiently as he had eliminated Moran's predecessors the conflict between the two stretch throughout all of 1927 and well into 1928 to make matters worse Capone and had a falling out with his old friend Frankie Yale president of the Yoni CT Indiana the Chicago chapter of the uni uni City Rihanna had recently had its leader murdered and Frankie was pushing for a different replacement than Capone essentially forcing them both of I-4 power within Capone Zone District determined to put his man in office Frankie had begun supporting an up-and-coming Italian gang in the westside of Chicago led by the a yellow brothers in their own efforts to take control the ILO said even gone so far as to partner with Moran and his gang in their actions against Capone Capone tried to mend things over with Yale by inviting him to a prize fighting boxing match in Chicago Yale agreed to attend oh would you look at that punch it's really something I'm glad we get to watch this together out me to Frankie I'd like this to be a regular thing but you understand that we might have issues if you keep working against me don't think of it is working against you think of it is working for me it's just business old friend know Frankie UC business with me and you get me my liquor shipments on time and stop messing with my business that's business agree to disagree now it's finished watching the fight Joey sure sure I'll finish the fight what was that nothing Frankie nothing Frankie return to New York shortly after with both men aware that their formally chummy relationship had turned into a deadly Feud I wanted to get rid of Frankie Yale but he knew that Frankie would recognize any of his typical assassins and see them coming from a mile away in order to pull off a hit Capone turn to some of his more recent hires a pack of thugs he admitted Detroit he called the American boys whose men were Contract Killers and on robbers who had once been a part of the Egan's rats gang in St Louis Missouri included men like Fred killer Burke Gus Winkler Bob Kerrey Raymond kraynak Nugent and Fred gets each of them were violent and ambitious in their own ways and when Capone offered them cold Hard Cash to go to New York and eliminate Frankie Yale they couldn't refuse on July 1st 1928 Frankie Yale was going about his daily routine and one of his clubs when he got a strange phone call this is Frankie Frankie your wife something's wrong with her she needs you now what who is this what do you mean something's wrong with your wife get to her before someone else does I don't appreciate being jerked around so you tell me what's the receiving a strange call about his wife Frankie Yale went to his car to drive home as quickly as possible he didn't know that Capone's American boys were waiting for in the American boys chased him in their own vehicle firing out the window in an attempt to gun him down he drove as quickly as he could but his car simply wasn't fast enough to outrun his pursuers the American boys pulled up beside him and unloaded their weapons into Frankie's vehicle several shots went through his brain and the car lost control hopping the curb and crashing into a nearby building the American boys sped away and abandon their car they had used a Thompson submachine gun and while this gun had been a popular choice of weapon for Chicago gangsters 4 years this was the first time that weapon had been used in New York City and Thompson submachine gun was known to be brutal and effective it was a symbol of violence and Overkill throughout the nation and New York was shocked to see such a weapon used within its own City Limits someone from Chicago based on the choice of weapon alone however they would have no evidence to prove this until months later leaving Capone free to continue his operation with Frankie Yale eliminated Capone's primary remaining competition was Bugs Moran and is north side gang by the fall of 1928 Capone it become fed up with Moran and in either October or November of that year he gathered some of his top men together at one of his men's largest near couderay in Northwest Wisconsin the men present at the meeting included several of Capone's American boys as well as Louis Campagna on a Capone's top gunmen and to corrupt city politicians Daniel serritella and William Bocelli spent two weeks discussing plans to get rid of Moran when they were satisfied with their scheme they went their separate ways each man with his own marching orders going forward while many within Capone's organization had heard that the meeting had taken place none knew the specifics of the plan least of all North Side gang head Bugs Moran and as November and then December came and went with no attempts being made on Moran's life most people within the outfit forgot that the meeting had taken place at all time then passed into January of 1929 in the city of Chicago rang in the new year nobody expected what Horrors the city would witness in February on February 14th 1929 Bugs Moran was heading to a meeting he had arranged with some of his top men they were supposed to arrive by 10:30 that morning at the SMC Cartage company garage and illicit secondary base of operations for the north side gang there is some common misinformation about why Moran had called the meeting sources often say the meeting was called to receive and unload a load of liquor recently hijack from Capone shipments however the evidence does not bear this Theory out as Moran likely would not have brought together his highest ranking men simply to unload barrels of whiskey instead Moran had called the meeting to cook up the plan for his next assassination attempt against Capone this information only became publicly available years after the incident occurred hence why the false theory is the most common explanation for the meeting approached his planning session Bugs Moran was walking through the chilly winter air down North Clark Street only a few blocks away from Lake Michigan as she approached the SMC Cartage garage he noticed something odd a car that look very similar to a police vehicle was approaching the garage from down the street it didn't have any police markings but he could see two men sitting in the front seat Moran had seen Vehicles like these before undercover cops had to use them to read some of the stash houses in Moran felt his hair stand on end is he saw them sitting outside of his important meeting he popped up his collar and pulled his hat down to better obscure his face and he turned around he ducked into a coffee shop along with one of his fellow gang members named Ted Newberry sure that the police were coming to raid his meeting but he wasn't going to take any chances as you stepped out of the cold Chicago are he just hoped his men wouldn't be locked up in prison for too long they had business to a n2y Moran had noticed vehicle he was lucky that certain men hadn't noticed him at the boarding house across the street from the SMC Cartage garage Capone had two men watching from a room on the second floor Jimmy the Swede Moran and Jimmy McKesson were two low-level Capone Thugs who knew Bugs Moran by sight they were staking out the garage along with the young man named Byron Bolton to watch for Moran's arrival but is he walked by they failed to spot him in fact one of bugs Moran's other men that arrived 10 minutes earlier the Lookouts had mistaken that man for bugs himself we don't know exactly who they confused for bugs but as Albert weinshank was a similar height and build to Moran it's likely they had mistaken the two given the distance they made a call to their men waiting in the nearby Home of a fellow Southside hoodlum yellow the rabbit is in the hole repeat the rabbit is in the hole sending the hounds capiche capiche Capone's men wear on their way does Capone's men drove to the garage Marans men were waiting inside they were some of Moran's highest-ranking gang members such as Albert cashier black Marans right hand man Adam higher Moran's bookkeeper Albert weinshank one of Moran's business managers and Frank and Peter Gusenberg his two best gunman two other people were also present at the meeting one was Reinhardt Schwimmer an optician who would quit doctoring in order to hang out and gamble with gang members he had not been involved in any illegal gang activity he simply enjoyed keeping the company of thugs vehicles for the north side gang from time to time he happened to be working at the garage at the time and had not intended to be present for a high-tier meeting as far as we are aware it even brought along his
