that's where we post our calls for Cosmic queries follow StarTalk radio so you don't miss a thingfrom the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and beaming out of space and time we're science and pop culture collab this is StarTalk welcome back I'm your host Neil deGrasse Tyson your personal astrophysicist and we are coming to you from my office at the Hayden planetarium in the American Museum of Natural History right here in New York City and Today Show is all about curiosity curiosity what does that even mean it's all we carry are we still curious as a species curious as individuals and it will feature my interview with the one and the only Larry King very curious if you'd like a hundred billion people interviewed most I got with me is mykos Chuck Nice Jack will be back I'll be tweeting at Chuck nice, very nice I follow you and I know things are people so just letting you know I feel somehow I'm devalued brain here cuz curiosity is a human State of Mind underscore Berlin you let me tell people that have a underscore underscore underscore Berlin and so we're looking you up right now Heather I hate underscore welcome back to start to a regular now is always good to have you so Larry King I bumped into him in Norway of all places wow and it said I got a life you lived here by summer in Norway he's been a talk show hosts 1978 S40 Volvo jokes longer he was like in the inner ear is Larry King now and politicking with Larry King so what do you think is has made him so popular with people but also just removing himself from the picture I think any good interview where it's about eliciting information from people asking the right questions so if he didn't do that you don't think you have the longevity that he did he just look at you I was about to say but his Rises Up Above the Rest now I can't say that in about an hour and you're really a genuinely interested in understanding the human being that you're they're interviewing and and also asking questions that haven't been asking being creative and the kinds of questions you ask to elicit new and novel information from these people you know you've been interviewed you've been you know Western Ave you want to show me your truck but one of the other what does it take to make a good talk show host I'll Always Love my ego at the door I didn't use the word I and interviews I asked short questions I didn't read the great books so my curiosity delved into people in the way they act in a way they move today that's why I can't watch him if you want to talk if you watch few TuneIn good television talk show a good television talk show 9 out of 10 times you should see the guest video that should be talkin to you my truism in life is I never learned anything when I was talk I never learned anything so I can tell stories I can make people laugh but I never learned I only learned something when I asked a question and someone was talking to me that's a feature of the wisest people we have ever met or no they spend less time talking and more time listening there it is now I'm scared to tell her I know me to read books he doesn't really prepare he's just the start of open that's not a lot of preparation if you're not like say reading a person's book before you interview them for example the great books which I interpreted as the great books now you have to show off that you know what's in the grave by Shakespeare said and then all the sudden you're bringing a home cancel baggage intellectual baggage into a conversation restrictive but it forces you to be a bigger part of conversation then you should be cuz you have too much you could write let's bring some more expertise hear some expertise about journalism basically and pop culture and television and end the like so I got Robert Thompson I bet you on Skype or do you there I am a trustee professor of television and pop culture at Syracuse University is that the orange Folks up there welcome to StarTalk the Briar Center for television pop culture of televisions second golden age from Hill Street Blues to ER that mean we're in the third golden age because this is the best television that's ever make sure I got to agree yeah like 96 and I think we're still in that the second but maybe we'll call the third starting with about The Sopranos so you have a very long Baseline of analysis of things that operate in pop culture what is your perspective on Larry King's longevity in this I think Mary has a couple of things up his sleeve that people really liked and some of it was and you guys were plugging a little bit about this forget not reading the great books he didn't read the books that he was talking about on the are on the way to the station who he was interviewing that night unless it happened to be the price of a prime minister or someone important he was quite proud I think is quite proud of the fact that he doesn't do a lot of preparation interview Jerry Seinfeld Jerry Seinfeld's just come off this of course spectacular least successful show it ends at number 1 and Larry says so I remember I said yes I'll hit you going Jerry Jerry really is kind of me and you that you almost want to give Larry a hug after this because Jerry says start saying things like a DUI don't you realize we had 75 million viewers and he will not let up and almost cried Uncle not quite but he's close to him in the ass this one time all right but the rest of it apparently it's a successful formula apparent lack of preparation is it is very much a part of the element that I think there is a sense that he comes in and he talks about the back how he is interested in people he certainly has a high level of curiosity and I think he wanders in there and kind of goes on to that set and he doesn't ask a lot of Hardball questions he doesn't seem to be incredibly prepared but he kind of seems like somebody would ask if you ran into them and you were waiting for waiting for a bus and I think for a lot of people that is really appealing are playing you didn't do your homework exactly now don't get me wrong I do not recommend people that do interviews take pride in the fact that they're unprepared to do them but Larry King I think is managed to make an art with this and then there's the second thing that I think is at the key to his magic and that is he has been around forever he is talked to so many people and every interview that he does is somewhere humming in the background a few with all the other interview to see how he's done I will give you a challenge and the dude has a drinking game and take a shot every time he says when I was talking to Anthony Quinn or Derek Jeter wants told me or Lenny Bruce by good for you will be hammered by the end of the first break and you will be out by the end of the show okay so he's actually talk to these people he's got a sense that Larry King is this human database he's talk to all these people so he's got a comment from an interesting person and a famous person to make any single thing that ever comes up in a conversation so he is his own landscape of knowledge on which he conducts his next interview so he can draw from all of the vegetation that is grown on the landscape that he told him that he's been in business yes you no means of obtaining information about a delivering information how people consume information and so I just wanted to get his thoughts and is Reflections on the state of technology in his business let's check it out how has your life been touched by technology but at this for 60 years I can't do the math on that I don't think should I push against it I started in radio when we had landlines and phone lines and then came satellites and Ted Turner and the world expanded and now there's the internet but I'm doing exactly what I did 61 years ago asking questions but I'm transmitted differently I was transmitted by phone lines I was with you I was I did the satellite show on television Ted Turner saw this in which Legend Q2 said this to Franklin or Jefferson or I sat in the studio interviewing you weed together would be beamed up 23800 my hit a machine that's traveling with a beamed up and went down and reach someone in Moscow or across the street same way from not being how to help you do that now that amazes me if you gave me the scientific explanation I will be lost in equals MC square but a very fun fact that I can go up is so amazing to me that I don't need an explanation of how it works but I would love to talk to the guy who invented satellites and what was he thinking did he sit down once I can hit a moving object and transmit you ten thousand miles away what made him think that that's what fascinates me so those who I love technology I love what I can do but I am I always attempt to push back at it there he is just the thing I don't care about it all but I love to death I'd forgotten him as having been a TV since 1978 but it going to rain in Robert how has has I was there when Alexander Graham Bell said Watson come here I showed up instead that was my first radio broadcast my first show was calling people so Robert has the fact that our capacity to communicate with one another be having become more prevalent easier Moore mobile has that increase or decrease the percentage of talk shows that are out there as it improve them as it made the easy so anybody can have a talk show what's the status of it today relative to them well first of all yes it's increase the number they be real estate we're waiting put this stuff now is almost instant there used to be in OSU national television networks and it was radio and that was it so there's lots more opportunities it is true if I went down to my class tomorrow and I asked how many people in the class had a podcast my guess is that at least half of them and most of them interview because that's a natural thing to do was amusing enough but when I compare the kind of interview the Johnny Carson used to do with the kind of thing that the Jon Stewart Colbert even though that was suppose well so I think a lot of it is way way better the other thing is we get to hear talk shows and conversations about things other than what Johnny Carson and Merv Griffin and Mike Douglas wanted to talk about and let's face it that was a pretty narrow set of definition so overall more voices more subjects lower budgets in many cases from 03 classic names there's also Dick Cavett right that was a little more thoughtful as going to be a big head so there were others that mean it wasn't like ours was the only one in town but there weren't a lot and I think there's still what Larry King is done is he's kind of straddle as he very much points out I love that old the satellite because he started the Ode To The Satellites with the Ode to the landline I mean that that guy is a real when you think about it Larry King has done the interview format in every other electronic medium except the Telegraph and now he's doing it as well and you needed to buy Morse code right I started off with a tin can on a string and he talks loud enough that would have probably going to be more much more variety much more diversity and that's one of the reasons why to younger people Larry King does seem like such an anachronism he still rises up in the den of talk show host are out there like you said that number is semi infinite if not actually infinite of number of people who have talk shows podcast we call them today so yet he still rises up even in a generation that are very few people his age can resonate with people who are very unwise I guess Bernie Sanders does but these people are far and few between so somehow he still resonates well I don't know I'm not sure how much Larry King is resonating with you know what let's say my students at the age of 18 to 24 probably heard of him I have a very strong doubt that many of them have seen an interview that he's done I think Larry King continues to resonate across the board because he is and I hate to throw this word around we use it way too much but he is an icon he is one of those but he's been on Saturday Night Live any decent comedian can pull a Larry King out of their bag of tricks a joke about how old he is a of work above the people who do Larry King stood up so that's why I think he continues to resume how many young people are watching comrade King on his Russia Today broadcast we're going out to Hulu Hulu to see politicking or what's it called my Larry King now I have a feeling not a whole lot a whole lot of work that it had such influence over the years that you elevate and you become an icon to become a fundamental part of Pop Culture I was honored to be in the presence of three such accomplished performance artist free space and science down to earth George listening to Star Talk we're back on Star talk to check nice my co-host and Heather Berlin a friend of StarTalk StarTalk plus or minus Israelis have brain issues and you're you are our go-to brain person to remind me you are a professor of neuroscience at Mount Sinai Psychiatry scientist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Carlisle Borough I can change the name a place where featuring my interview the one and only Larry King and we connected up in Norway I was I was at a conference we both had a conference and so once you get an understanding of his perspective on his own success and so let's check that out how come in daily life I have been so stupid I mean stupid I did not handle money well I'm falling you like a psychologist I've been married many times I didn't handle relationships well but when that light went on when I went into that studio I asked the psychologist wants to explain that to me cuz I'm supposed to be wise but I do stupid things why do smart people do Sue and he said because when that light goes on you have control who doesn't like control so I was doing an hour television show every night and a 5-hour Radio Shack show that's 6 hours 8 hours sleep so this 10 hours a day I didn't control I wasn't good at it but those six hours I control and I never thought of it as controlling but the host of any of your show is the control of that show you are the control of the even if I'm talkin now you're in control you cut me off you could stop and go to difference if you're in control what a joy that is what a life that is be in control of something most people in adulthood control nothing is a boss there's an organization they're beholden to so many other forces so yeah that's an excellent point that you're in control of my environment for that. Of time true except when the producer tell you to shut up cuz I got to put in a commercial even then I could say oh wait a minute you still is still in control you really are so Heather I mean he comes to this Revelation which sounds very eye-opening experience for him that he came to this Revelation through the efforts of a psychologist is this is this a common need that people have they think they need to be in control but everybody has issues already see her once a week okay and which is hard because you have to give up the way you think things should be give up control and so the ideal circumstances if you're in a situation where everything goes exactly the way you want it to go there is no compromise so there's no friction and part of working out relationships is learning how to give up how to concede things for the other person having some of it is ironic that because you're part of what he does how to reach in and understand other people yet when it comes to his own life he's not very good perhaps at maybe conceding to other people in his life and having a bit of empathy in that respect you should have just had his wife on his show and just like when he got done is show just come home and just be like interview with wife so he would like to join the entire day you know just pretend he's in control and anyone he has to compromise with would not be and that would be a recipe for disaster it sounds. This phenomenon where everyone is sort of bowing down to them like you know one of their needs is met and then they go offset and it's like hey you know why isn't this happening at home and they're sort of had that level expectations. Whether it's conscious or not I can also be to depression and then I went back to my normal life Serta to go back to and it was like okay that's not a purpose even though people weren't you know bearing down for me every minute but TV show is abused or drop that is there is all of that. But now they can lead to depression anymore nobody cares about me all the people and all the institutions and all the cultural cultural forces cultural elements that lead people to just obey other people there many people wear control is not their goal their happiest following rules established by other three different personality types so some people really want to be in control others want to be told what to do they want to conceive control so even with learning me see that like some people were very good and learning environments words for a structured because they want to be told what to do and have set exam where's others are more comfortable in situations where they can learn at their own pace where they can serve set their own schedule one of these were the other and one the other fails the other if you would do if you're in the wrong place Larry also as an understanding of his success he credits his insatiable curiosity is a scientist and is an educator my ears perk up even more because curiosity is the center of anything we do as a sin science and so I had to get to the bottom of that just check it out you want to know how somebody text so I think of you and your line of questioning and you're perceptive ways that you reach people and have them become comfortable in your present I think of that as what any good psychologist should do you know I've been that way all my life I remember being set 8 years old getting on a bus and asking the bus driver why do you want to drive a bus and all my life I've asked what to me is the simplest of questions I'm ever asking a pilot when you're going down the runway do you know it's going to take off those are things I think about I don't have to know about propeller or division of the those are things the wise why do you care about this I interviewed want to wipe who was the first cardiologist there was no Specialties until he was the term he went to medical school but it was on special D in cardiology he was Eisenhower's physician and I asked him if you shot in medical school today what specialty would you choose and he said neurology. And I said why and he said because of what we know about the hot now which we know so much I know this much about the brain but that's from asking from the Curiosity to comes is what what boggles your mind what what makes you tick what do you like I've asked you in the past why do you look at the sky what are you wondering about why do people lose their curiosity cuz I assume we're all curious as children that's very natural thing that scientists never really grow up so they're still their adult children in their curiosity but I think many people just lose curiosity sometimes it's rejuvenating that's possible I've seen it but fan the flame and reignites and did their eyes brighten but for many it's not the case was there some Neuroscience study of this yet but it's actually only recently has there been Neuroscience studies looking at what's happening the brain when people are curious so they'll give people for example of a riddle or a quiz quiz kind of question to solve and then they wait and they look at just was having a brave on the person's curious to hear the answer and then they give them the answer what they find is that Curiosity stimulates this the wanting system of the brain that nucleus accumbens which is that to the dopaminergic system in the brain that drives us it's the same kind of drive as we have to be so it starts ejaculation me directions to draw yes yes it's the same wanting feeling you get with drugs of addiction when you're hungry and you're seeking answer your piece of me instead of food being the reward knowledge information is the reward that you're getting I was really interesting as you see the sort of upside down U-shaped curve in terms of satiation of curiosity so if you know nothing about nothing you're not going to be that curious you know a little bit and you want to know more you're going to increase your curiosity until we get to sort of the highest point in the more you know actually more information you start to accumulate curiosity goes down and the Brain activation related to that one thing and that drive goes down because you've gotten enough information so it's just like when your husband makes sense if you evolutionarily speaking to seek out information to explore things that you don't understand she told me I am high in search of cosmic truths the Red Hot Chili Peppers have a song californiacation and there's a light so on but it it was so natural human Drive the reason children seem to be more Curious is we also have another part of her brain that kind of restricts these desires is Basic Instincts that we have four doors we need another part of the brain cremation sky was just too curious and fall off the cliff of those basic desire stress eating one of them one might be food one might be to drive for sex or drugs whatever those drives are we have something that limits them as we age that needs to symptoms to not wanting dopamine system and that kind of controlling system the prefrontal cortex which isn't developed until around in your mid-20s so adults are more restrictive and they sense adults can become more curious if they just kind of turned on activation of that prefrontal cortex and we can get them to do that and I'm the more we let go of control the more we can kind of engage that Curiosity which is an interesting on conundrum with our King because he's both curious yet likes to control what are king cobras a simple question but I want to call it that let me call it a a naive question and a naive question you make no assumptions about anyting cuz you don't know anything so you ask a basic question that would be overlooked by anyone who knew even a little bit more than you did and yet sometimes that's the very question that gets the heart of the matter absolutely restricted we are in many ways and our thinking are we learned what what's what's not what's a normal question. What would be your trying putting a lot of effort what's a smart question and then you're losing some of these very basic simple things of kids ask the best questions you know cuz they haven't been sort of filtered yet and so it one way that we can get around that is to release the filters force will try not to take in too much information so that you become sort of Tainted and wet War II just like let-go and away let yourself be in that flow State we're in the moment and anything goes and then you can access those those unkind I did so I prefer to because I want to restrict what I know at a fear that I won't be as curious I just go into like let the information be whatever it is bloatware I float next and you also let your ears only fly out of his mouth another thing that motivate maybe this works I don't know if this is what happens with you and you're interviewing people but we tend to let our curiosity guide us and so you you get excited about a particular question that guys were going to go or some information you're curious about and that's that dopamine system at work and so I think really good interviewers are using that to navigate their questions rather than some piece of paper that has all the questions write down exactly do you want to be organic and the path that you takes through the information otherwise you're not tapping the richest parts of what can be contributed to an extended back more of my interview who is Larry King protein is such an important part of a healthy lifestyle whether you're trying to build muscle which I am or lose weight which I am or just get your nutrition on track which I am and that's what you are going to love game.

And he'll tell me how if I put this gas Baptist pehlivan it will go into that place and we mix it together the blue and the yellow will come out green I don't care I don't have curiosity I have curiosity about space and I was exist but the thing is you explain about oval and circular microcosms and things that I'm more interested in the whys of people why do people do what they do you know it's a truism no evil person thinks they're evil power interviewing Osama bin Laden who murdered a lot of people that day in September I wouldn't ask him about murdering people immediately but I would ask him why why did you one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia why'd you go live in Afghanistan why do you live in a cave that to me is the wives of life not as you would understand the distance or parameter that is goes from Saudi Arabia for Afghanistan in mileage from orbit is that I wouldn't think about that the difference is you are curious about people very what makes them tick motivates their actions what inspires them to do and be what they become I'm curious about you use it as a black kid growing up in the Bronx astrophysics, it's not in your how you devised the formula if I'm interviewing Einstein I don't care how much so much about equals MC square which I still don't know what that means I would interested in how Einstein got interested in that and why that matters to him and to me black kid growing up in the Bronx into the Blackness of the night sky and think I see myself so Heather oversimplify something just to get into the conversation there people who are immensely curious about other people if they took that to an academic level they become psychologist or Anthropologist in a cultural Anthropologist I am very curious but less so about other people and more about how the universe works so I become a physical scientists where my topics are not people but the ones are nature only in humans what other animals as well here's my question there are people out there who are just curious about other people and they would read The National Enquirer or Page 6 in the poster what is driving the interest in other people that is not of an academic nature more of a nosy curious voyeuristic nature what's going what's this why are we fascinated by famous people at all evolutionary explanation for this right I'm Frizzle famous people are taking the place of what was in in the local tribe is the alpha male or Define this is an important person I should know they have power status they can if I'm friends with them. Could help me have an advance and try it so that's innate that's its way or protection so that's part of what's driving us for these interests were social creatures so again we care about knowing more about these high status people because is that a person I can trust are they someone that I can attend broken there because when they're in the tribe They're bringing back through the food they said they they wrestle the saber-tooth tiger is a big strong man they come back and that should share with the tribe is much smaller than that today today the tribe is a million people in your city you are still interested in that person even though they're not actually putting food on your plate means I'm not about the weekend off so it's all right cuz because they look into a cavity look into your eyes and so he's going to like that when I was a kid I thought I knew the people on TV but then I grew up right at the interest in their lives is still there so that part is hard to but I think the circuitry of of of curiosity is in all of us and what it what it is sort of ism manifest is different right so you are just an in space but it's all that same mechanism and I think everybody has that in them that drives them a chance to find the right Outlet what are some people just really interested in the lives of other people I think it's an evolutionary advantage to have that so people who are in front of the cave Professor who's not very social because their interests lie and trying to figure out like the universe that's what they're busy caring bath not about like who is Mary dating so my next question to Larry King is kind of obvious when you think about it itch who's the guest that you never got that see what I'm definitely want to have and what would you ask that the only time I went there criteria for Texas ready to swallow whatever happens next go for it you could interview God what would you what would you ask how is that said today at a forum I didn't went on one of my former okay and they said who would you like to interview that you have an interview I said what I always wanted to do Castro but he I went to Havana we didn't get them and and that hurt me but I've interviewed like eight nine presidents and world leaders in Brando and Sinatra but if I could interview God God my first question do you have a kid now he says no okay I throw half of the major religions of the world in the chaos didn't have a kid the Vatican closes what would you ask God suppose he says yes who was he and what was his name was he Jewish, was it a girl was it a boy by Donna so he should have got that interview with God right at the at the beginning of creation yeah I just have a kid is he Jewish that's hilarious I'm not going to go that far is the professional stand up comedian in a good since you exist in this world this world was alive I'd like to talk to Alabama for a bit there so many people I want to talk to you but but yeah I think I think he'd be so I'm going to go back to the scar tissue because I would love to talk to God I want to know first of all why were you why are we here what are we supposed to be doing and what happens when we die that's the fundamental burning question I'd really like the answer I don't care about all these religions whatever whatever just tell me what happens when I die and what I'm supposed to be doing here to talk to living today it's how I would like to talk to them and that would be under the influence of sodium pentathol or some type of truth serum it's really not like the crystal who gladimir Putin let me tell you what he's up to no good fatty foods that is up to no good dad I'm going to go with Jesus oh yeah I would love to actually sit down and talk to Jesus and I'ma put them on the spot and put them right on this just so you know I'm lying okay now I don't want any of these Parables and I don't I want a yes or no question are you the son of the Living God and did he really Son of God Son of God and didn't is there a god at the end of the universe and then it's like I want a yes or no and if it's know you got some splainin to do I mean all those other people that's his plan for me living it would be present Obama had dinner with him so I talked to him the whole time five of the people in the room 6 or 7 paper for the larger or whatever it is that that tap tenets of quantum physics so I just want I want to just have a one-on-one to get them on StarTalk and do that it would Free Press next to Jimmy Carter and are the chances are high you can get a baby just cuz he's seen a lot the night I had dinner with him was the evening of the the terrorist attack in Paris where someone shot up the arena and so he's he's you know where they're having cocktails you use me I got to get a call and then he picks up exactly where we were but he said that was the French President we said we would support but it was like this this this this man is badass but I did I said how are you thinking dude cuz we need some of that you can solve some problems you and your dad we need we need some of that brain matter now if I could interview God okay let's assume I'm dead at this point and I encounter him just shows up then I don't have to do is Manifest right but it's like after I'm dead it's too late for me right so that would be the time that be an interesting moment I would ask before you send me to hell for not entirely embracing Your Existence please answer for me why did you create a universe a universe that was so devoid of your existence why is there so much evidence for your absence rather than evidence for your existence and as someone who studies the universe and asteroid impacts and Extinction episodes and it says like if you dare you ain't benevolent or you ain't all-powerful but you ain't both be my question and then send me to hell maybe you say you know that's an excellent question and I'm going to take the next to Eternity to tell you about it and then you got them then you're the only guy that got out of hell he's going to say sit down in Minecraft my cloud what's the name of this song okay I thought I was bad tether you ain't coming back on that one all right this has been star talk with a delightful interview with the one and only Larry King I want to thank Heather Berlin Heather as always we love to have you and this won't be the last in Czech
