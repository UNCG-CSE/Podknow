I was joining them a movement as opposed to Leading a movement I thought I felt like I was doing what journalists and academics have always tried to do which is to give us the means to look at Familia problems in a new way to think of yourself as being that someone has started something I think that's a little otter say that okay well leonero that we're in now of the genre of books but this is particularly interesting talking to strangers how did you come to decide that this was going to be the next book you we literally are waiting for when the next book is coming out it's been an hour almost 6 years how did you decide that this would be it and talking to strangers was the rock you wanted to uncover we had that wave of police shooting cases brutality cases beginning with Michael Brown in 2014 and I was really shaken up by them and then I began to read about that problem and realize even going on forever which I suppose is very naive but me not to realize that that it was on a scale I've never imagined a thousand civilians are killed every year by police in his country with my white friends are saying oh no no no it's been going on forever now we just have the cameras to show you yes that the kind of ways in which we were trying to make sense of these events seem to me to be inadequate and I also but I don't what I really dislike about those kinds of cases is where we have a big fuss and there's all kinds of people jumping up and down and Amanda it's him he just didn't notice he's racist you know he's doing he's a bad cop these people person I think you know what if it happens it happens maybe there's something deeper going on here and I'm older than racism well in addition to you can't separate race from these police shooting cases it is inextricably part of the reason why they happen but you also can say that this is just about a racist cop because it's more than that it's there's something deeper going on with the way in which we have structured relationships between not just between police officers and civilians but also between strangers of all kinds and that's really why we're I got to buy book as I can we take a step back and say wait a minute is there something fundamentally wrong with the way we are making sense of people who are different from ourselves are we bringing the wrong strategies to that problem and is there a way for me to kind of shed a light on those kinds of strategies in a way that helps us not just makes sense of things like Sandra Bland on Michael Brown or you know what a great case print it off I mean all of these cases struck me as being versions of the same problem which is there two people are trying to have a conversation and they can't figure each other out and I can't figure out each other out because you're done making errors so the question is what are those tears you write on page 14 if we were more thoughtful as a society if we were willing to engage in some soul-searching about how we approach and makes sense of strangers Sandra blind would not have ended up dead in a Texas jail cell so she's a central figure in this book tell me why so she's the beginning in the end of the guess she's a frame for the whole book obviously I have thousands of cases I could have picked to be the frame for it but there was something about just how stupid and senseless and heartbreaking her case was here's a woman who is 28 years old who is coming to get us to start her Life Anew in Prairie View Texas in the middle of rural Texas and we must say this happened as you just mentioned after Michael Brown after Freddie gray Orlando Castile Walter Scott one person but she's she's really should have had some difficulties in Chicago she's moving she's starting her life over she's already arrived in in Prairie View Texas that day she gets has a job interview she gets this job she's leaving the campus to buy groceries and a police officer looks at her and makes a judgement and his judgment is I think there's something funny about her any Trump's up an excuse to pull her over and what what is what is so heartbreaking about that cases you remember is we have the dash cam chords the conversation that ensued between y'all hear the entire conversation conversation and it goes on for pages okay and why are you here and we think it's fine until he asked her to put out the cigarette and she says correctly why do I have to put up my cigarette by the way she hasn't done anything right he pulls up on this is a weird but important detail he pulls in behind her she turns right out of the campus and she's going along the road to the campus and he thinks or something funny about her so he pulls out and he drives up really fast behind her so what does she do she moves over to get out of the way of course which is what you do when a cop is driving without you do the thing that we're Tolbert supposed to do pull over to the side she doesn't use a turning signal cuz she's getting out of the way right now so what is he doing pulls over this is man you didn't turn you didn't use your turning signal it's a completely and she said did I do I mean I didn't use my turning signal because I was getting out of the way it's act like yes and so she's irritated as she should be and so he is about to tell her man you should have used your your turning signal to cigarette he says could you put that out and she says correctly know why do I have to put out a cigarette and then and they have this argument that escalates and he ends up hitting her dragging her out of the car handcuffing her where she commits suicide two days later I can't even tell you how many times it upsets me more each time I hear it and the question is how is it something that trivial can go so badly awry in the in broad daylight in what are the most civilized countries in the world and you say so correctly we see that story we see philando Castile we see Michael Brown we see all those stories and people just move on and you won't talking to strangers because you wanted us to stop and not move on I don't want people to ever forget who Sandra bland is away and forgetting about them without drawing some kind of conclusions about why they happened so how do we begin to actually shift from the Judgment of others and then start looking at ourselves and asking the question what role do I play in this is that your attempt to try to get him to do that so what I wanted to do with the book is to systematically break down the faulty assumptions that lead encounters between strangers to go awry so I meet you for the first time all we know about each other is what we can see about each other we start to have a conversation yeah sometimes it goes well sometimes it goes horribly wrong but we're making judgments all the time based on our own unconscious biases and conscious I'll give you one of the ones that I spend a lot of time is it was what I called the Assumption of transparency which is when I see you I observe your demeanor your face expressions your emotions body language draw conclusions about that a my assumption is that the way you represent your emotions on your face and with your body language is reflective is consistent with the way you feel in your heart if you smile at me it means you're happy if you frown at me it means you're not happy right that is true with some people some of the time but it is not true of many people a lot of the time now I think it's so interesting because you use in the book you call it I think the friends fallacy because we've all grown up watching the sitcoms and we see in the characters the the match between whatever's going on looks like whatever their face is also representing to watch Friends reminded about how insanely complex those shows were like so much happens to my first thing was if you turn off the sound on an episode of Friends can you follow what's going on in the answer is absolutely absolutely is on everyone's face when Monica is angry she looks angry when Ross has perplexed he looks perplexed and all the way down the line and that's our Assumption of the way the world works we assume that our emotions are reliably being broadcast to the world at all Expressions analyze a segment of a Friends episode for me and break it down and it is absolutely the case she using the is a kind of way which emotions of the face can be registered and kind of it is in a specific subset of a scene where Ross is really angry what's on his face and the answer is the perfect illustration of anger and it was specific scene where Monica has mixed emotions she is both upset at at her brother also but also would also like wants to express her love her by the emotions. Why because they're actors in the real world when I was reading this I'm going to say Malachi was thinking the friends actors are going to be so happy to hear this because you were saying perfect execution of the emotion rights of it but in the real world that doesn't it doesn't work that way may I say that so many times that is so true so true cuz in the real world it doesn't match don't go anywhere more to come after this short break today's episode is supported by White Castle America's first fast food hamburger chain as well as the slider experts made with 100% beef patties on their unique signature buns that same one-of-a-kind taste that White Castle has been serving in the restaurants for years is now available at your local grocery store so whether you're a vegetarian or a meat eater White Castle sliders come in a bunch of tasty varieties that anyone in the family can have it on if you're feeling a little cheesy just try their cheese sliders or if you enjoy a little Spice in your life have a taste of their jalapeno cheese sliders one bite and you'll understand but all the Crave is about from the castle or the grocery store you can satisfy your craving any time with White Castle go to whitecastle.com super-soul to get $1 off the purchase of any four or six pack White Castle sliders Amanda Knox case in a nutshell her inner emotions don't match the way she behaves she behaved like someone who didn't care what happened to her dad roommate inside she cared but she just as someone who those inner feelings and our outward expression of emotion don't match and it started the moment she was with other friends of the roommate who was murdered and she didn't have the same reaction they did so they then become suspicious of why isn't she was like us why didn't you why was her hug so stiff a technical word for what she has is mismatched her in her feelings don't matter outward emotions when will deal with someone who is Miss Matched those are very real risk we will get them very badly wrong to Bernie Madoff is mismatched he's in the opposite way. Will this presence in it and Elie Wiesel such a dear friend of mine in Elie Wiesel was in but I would have thought that this person is involved in this person to invest in this person to invest it must be a great guy you can have all of these outstanding people who also care about their you know finances invested with him if he if they hadn't checked him out that's what I probably would have thought but inside is a psychopath outside he seems like the most trustworthy kind of man of integrity veg now going to become a cultural phrase and everybody is going to be talking about the truth default defaulting to the truth the reason why everyone except did Bernie Madoff is because the default to the truth he had this is a really interesting idea from a psychologist call Tim Devine who I think is an absolute brilliantly we thought some of the most Central issues about how human beings communicate and his core inside is dealing with the fact that human beings are really bad yeah we're just all the stomach bloating judges judges are bad at cops about it was a few tiny exceptions but generally will not go to good you think would be good but I wouldn't Evolution have favored those who are good at detecting deception and he says no the opposite is true that we are conditioned by Evolution to basically assume that everyone is telling the truth unless there is some overwhelming reason to believe otherwise and elastin doubts rise so high that there's just no way to believe someone is telling us the truth anymore with people right where they live you were saying and everybody can relate to this if you believe your spouse is cheating on you and you ask a question are you cheating on me or what this doesn't make sense or that doesn't make sense and they give a reasonable answer most people will believe it the first time you will default the truth are preferred position is to believe that the world is telling us the truth and that's why Human Society works if I if every statement you make I think I don't know she lying we couldn't have a conversation does that then the world doesn't work and that's Timber Pines point is that the reason Human Society functions is because we have a based on assumption that people are not lying to us and what that means is every night at one time out of a hundred when someone really is lying to us there's a strong chance we're going to get take it we're going to get to see if he had let's talk about Sandusky and the people who end up having to serve time because they defaulted to the truth for too long let's talk about yeah so we all remember the horrible case of Penn State of Jerry Sandusky this serial child molester who was a prominent football coach at the school he was apprehended he was convicted he's now in jail for the rest of his life but the Penn State the prosecution didn't stop there they then went and went after senior officials at the University in the University's president case is still ongoing but if pursued a criminal case against those senior administrators as well for a cover up for basically of not letting this man Run free on the Penn State campus I feel very strongly that it is wrong to pursue a criminal case against those University administrators what they were they were deceived by a child molester by the way, that's just one of the things that makes them child molesters is there really good at deceiving the rest of the world that's what I've been trying to tell people just cuz if you're not good at it then you can succeed and seducing the child yeah it's like putting do we do be put the people who deceived by Bernie Madoff into jail did we say you should have batter you you work now we didn't I really think that attitude is deeply deeply problematic why we cannot look back in retrospect and and blame someone for the failure to pick out a one-in-a-million psychopath what are the big themes of this book it is does a strong it to the Sandra Bland case is that we need to be far more generous in our assessment of other people yes we are just so quick to assume that something there was a cover-up someone was negligent someone and not an itch I think it's important for us to pause and to understand when when sometimes when mistakes are made it is because of perfectly understandable of a gentleman reasons why you keep kicking the Rock and uncovering so many interesting things and talking to strangers one of the things that struck me was the Stanford rape case we talked about that I'm quite sure this is going to be the most talked-about part of the book and it was really hard to write about so that was the case where happened a couple years ago a freshman at Stanford a boy meets a woman at a frat party they're both very very drunk and he takes her outside and he sexually Seltzer and he's discovered and he's tried and he spent six months in jail used a controversial case of the time particularly because it comes is a kind of the one of those signature cases that has thrown a spotlight on just how much how big a problem sexual assault now he's on campus and I was interested in one specific part of that case which is to what extent does alcohol contribute to this epidemic of sexual assault right because the weird thing is that when you start digging through the Case Files of sexual assault cases everyone's always drunk really really hard to find a sexual assault case where both parties were sober living on campus on campus sexual assault on campus of people who study alcohol in it and they were like oh yes it's almost always alcohol is almost always involved and they talked me through the research well when you drink and by the way the way that many of the people who are in involved in these cases and also I went to a more generally the core of people who are drinking on campus in today's environment are drinking in a way that you and I did not drink in an adage drinking has changed quite dramatically over the last 2 minutes when I was just reading about everybody's drinking everything today if you talked I was talking to some friends of mine children friends of mine who are in college right now and I said how many of your friends have experienced blackouts and they just like they're going to get blackout drunk it's a very different environment and that has consequences for their ability to talk to strangers parties are about talking to strangers when strangers are drunk it's a different conversation since this was something that was so revealing to me many of those who study alcohol no longer consider it an agent I'm disinhibition I mean I underline that because all of our lives have been told it's disinhibition instead you say they think of it as an agent of myopia tell us what you mean by that the old theory about alcohol was Malcolm gets drunk and as Malcolm gets a little tipsy what you see is the real Malcolm constraint uptight Malcolm Falls away and you're seeing like them I using my true self we no longer believe that that's nonsense instead what's happening is a little more complicated when you drink what's happening is your BAC to get Dumber your cognitive faculties start to kind of shrink and what happens when that when your cognitive faculties shrink when you get Dumber is that you get myopic everything that is meaning you just focused on what's in front of you all that matters is you right at this very moment so we're only I don't do certain kinds of crazy things because I really so don't be consequences half an hour later I'll get in trouble or tomorrow I'll wake up and I'll be like oh my God that was that's why I behave the way you behave when I'm sober when I'm drunk all thought of Tomorrow Falls away all thought of consequences Falls away and what matters is just here and now person in front of me I am myopic yeah when you are myopic you are not yourself right either another great example that you use Malcolm was that the drinking affect you differently depending on where you are that if you're drinking and you're at a football game and everybody else is drinking then it is euphoric and blah blah blah and if you are sitting alone at a bar and you're drinking alone that the alcohol has a completely different effect yes Theory says that whatever is your immediate circumstance is controlling the way you think and feel and behave so if I'm drunk and wild and crazy party I'm wild and crazy I'm drunk in a dark quiet desert bar I'm depressed so you're at the mercy of your environment now think about this and Tristan to take an 18 year old girls you take me to a frat party you get them to two and a half times the legal limit of alcohol so he's completely myopic can you crank up the music you have all kinds of Mayhem around him personally the laundry in self and secondly he is primed to do something incredibly stupid if not criminal which is the formula for something bad super bad happening and we're not communicating that fact to kids without telling that 18 year old boy who goes to a frat party if you get Blotto drunk you are putting yourself at risk other people at risk right there's a sense that alcohol is a kind of harmless it's not harmless it is a dangerous dangerous drug makes me so makes it more dangerous is not being aware of the consequences of what happens and it's not just I think we've done a fairly decent job in recent years of not driving while drunk or not doing certain things when you're intoxicated but what talking to strangers allows us to see is that it's even deeper than that it's deeper than I can't if I am wasted right now I have no way to really understand who you are or what you want right so we're having a conversation and I'm I'm half as smart as I normally am at all thought of Tomorrow has fallen away and then maybe I'm blacked out so I can't remember anything people forget being blackout drunk is not the same as being passed out I can I can walk and talk and communicate and tell jokes and wave my hands in the air it's just been forming new memories so think about two people you got a boy who's like 18 and full of hormones and what does he want out of party absolutely we know what he wants in a party when I ask you to go she ate that with a woman and who knows what his what he's is he if she also so blackout drunk so if she says no get away from me he doesn't remember it right or care or care about the consequences of yeah also not reading any of the signals not reading any of the signals this is interesting to me because when I was thinking get out this is certainly not an excuse it's just an explanation it's exactly right not an excuse. It's an explanation so I was thinking that in many of these cases when people have been blackout drunk and people think of course you should remember of course you should know of course you did that perhaps they don't in the Stanford rape case one of the heartbreaking things is Jane Doe the victim her last memory is at midnight before she'd even Matt or salad and her next memory is waking up in the hospital and not knowing why she's there it's all gone right and I think that that's sort of what made that makes a case extraordinary poignant and it's so interesting to that when surveys were done and students are asked what could we do to deter some of the sexual assault on campus people talk about everything other than drinking which I don't understand I don't understand how we got to this position we're drinking the case is going to make a difference actually cuz I think it's going to make people stand up and look at things in a different kind of way to Thomas's English muffins what does the perfect morning consist of for you flipping through your favorite magazine before getting out of bed setting a new personal best on your morning run or maybe waking up on the beach to a beautiful sunrise more importantly what kind of Thomas's English Muffin breakfast would you have obviously it'd be perfectly toasted with Chris the edges and a soft warm Setter but would you choose the Savory light multigrain option topped with butter or would you opt for a cinnamon raisin English muffin drizzled with honey or Jam of course nothing beats the original nooks and crannies English muffin decisions decisions delicious decisions Thomas's wake up to what's possible switch to some soul to soul questions do you mind sure what is the piece of wisdom you wish the leaders of the world would use in their decision-making it's okay to be wrong just is fine just say I I blew it let's just try and figure out a better way is there something about the times we're living in now that that's harder more more difficult than ever more challenging than ever do you think people say that there's something about the media culture maybe but I don't think you're the minute you get outside of New York City and Washington DC people aren't unforgiving paper is waiting for one of their leaders to stand up and say I'm sorry I screwed up help me do this better it just waiting for it I don't think they would reject that or get angry or it just has to be said with a certain amount of Grace and humility I think there is as much appetite for longing for humility. Leaders today is his ever been forgiveness forgiveness I don't think this something is fundamentally changed in human nature because people fundamentally are always doing exactly what you say defaulting to the truth they want to believe one took that's why it's it's so difficult when people are shown the truth right before the price for them to actually acknowledge that it's actually happening what's the most selfish thing you've ever seen selfless they'll selfless thing you've ever witnessed firsthand wow most is a kind of part of me is like whenever I talk to anyone I know who is a young mother and I figure out how many hours they sleep more selfless than that then waking up at there isn't there I don't got that kind of going to be top of my list I think people have to do I used to think about this all the time with my producers Terrace one of them with five kids so she's there in the in the office the same amount of time I am I come home I come home to three dogs and she goes home you step in the door there five kids who don't care that you had a whole day and what happened in that day but you you have to be just as you need to be for them and that Mom I I don't know anything more so what is the question or the mystery that sent in your mind discussion I thought I'd just for you that you hope to have answered and you are Lifetime and I asked that question because you're the one who's always uncovering the mysteries for us one question I have always wondered if that is what does it mean to change someone's mind I'm less than a short of my ability to change people's minds and I'm wondering is it because I'm doing things wrong is it because it's much more fun just to play to the people who are already in agreement with you and lie Nehring myself and just speaking to the kind of just reading this book I don't know if my mind was changed but it certainly was opened and I'm going to go and read it again because it's done that thing that you most want to do is to get people to think differently about something and what I'm always searching for and my conversations with people is that moment where you can get them or the audience to think I'll G I never thought of it that way before and this is filled with that on in every chapter usually open-minded person right I don't usually open but I'm open so my question is I had this incredibly interesting conversation with a Jesuit priest named James Martin who one of his cause is can I get my church to accept gay people is there a way for me and not accept in a sense of Houston think he can get the pope to change tray but just to embrace them treat them any as they would treat any other human being or any other Catholic and I was fascinated to talk to him about it so he is grappling with this problem can I can I change someone's mind who's not inclined to change their own their own mind is there a way for me to deal with this issue with such sensitivity and intelligence and restraint and humility that they will move from I don't want to talk about it to you know I will I will happily get up right next to someone like this on a Sunday morning I was just so kind of in awe of how he was approaching a question and unsure about how a whether I could ever figure out how to tackle a task like that well isn't it true though that you can never do it in theory I remember in all the years of the Oprah show that the way we got people to see things differently and even many times to change their mind is not by doing for example a show about gay people but incorporating in the early years gay people taking care of their children or gay people doing ordinary things that everyone else did and then you see OG they're just like they're just like me I think you have to have a sense of how I see myself in this person that person just like me until then now what does it mean to be gay because in so many other ways they are just now me where you had the really interesting point which is you had the benefit of time yes so you took people on a that lasted and I think that that was back when they came to trust you and slowly over time, you must have changed but so if put 25 years is a long time moments when a woman stopped me and she said I've been watching your show and it wasn't the first time you said it cuz I didn't believe you she said but it's because you have been consistent since you been consistent and I want you in every time you talk about kids you say don't hit your kids or hit your kids and then you talk like a l don't get her kids she said that I'm like how you going to have a good chance you don't get them so she said the last time I heard you talk about hitting your kids I said I'm going to try it for one week she said so I went a week and I didn't hit my check and then I want another week and I didn't hit my kid and she said it's been 3 months and I haven't hit my kid and I have a different kid and I'm a different mother so it's not one thing it's the overtime you no idea of introducing patients into the process is really crucial though like maybe we get into trouble when we're just two we can do we can do these kinds of changes overnight and what we need to do is accept the fact that it's a 25-year process yes I read this book and then ended up calling you because I wanted to have a conversation and I feel that way I feel so passionately when I experienced something that changes the way I see myself and I see others which I think is what this book is done so I want people to read talking to strangers because it's one of those experiences that will actually change the way you not to see strangers it will change the way you look at the news it will change the way you experience all encounters with other people send this off to your publisher and you had done the final page and brought us all the way back around to Sandra Bland your deepest hope for the book was that we would all acknowledge our complicity in the death of Sandra Bland that that wasn't about a rogue cop in a stupid in a small town and what have you it was about that we have institutionalized ways of dealing with strangers that make no sense we have asked police officers required them force them pushed up to making judgments about people that shouldn't be made you were saying baby about some of what it look like but there was also so much more there was so much what we have designed this last part of the book is really about how are these faulty ideas about doing the strangers affected the way our law enforcement system is designed an answer is all the things we talked about assumptions about transparency default the truth to match what is in a matcha a fit into a Philosophy of Law & Order which has had disastrous results so you didn't let us forget to Sandra Bland thank you I'm Oprah Winfrey and you've been listening to Super Soul conversations podcast you can follow Super Soul on Instagram Twitter and Facebook if you

broken record in apple podcasts introduction step out of the car in July 2015 a young African-American woman named Sandra Bland drove from her hometown of Chicago to a little town an hour west of Houston she was interviewing for a job at Prairie View A&M University a school should graduated from a few years before she was tall and striking with a personality to match she belong to the sigma gamma rho sorority in college and played in the marching band she volunteered for the seniors group she regularly posted short inspirational videos on YouTube under the handle Sandy speaks they often begin good morning my beautiful kings and queens Kings and I am up today just praising God thanking his name definitely thinking him not just because it's my birthday but thanking him for growth thanking him for the different things that he has done in my life over this past year but just looking back at the 28 years that I've been on this Earth and all that he has shown me even though I've made some mistakes I have definitely messed up he still love me and I want to let my kings and queens know out there that he still loves you too Glenn got the job at Prairie View she was elated her plan was to get a master's degree in political science on the side on the afternoon of July 10th she left the university to get groceries and she made a right turn onto the highway that Rings the Prairie View campus she was pulled over by a State Trooper his name was Brian encinia he was a white man wearing the Troopers wide-brim hat and sunglasses he was courteous at least at first he told her that she had failed to signal Lane change he ask your questions she answered them then landed a cigarette and Insignia asked her to put it out there subsequent interaction was recorded by the video camera on Insidious dashboard and has been viewed in one form or another several million times on YouTube but you can step on out now talk to you or I will remove you getting removed for step out or I will remove you I'm giving you a lawful order Glenn says she will call her lawyer in city and reaches into the car and says to her I'll yank you out of here then tells him not to touch her and says she's not under arrest t-shirts that she is under arrest at this point Sandra Bland starts to record things with your cell phone did you try to give me a time so I can get out of the car I'm going to drag you out of here so what you up to now encinia has pointed his taser apple and she gets out of the car but keeps recording right yeah yeah that's that your support a few seconds later blend turns off her phone as Insignia orders are to do she was arrested and jailed three days later she committed suicide in her cell the Sandra Bland case came in the middle of a strange interlude in American public life began in the late summer of 2014 when an 18 year old black man named Michael Brown was shot to death by police officer in Ferguson Missouri he had just allegedly shoplifted a pack of cigars from a convenience store the next several years saw one high-profile case after another involving police violence against black people they were riots and protests around the country a civil rights movement black lives matter was born for a time this was what Americans talked about perhaps you remember some of the names of those in the news in Baltimore young black man named Freddie gray was arrested for carrying a pocket knife and fell into a coma in the back of a police van in Minneapolis a young black man named philando Castile was pulled over by police officer and inexplicably shot 7 times after handing over his proof of insurance in New York City a black man named Eric Garner was approached by a group of police officers on suspicion that he was illegally selling cigarettes and was choked to death in the ensuing struggle in North Charleston South Carolina a black man named Walter Scott was stopped for a non-functioning taillight he ran from his car and was shot to death from behind by a white police officer Scott was killed on April 4th 2015 Sandra Bland gave him his own episode of Sandy speaks Illinois was the only black girl on the all white cheerleader Squad so I had to learn how to deal with and black people you will not be successful in this world until you learn how to work with white people white folks to really understand out there black people are truly what do it we were doing as much as we can and we can't help but get pissed off when we see situation where it's clear the black life matters but those are you questioning why was he running away because in the news that we seen as of late you can stand their surrender to the cops and still be killed three months later she too is dead talking to strangers is an attempt to understand what really happened by the side of the highway that day in rural Texas why I write a book about a traffic stop gone awry because the debate spawn by that string of cases was deeply unsatisfying one side made the discussion about racism looking down at the case from 10,000 ft examined each detail of each case with a magnifying glass what was the police officer like what did he do precisely one side soft Forest but no trees the other side saw trees and the forest each side was right in its own way Prejudice and incompetence go a long way towards explaining social dysfunction in the United States but what do you do with either of these diagnoses aside from balling in full or dismiss to try harder next time there are bad cops there are bias cops conservatives prefer the former explanation liberals the ladder in the end the two sides cancelled each other out police officers still kill people in the United States but those tests no longer command the news I suspect that you may have had to pause for a moment to remember who Sandra Bland was we put aside those controversies after a decent interval and moved on to other things I don't want to move on to other things in the 16th century they were close to 70 wars involving the Nations and states of Europe the Danes fought the swedes the polls for the Teutonic Knights the Ottomans fought the venetians the Spanish fought the French and on and on if there was a pattern to the endless conflict it was a battles overwhelmingly involve neighbors you fought the person directly across the border could always been directly across your border know you fought someone inside your own borders the ottoman war of 1509 was between two brothers throughout the majority of human history encounters hostile or otherwise we're rarely between strangers the people you met and fought often believe in the same God as you build their buildings organizer cities in the same way you did fart awards for the same weapons according to the same rules but the sixteenth centuries buddy is conflict fit none of those patterns when the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes met the Aztec ruler Montezuma II not a side knew anything about the other at all Cortez landed in Mexico in February 15-19 and slowly made his way Inland a dancing on the Aztec capital when he and his army arrived they were in awe to not take long was an extraordinary sight far larger and more impressive than any of the city's Cortes and his men would have known back in Spain it was a city on an island linked to the mainland with Bridges across by canals at Grand boulevards elaborate aquaducks driving marketplaces temples built in brilliant white stucco Public Gardens leaving the zoo it was spotlessly clean which to someone raised in the filth the medieval European cities would have seemed almost miraculous when we saw so many cities and Villages built in the water and other great towns on Dryland we were amazed and said it was like the enchantments one of Cortez is officers were called and some of our soldiers even asked whether the things that we saw was not a dream I do not know how to describe it seeing things as we did that it never been heard of or seen before not even dreamed about Spanish with cuidate Gates by an assembly the Aztec Chiefs been taken to Montezuma it was a figure of almost surreal Grandeur carried on a litter embroidered with gold and silver and festoon with flowers and precious stones one of his courtiers Advance before the procession sweeping the ground Cortes dismounted from his horse Montezuma was lowered from his litter Cortes like the Spaniard he was moved to embrace the Aztec leader only to be restrained by Montezuma's attendance no one embraced Montezuma instead the two men bow to each other are down. He art thou Montezuma Montezuma answered yes I am he no European had ever set foot in Mexico no Aztec at ever met the European Cortes knew nothing about the Aztecs except to be in all of their wealth and the extraordinary City they build do nothing of Cortez except that he had approached the Aztec Kingdom with great audacity armed with strange weapons and large mysterious animals horses that the Aztecs had never seen before is it any wonder why the meeting between Cortes and Montezuma has fascinated historians for so many centuries that moment 500 years ago when explorers began traveling across oceans an undertaking bold Expeditions in previously unknown territory and entirely new kind of encounter emerged Cortes and Montezuma wanted to have a conversation even though they knew nothing about the other when Cortes ask Montezuma art thou he he didn't say those words directly Cortez spoke only Spanish I need to bring to translators with him when was an Indian woman named malinche who have been captured by the Spanish some months before she knew the Aztec language Naruto and Mayan the language of the Mexican territory what coaches have begun his journey Cortez also had with him a Spanish priest named Jeronimo de Aguilar who's been Shipwrecked in the Yucatan and learn Mayan during his sojourn there so Cortez spoke to Aguilar in Spanish translated into Mayan for malinche and malinche translated the Mayan into Naruto from Montezuma Montezuma replied yes I am the lung translation chain red and reverse the kind of easy face-to-face interaction that each had lived with his entire life had suddenly become hopelessly complicated Cortez was taken to one of Montezuma's Palace has a place it Aguilar describe later as having innumerable rooms inside and Chambers Splendid Halls mattresses of large cloaks pillows of leather entry fiber and admirable white fur robes after dinner Montezuma rejoin Cortes and his men and gave a speech immediately the confusion began the way the Spanish interpreted Montezuma's remarks the Aztec King was making an astonishing concession he believed Cortes to be a God the Fulfillment of an ancient prophecy that said an exiled AIT would one day return from the East and he was as a result surrendering to Cortez you can imagine Cortez reaction This Magnificent City effectively his but is that really what month is in my mint now at all the language of the Aztecs had a reverential mode a royal figures such as much as Uma would speak in a kind of code according to a cultural tradition in which the powerful projected their status through an elaborate false humility the word at all for a noble a story in Matthew West all points out is all but identical to the word for child when a ruler such as much as Uma spoke of himself as small and weak in other words he was actually suddenly drawing attention to the fact that he was esteemed and Powerful the impossibility of adequately translating such language is obvious rest all rights the speaker was often obliged to say the opposite of what he really meant was embedded in the use of reverential language stripped of these nuances in Translation and distorted to the use of multiple interpreters Not only was it unlikely that a speech such as Montezuma's would be actually understood but it was probable that its meaning would be turned upside down in that case Montezuma speech was not his surrender it was his acceptance of a Spanish surrender you probably remember from high school history how the encounter between Cortes and Montezuma ended what is Uma was taken hostage by Cortes been murdered the two sides went to war as many as twenty million Aztecs perished by the directed the hands of the Spanish or indirectly from the diseases they had brought with them to note was destroyed his foray into Mexico ushered in the era of catastrophic Colonial expansion and it also introduced a new and distinctly modern pattern of social interaction today we are now thrown into contact all the time with people whose assumptions perspectives and backgrounds are different from our own the modern world is not two brothers feuding for control of the Ottoman Empire it is Cortes and Montezuma struggling to understand each other through multiple layers of translators talking to strangers is about why we are so bad at that act 2 translation each of the chapters that follows is devoted to understanding a different aspect of the stranger problem you will have heard of many of these samples are taken from the news at Stanford University in Northern California a first-year student named Brock Turner meets a woman at a party and by the end of the evening he is in police custody had Pennsylvania State University the full assistant coach of the School's football team Jerry Sandusky is found guilty of pedophilia and the president of the school and two of his top aides are found to be complicit in his crimes he will hear about a spy who went years undetected at the highest levels of the Pentagon about the man who brought down hedge fund manager Bernie Madoff about the false conviction of the American exchange student Amanda Knox and about the suicide of the poet Sylvia Plath in all of these cases parties involved relied on a set of strategies to translate another's words and intentions and in each case something went very wrong in talking to strangers I want to understand those strategies analyze them critique them figure out where they came from find out how to fix them at the end of the book I will come back to Sandra Bland because there is something about the encounter by the side of the road that ought to Hondas think about how hard it was Sandra Bland was not someone Brian encinia new from the neighborhood or down the street that would have been easy Sandy how are you be a little more careful next time instead you have Bland from Chicago and encinia from Texas when a man and the Other Woman one white and one black one a police officer and what a civilian one armed and the other unarmed they were strangers to each other if we were more thoughtful as a society if we were willing to engage in some soul-searching about how we approach and makes sense of strangers Sandra Bland would not have ended up dead in a Texas jail cell
