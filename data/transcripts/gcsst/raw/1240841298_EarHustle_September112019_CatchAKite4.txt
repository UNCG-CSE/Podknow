I'm Corey Thomas writer of the play lock-down this episode of ear hustle contains explicit language please be advised this may not be for every listener discretion is advised can you show Nigel the two signs you showed me today your house all right age and go twice ear hustle that's the sign for the day you are now tuned in the ear hustle from PRX His Radio Topia IRS on New York Thomas a resident of San Quentin State Prison in California for about eight years now and together we're going to answer some of your questions at your hustle my name is Florida from Madison Wisconsin area this is a cat a cat episode where we answered listeners questions and FYI kite is slang for notes passed around in prison I know when I went to reception to record for a first episode this season I actually saw kites flying all over the tear like these little birds they're going by so fast I wasn't even sure what I was seeing those with just regular notes going up in that case I have these little tiny writing and it's small and you can't see me just get around the prison by Magic tiny writing I love that but in any case we asked you listeners to record a question in email it to us and we got a lot of them at least a hundred so thanks to everyone who sent mine in the ones about wife inside with help from guys on a yard and some dude who came down to the studio to be part of the conversation life post-incarceration hi guys. Hey there hi my name is Molly I live in Atlanta but I'm originally from Oakland and my question is whether it's hard to sleep in prison with the noise or the temperature and weather You all take naps during the day thanks Molly New York I don't know about you but since this podcast started I hardly sleep and so how's your sleep these days actually not sleep well and I will know what has nothing to do with the podcast it's just hot when is San Quentin your ability to sleep soundly depends not only on your mattress or the temperature but also on where your house you have cell blocks and then you have dorm living topic of conversation here which is better sell living or dorm living and Yorkie live in a cell and does annoys there keep you from sleeping pretty quiet until about 3 a.m. that's when you hit a plaka Gates Rockin to the kitchen workers can get released the head to the kitchen Jenna man down so what happens if there's an emergency guys are start yelling Man Down sell 582 or whatever sell it is and other guys are joining interrupting to like a chorus into the seals all the way down a friend at the podium can hear us and respond and get the guy some help okay so back to sell Living vs. dorm living there is no choice in the matter some guys are assigned to cells and other guys to do aren't so New York can you explain why that is so usually what they do is God that have under 10 years left to serve on this sentence they get sent down to the dorms lifers and guys with a whole bunch of time and cells so that means you've never seen the dorms I'm not allowed to go down there just like the dawn guys aren't allowed to come to the cell blocks but you've been to a dorm. Yeah it's unit I wasn't there at night but wow during the day it is so chaotic it's this big concrete building with light a hundred bunk beds in it and everyone's moving around their stuff everywhere loud voices you hear people on the shower and I'm sorry it smells like men smell like in a locker room but they have access to all day showers but it still is pungent down there and it is freaking loud but don't take it from me here's Angel who lives and sleeps in h unit as you can see I'm one of the few racks that has a window and it's raining right now but normally when it's hot I can open the window and I got a cool little breeze coming through first if you live in the middle of the dorm you better have a fan or is bad and you got the blurring light in your face all night long I have to sleep with a beanie over my eyes so it's dark we've mentioned this before in the podcast but it's never really dark in prison but have to keep it like this with a seals can make sure that we're still here and nothing bad is happening in the shadows and more storms is relatively quiet but like you just kind of get used to the noise after a while it is just what it is you just got to deal with it you know New York you guys were ear plugs I mean how do they deal with all that noise so remember I live it like the condo sale housing unit where there isn't much noise after 9 p.m. and I'm just thankful to God that I don't have to live in those dorms well we wanted to hear more about sleeping in dorms so we asked our go to stand up comedian Jesse Aires to come down to the media lab and answer Molly's question we put him in front of the mic and just let him go interesting question the everything in prison is made of cement and steel sleeping in a Cell gives you a little privacy and isolates noises for sleeping in the dorm as loud as fuck every time I lock the door slams or Domino's slaps on the table it's like a crack when the toilet flushes all you hear is called all night long the roof of the door is made of sheet metal so when it rains all you hear is allowed ass okay hard to sleep at night in the dorm but what about napping Molly was concerned whether or not we took naps during the day back to Jesse breakfast come back you're feeling kind of drives you like you know what Imma take a nap real quick soon as you lay down here the PA system start crackle on Garcia Jones Rodriguez 5 minutes later class is canceled Electronics the only way to avoid all that bullshit all the noodle grooving all these motherfuckers yelling at cops on the porch I just turn on my fan plugs around my face I might fuck it next question also sound related this guy had a few questions for us actually this is his second one from London again it's a question why isn't the music in prison playing in the background for this question because she s institutional knowledge on this issue has changed there used to be playing in the background of prison a lot of people start getting boomboxes all at one time and yeah it change the whole soundscape of prison you would hear music coming out of each person sell and it would be like really music that will tell you a lot about that person yeah I remember that yeah like it was yeah I got that like stuck in time and when you walk by that sell you. Just My Imagination Running Away with me how you got other interesting thing about that is how you seen the time travel from cell to cell rock music another guy might be paying rap Mexican Nationals might be playing their music and so you getting all these different experiences just walking on the tier and no need to classical music guys might have been afraid to play their music out loud I don't think I've ever heard they told me about once nope classy enough to wear headphones so they can get every note yeah yeah but when the Boombox came in and just like turn the whole soundscape in the prison in to dismiss my sound and so you had all these individuals competing with their own type of music and I think a lot of people complained about it I think the CEO's that walk at ears or had to sit in the office in here a hundred guys on the team are playing different music at some point complained about it as well and it became a problem and so to prevent noise pollution or to stop noise pollution they started all these ordinances and Aquinas to wear headphones to life in prison just got quiet I mean they don't provide any elevator music no Beethoven No Lil Wayne nothing no to Metallica our Lord everybody just walk around with their heads not in the you don't know what they're playing in your left the wonder what soundtrack is it in their mind like what what would they listen to what would be your soundtrack in prison if we pulled out their earbuds what would we hear so it this guy named Eddie from London man one is why I like in prison and have no background music no theme song If you could choose a theme song for your life in prison what would it be but I made it here I've had my share of ups and downs but I mean Buffalo Soldier jail roster stolen from Africa brought to America a Freddy's Dead that's what I said We Found Love right where we are song I don't wake up in the morning and the sunlight hits my ass is going to be a lovely day lovely day lovely day I turned 21 in prison doing 60 in life I always feel like somebody's watching me I always feel like somebody's watching me Mike Mike Weston hi there my name is Karen and I live in Colorado and I used to be a sign language interpreter so I find myself wondering how deaf people fair and prison that must be incredibly difficult do they provide sign language interpreting services for them on a day-to-day basis or are they totally dependent on lip reading which isn't easy and writing notes kind of a thing well we don't have too many guys here at San Quentin at a hearing impaired right now but in the fall we got a group coming in and I know somebody who's really excited to meet them my name is Tommy Lee worker and I've been in prison for 18 years my older brother is deaf so I grew up with it that's how I talk to my brother was using my hands and learn sign language I miss my brother bad but come September I'm told that 10 death prisoners are coming to San Quentin trying to get as many as I can't prisoners as well as officers to know the basic signs for shower yard dinner count to simple science Church in a Manual Alphabet like I said earlier this this is my brother's community in this opportunity and I'm in prison and I've got a release date of 2050 so it could be awhile before I get out to the community to work with any deaf community and they're coming here so it's going to be a reward when I get to talk to the deaf community and welcome welcome them to to San Quentin sotamies going to be there when the new group of hearing impaired man arrived and he's going to be busy not only signing with them but also teaching the rudiments of sign language to CEOs and any other guy who wants to learn but that's not all the preparation is going on recently there was a town hall meeting in Santaquin about the incoming hearing impaired population the anisado was there she works as a sign language interpreter with in cdcr and she told us about the challenges of signing in prison and honestly the language changes everyday I mean I had to learn all the prison terminology when I started working there but can you tell us some of the prison song you had to learn I would sign jail with these guys and maybe like not we're not in jail or in prison and so they would correct me and show me how to sign prison and then just like I terminology is like the hole when they go to add side and 115 hearings and committee and canteen and it'll just terms that we don't use on the street Bruno did you have a chance to make up a sign for stuff like some prison slang and hearing-impaired guys use those same prison acronyms so can you translate them for the listener New York like ad-seg hearing we try to get out of trouble before captain or lieutenant and you tell me why you're not guilty of a rule violation there's another group of San Quentin with hearing issues there's a rapidly ageing population here and some of the guys have lost partial hearing like Norman Wilhoit and so can you any differently talking louder which which is the preacher purpose of hearing aids if you talk louder to begin with a start calling me Grandpa Grant double OG hello this is

hustle that's betterhealth.com ear hustle on behalf of the whole ear hustle team thanks for listening I was just wondering if me and whining noise when you educate a student from your in prison I'm a public defender in Southern California how often do the inmates think about their lawyer or blame their lawyer or think about them positively or negatively just curious so New York did you play me returning you know I used to blame my attorney for not being prepared for trial for not investigating enough but not listen to me and when we lost trial he wouldn't do half of the time with me now she's okay but what about now now I realize that I wouldn't need a good lawyer if I hadn't been a criminal the first place experience with a public defender I had I had a dump truck man you know what's a dump truck a dump truck is a fucked-up attorney you know who don't we don't do shit the right way because one time I was fighting his dope case right and you know it was like my umpteenth drug charge right anyway though right so I just said okay I'll take two years we can give me two years all right I'll take it so when are you going to go up in there and he couldn't get me the two-year deal and came back with these all well. This that they're in the other and started blaming all kinds of other shit on it I was like man fuck you man so he saw that lawyer today would you give me a hug I don't think I give him a hug I will probably just you know just say what's up just let me know gullible like my boy want Angels about to tell us for me I do know I was guilty so you know even that at the time when I was trying to get out of all this mess felt like a public defender that was a sign of my kids did a phenomenal job of trying to claw out the truth you know so see you never once called your public defender dump truck no I mean I wish I was the guy I was that guy you know I had a bunch of lies that I fed my public defender in in in she just ran with them you know so I was like I can't believe she went for that one to you know so I felt bad it's like how many lights can I build to say I wasn't the guy in that picture holding that bag of money walking out of the bank it was me could you please explain and this is Valerie from San Francisco I have a question so my husband is coming home after 24 years in a couple months where MW I met while incarcerated and we're going together for a few years now I was just wondering if you guys had any suggestions we have great communication everything is great and wonderful but I know that he gets anxiety sometimes I was just kind of wondering what suggestions you had for his reintegration thank you question the outside with our co-host earlonne Woods Valerie hello how you doing thanks for your question and I must admit it's the first time I heard MWI BMW I8 BMW is the never seen that but to answer your question Valerie I wouldn't talk to two couples Chappelle and Tracy and Ray and Chappelle did 20 years and parole from San Quinn in December of 2017 hears his wife Tracey he wouldn't even want to order his own meals when he went out and he wanted to sit facing the door what else did you do Samsung listening to you he didn't feel comfortable walking in the mall he walks kind of like behind me like he didn't want to take the lead when it came to doing anything it sounds like there was another being in that room was that was that was that was a joke because she appear in his life for control on that guys when they get out sometimes have a really hard time making decisions decisions on the menu at a restaurant who has the luxury problems like a 401 k u medical should you know all that stuff is just issues and you don't have those type of problems in prison because you don't have a lot of choices except for a lot of stuff is given to you or most of the time she just decided for you but Chappelle also says there's something else to look out for when someone's coming home I'm thinking person coming home you need space you need your individual space is that like the she shed and a man cave yeah smart mine was different because I didn't come from a cell come from a dorm so the bathroom situation and all that stuff wasn't an issue but it was like your quiet time you'll see your Solitude that you was that you normally used to that you still look for it here man prison is so crazy all the time it's like an additive picnic just driving you crazy and always being looked at but let's go to the second couple my name is Ray Ford I was incarcerated for 31 years I met my wife while incarcerated her name is Bertha forward like Ray said we've been married for 20 plus years and I met him while he was incarcerated some of the problems that I encountered the biggest thing was patient on my part have to be patient because their way of thinking is completely different I will tell you this with my husband first came home you know how you think I got to work out he was still working out taking a shower washing his workout clothes in the bathtub and putting it on the fan to dry things like that you have to be to consider but it's all good and like I said patient and the biggest thing is prayer hi this is Maggie calling from Santa Cruz my question is for both our lawn and Nigel I'm just wondering how your relationship is changed now that her lawn has a free man I just seems like such an interesting Dynamic where Nigel was free to come and go and Earl on had to stay put and now that your co-workers and more on it equal playing field and can share things and you know go out to eat and talk freely I guess I'm just wondering how your relationship is changed to fit all thank you okay I love this question I can answer this question you cook better food than what she was bringing it into prison and so now I'm able to eat the food that she cook you know it for us and our relationship goes back to food because I was stuck on you was bringing the same thing in for like 10 years ago interchanging is one is that we
