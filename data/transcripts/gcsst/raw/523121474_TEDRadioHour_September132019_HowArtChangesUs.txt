hey it's guy here and Anna show where can I explore the power of art how we can provoke the strongest emotions or how it can transform in Tire neighborhoods and even know how it can help us re-examine our history this episode is called how are changes us and it originally aired in November of 2017 this is the TED Radio Hour each week round breaking TED Talks does the human imagination had to believe in impossible things true nature of reality beckons just beyond those talks those ideas adapted for radio from NPR a guy Roz not too long ago painter and sculptor Titus kaphar was visiting the Natural History Museum in New York for this kids that's where two kids two boys an elderly at save in is 10 and Davon is 800 Titus as boys were walking up to the museum and right at the entrance there's this famous sculpture of Teddy Roosevelt it's the Towering larger-than-life bronze sculpture that sits on this 6 ft tall pedestal and Teddy Roosevelt sits on the horse boldly controlling the animal with one arm he's proud and sitting straight up and charging forward at Sam's and then on either side of him are African-American and native-american I've walked past set sculpture I've been in that museums more times I can count but we were walking up while the sun sees that sculpture of Teddy Roosevelt and without skipping a beat my son says how come he gets to ride while they have to walk and stop me in my tracks there's so much history and we would have to go through to try to explain that it is guitar picks up the story from the stage the question that I probably would have never really asked but fundamentally what he was saying was that doesn't look fair and why is this thing that's so not fair sitting outside of such an amazing institution and its question got me wondering is there a way for us to amend our public sculptures not erase them but is there a way to amend them and the reason Titus uses the word amend is because he doesn't want us to forget our past but to confront it he wants us to take a hard look at all of the paintings and sculptures and monuments that glorify a difficult and complicated history very painful history and we have to find ways to address it we can't pretend like not talking about it is going to work we tried that we have to create a space for conversation something has to be done show today on the show ideas about how art has the power to revoke a feeling shift Consciousness start a difficult conversation even influence at debate about our past and present and future that's for Titus he's been wrestling with these questions for years ever since he was an art student back in the late 1990s one of the last our history classes I will not forget it was one of those survey our history class where they try to teach you the entire history of are talking about cave paintings and Jackson Pollock just crunch together all in it doesn't really work but they try anyway at the beginning of the semester I looked at the book and in this 400-page book was about a 14-page section that was on black people and painting. This was a crammed infection that had representations of black people in painting and black people who painted it was poorly curated excited about it because in all the other classes that I had we didn't even have that conversation so imagine my surprise on the day that we're supposed to go over that particular after my professor announces we're going to skip this chapter today because we do not have time to go through it I'm sorry hold on I'm sorry this is a really important chapter to me are we going to go over it at any point that is we don't have time for this I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry please I really need to understand it clearly the author thinks that this is significant why are we skipping over this time I do not have time for this I went to her office hours I ended up getting kicked out of her office I went to the dean the dean finally told me I can't force her to teach anything and I knew in that moment if I wanted to understand this history if I wanted to understand the roles of those folks who had to walk I'll try going to have to figure that out myself at this point what did you start to notice about this history about how Africans and African-Americans were being portrayed in an art by and large the representation of black people in the history of Western painting is enslaved in servitude or impoverished they are often pushed to the corners of the compositions they're hidden there in the shadows and so what we have are these representations of black people that don't reflect their Humanity and you're thinking we're not talking about this this is not just like not summon were even acknowledging I mean absolutely I mean by that time I had already fallen in love with the making of of paintings it's a my particular interest was trying to teach myself how to represent black skin and when I see those paintings these are the characters at I feel first I know where they're hidden I know how they're hidden and sew-in in your artwork you do you you should bring these characters out of hiding right exactly sometimes there's an image that I will find in a history book and I will remake that painting and once I've represented represented the original painting then I attempt to insert a narrative that pulls a hidden figure more to the foreground more to the surface above you right here on this slide is it painting by Franz Haas this is one of the kinds of images that was in that chapter I taught myself how to paint by going to museums and looking at images like this can you test can you describe the Franz Halls painting what would it looks like it's it's a very prototypical European portrait of an aristocratic very wealthy family you have this expansive landscape in the background you have a little dog off to the side we see the father figure in the painting is at the highest point in the composition and then in the background there is this little black child I want to show you something I made this you'll see there's some slight differences in the painting your own Recreation of that same front house painting there's more written about dogs in our history than there are about this other character here I can find out more about the lace that the woman is wearing in this painting then I can about this character hear about his dreams about his hopes about what she wanted out of life all this art history helped me to realize that painting is a visual language where everything in the painting is Meaningful is important it's coded but sometimes because of the compositional higher it's hard to see other things excellent latest break-in because at this point in your talk the the brushstrokes which is which is what we're hearing in the background you are actually painting over the images of the other family members the white family members what you know what looks like white paint and so the only figure that's left on the canvas is that the little black child that Franz halls I meant to fade into the background that's right minutes that's absolutely right and the original painting is black figure is is so under focused that it is difficult to see him as individual to see him as a person so in many cases in the paintings that I make like this I take brush to Canvas and try to bring a live what I see and try to illuminate what I think the original painter didn't see and so I am connected to this this black figure who was in the shadows and I had the exciting opportunity and privilege to sort of pull him but at the same time and in this is important to point out because I was eight I was lucky enough to be there in CVS you're not just white washing these other figures you're not actually erasing them right exactly and so the paint that I'm applying this white paint with extra amounts of linseed oil in it extra amount of Damar varnish and it will in fact become more translucent overtime and so those figures will always be set back a little bit but they will not disappear they will not be erased I don't want you to think that this is about eradication if not we can erase this history it's real we have to know what I'm trying to do what I'm trying to show you is how to shift your gaze just slightly just momentarily I'm trying to answer that question that my son had gotten some have to walk what is the impact of these kinds of sculptures at museums of these kinds of paintings on some of our most vulnerable and Society seeing these kind of depictions himself all the time I want to make paintings sculptures that are honest that wrestle with the struggles of our past but speak to the diversity and the advances of our present we can't do that by taking an eraser and getting rid of stuff that's just not going to work I think that we should do it in the same way the American Constitution works when we have a situation where we want to change a law in the American Constitution we don't waste the other one is an amendment something that says this is where we work but this is where we are right now I figure if we can do that then that will help us understand a little bit about where we're going in a moment

Thanks for having me I'm delighted to be here or close appreciated check out the NPR politics podcast feed for exclusive interviews with all the candidates on the debate stage subscribe it's the TED Radio Hour from NPR I'm guy Roz and on the show today how art can change us and for artist Titus kaphar art has the power to help us reconcile where we finding where we want to go how do you know you point out that art can shape perceptions and and reinforce even the most Insidious and and destructive use and of course right now there's a lot of debate heated debate happening about public monuments in the US and some people want you don't want to keep them and others think they're inappropriate racist and want to tear them down and I'm just seriously what do you think about this if the question is binary keep it or tear it down tear down but the question doesn't have to be binary I think if we engage a new generation of contemporary artists to make new monuments that stand next to these old monuments and force those old monuments into a dialogue I think we have an opportunity to create a new Civic space around these monuments that can actually help us move towards the resolution of this year's generations of racism that those old sculptures represent his any you're in your artwork you you deliberately aren't trying to erase history that that is the core of what you do you know the name of the street that goes from whatever Clans members named it was and then you put Martin Luther King Drive on there I don't ever want it to be forgotten that someone got away with that with using that name this symbol of racism placard on our streets placard on our squares artwork sculptures monuments I don't want us to forget that we have to ask ourselves how did that happen how was it that someone said I want to make a monument to this confederate soldier in this area which is surrounded by people that this man fought to suppress my concern is that it can be an easy cop-out yeah we can just change the name and pretend like that decision was never made and no one actually has to take responsibility but if the thing stands there and the contemporary artist comes in and makes another piece that is just unbelievably poignant and it's it boldly next to this older sculpture then all of a sudden that oppressive visual voice that that object has on the people who walk by get silenced and it gets silence without having to tear it down heart has the power to move the dial like like move a needle in a really significant way I do I do I mean I have this dream of this new WPA where we begin to put part and squares again and murals on walls and buildings and things and it would create a space for conversation it's not going to solve the problem but it does say in a very strong and a very bold way that we are moving towards acknowledging this as a nation and saying look this does not reflect our national values this does not reflect our Constitution and we are trying to acknowledge that we are trying to repair that and we're trying to move forward that's artist Titus kaphar you can see his talk and the final version of the painting Titus started on the Ted stage by going to Ted NPR. Org can you tell me about how the Favela painting project started like did you guys just go to Rio and has her check them out know it was actually a different unit he had won a competition to make a documentary for MTV this is Ron and Rhea Lana's friend and fellow artist room koolhaas made that documentary it was about Brazilian hip-hop music in the favelas of Rio but their time in Brazil led to another art project something completely different we were making the documentary we were just spending a lot of time with the people there was constant return of this word image that people in society around the slums they had to search an image of what the Favela was like and what the people from the Favela we're like and we were also thinking I could we also make some sort of a statements individual statement was his thing that came to mind immediately I could we just make something that looks nice so that if I'll look at the place and then you already know that they're going to dislike it now that was said they're confronted with something beautiful and it was kind of changed their mind to the idea that came up with was to create a giant mural spread across many many buildings that you would have to look at it from a distance to see the entire thing and they decided to stay in Brazil and give it a shot I think our roles change your locks when we travel like we unless we arrive somewhere else documentary maker and we leave as a socially responsible painter here's Trey and Arun on the Ted stage three houses in the center of the community that we start here we made a few designs and everybody like this design of a boy flying a kite the best we started painting in the first thing we did was to paint everything blue and we saw that looked already pretty good but they hated it the people live there really hated that they said what did you do you pay for their house in exactly the same color as the police station NFL that are that is not a good thing also the same color as the prison cell so we quickly went ahead and we painted the boy but still it wasn't good because a little kids started coming up to us and it said you know it's a boyfriend a kite but where's this kite we said you know you have to imagine a kite and they said no no no we want to see the kite so we quickly install the kite way up high on the hill so that you could see the boy flying the Kite and you can actually see a kite to the local news study writing about it which is great and then even Guardian wrote about it notorious loan becomes Open Air Academy I mean the perception of fellows he is at these are unwelcoming dangerous ugly places and part of what you were trying to do is to to change that perception by actually trip Overland this beautiful piece of artwork over the fella he was almost forcing people to think about it in a different way. It's totally an invitation to think about the people that live there in a different way and I remember very well that the participants in our project I mean we work with like big groups of people that are from the neighborhood so it's not just us but there was a piece written in the newspaper and they talks about the inhabitants as artists and other criminals and that was like a game-changer for them this is not running about us as people I think that really got to us and I can just wasn't really like a super predetermined plan this is something that we stumbled about like this happen and then we thought that my God if this happened in other small skip build it. Let's make it ten times bigger and see if it happens again that's what Dre in your room did they went to another Favela in Rio and started on another large-scale art project II painting we made was actually not on the wall but it wasn't a complete Street and we painted the giant River Affleck Japanese Koi carp it was quite insane it's like the most unexpected thing de Santa Marta project was sick with simple at the end of just looks like a very simple happy explosion of colors that's all I can describe it as it goes over like 27 different houses and as our projects attracted more attention they started to get requests from all over the world for the last 10 years we just running around. So then we received an unexpected phone call from the Philadelphia mural arts program and they had this question if this would actually work in North Philly which is why the poorest neighborhoods in the United States so we immediately said yes the project took almost two years to complete and we made individual designs for every single house on the Avenue that we painted can we make these designs together with the local store owners the building owners and a team of about a dozen young men and women they were hired and then they were trained as painters and together they transformed their own neighborhood the whole street into a giant Patchwork of color it's amazing when you see images of it from above like a drone image or from far away I mean I don't know what it looked like before but you can imagine that it did have a pretty big impact on that neighborhood on that Community you're totally and I love to follow link my Instagram is mostly people from different projects where we worked in lift and I'm following a lot of the people that live in Philadelphia and it's great to see that the painting still has like a big impact on their images like the pictures that they take her music videos that they make that people that do dance shows in front of them or clothing designers come out into their fashion shows there and it just becomes like a thing like their neighborhood is D colorful neighborhood that we sometimes when we we think about transforming neighborhoods are communities or doing big public projects we don't just consider something as simple as a beauty Wright Lake Butte definitely transform psychologically transform how people think about their own spaces and places to qualities its beauty and its attention if you do if the two-year project you showed two years worth of full-time love and dedication to a neighborhood and its people and it's something that people take very very serious a good example was when we arrived we we put posters everywhere we flyer than we have people going door-to-door asking the merchants to come together for a meeting and it was only three people that came out like there's always these three people met and we did the same thing after the project was done and we needed to change like at the venue because it couldn't hold all the people and everybody came together and made to taste the world but that mean that shows something you can find out more about Dre and the ruins projects at their website The Villa painting.com and you can watch their talk at ted.com what are you doing in New York for sure I came to me some people from the future project that's going to happen 2018 what's the socratic can talk about it happen and then we took about it I'll cede he's a french-born artist whose parents immigrated from Tunisia and his work is actually a little like Drake We're on Elsie these larger-than-life murals in poor neighborhoods all around the world but there's an important difference use Arabic calligraphy of my men medium it's an art form that goes back centuries and it basically transforms letters from the Arabic alphabet into all kinds of designs and Elsie and sees his work is a way to change how people relate to the Arabic language and culture I'm sure you know with my work to be an ambassador for the beauty of it trying to show how open minded we are sewart can be used as a way to bring light into committing to a 19 to what I can subject that sometimes people are like a scared I don't know what I just give importance this thing is not important to talk about specific quotes that reflect the places he's painting or Troy with my work with a message that I ride to create a connection you know so he was a quote from a bishop from the first century originally from Alexandria Egypt and the coast and you want to see the sunlight clearly needs wipees ice first in London he used a quote from John Locke in Brazil a quote from a Brazilian poet and in his parents Hometown in Tunisia he painted the side of a minaret with a verse from the Quran Elsie told that story on the Ted stage in 2012 when he painted the minaret of jam mosque in my hometown of Galvez in south of Tunisia I never said that you would bring so much attention to City at the beginning I was just looking for work in my hometown and it happened at the minaret was busy 94ae for 18 years does 57 meter of concrete degree when I met the amount for the first time and I told him what I wanted to do but thank God you finally came and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it and if you work do I create all right messages we might start up calligraffiti a mix of calligraphy and graffiti art or poetry for the the most relevant message to be put on the most should come from Quran so I pick these verse all humankind we have created you from the matter of the female and made you people in tribe so you may know each other he was a universal code for peace tolerance and acceptance coming from the side that we don't really portray the Goodwin the middle I was amazing to see how they look at Community elected to the painting and how you made them proud to see the mineral getting so much attention from International press all around the world for the amount he was not just a painting he was read deeper than that you hope that this minarette would become a monument for the city and attract people to this forget in place of Tunisia the University of the message the political context of Tunisia this time and the fact that I was writing in graffiti everywhere not insignificant it related to communities bringing people future generation together through Arabic calligraphy is what I do writing messages is the ascent of my artwork you don't need to know the meaning to keep the peace I think that'll be Street touches your soul before it reaches your eyes there is no Beauty need that you don't need to translate Arabic script speak to anyone I believe to you to you to you to anybody and then when you get the meaning you feel connected to it I always make sure to write messages that are relevant to the place where I'm painting but messages that have universal dimension so anybody around the world can connect to it I imagine that when people see one of your murals like this this amazing Arabic calligraphy on this huge minaret I mean I'm sure people are ferocious struck by the size and the beauty of it but but then they probably walk away you know thinking about the Arabic language differently thinking about it as art I hope you wouldn't do this if you can do more at 7 better you know I remember there was a cheetah project in 2013 that was called Last Words which was Neck Road Trip or on Tunisia and the and going to places that has history but people forget about it. Let me go and dig into this history Sol we want and I remember there was a small world in the city and ask people sitting in Cafe with This one belongs to and the guy said it's mine and someone out of donut would fit and these are a young man with black an older man who came like screaming at me then you what are you doing and my cat and I got mine cuz I can't sorry I mean I didn't know that was your word to somebody from the cafe Tony Bennett's to him you know this is my world and you cannot do this you need to realize that I would do it but please can you just let me finish and I will just paint over it was like okay so it's okay and 2 hours after I was almost done and he said his nephew back and then if she was like actually my income like hippies and ask you to keep it so I don't sometime I just a piece of what can just change the mind of somebody yeah and I think that's the purpose of what I do like you bring people that come from different parts of the world different social class different religious or political beliefs and you put them in the same place and you know you just blur or those differences in what comes out to humanity artist Elsie you can hear his talk and see some of his amazing images at Ted. Npr.org ideas about how are changes us and gyros near listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR support for this podcast in the following message come from the Walton Family Foundation where opportunity takes route more information is available at Walton Family Foundation. Org when you think of country music you probably have a particular image in mind but as you can imagine the history is way more complicated this week on through line we sit down with filmmaker Ken Burns to talk about his new documentary about the origins of country music through line from NPR the podcast will we go back in time to understand the present it's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Raj and imma show today ideas about the saddle power of art to transform the way each of us sees the world I say something similar to that I always say like art won't solve world hunger or War but it can provoke people to critically think hopefully this is Magda sayeg she's a textile artist and she basically invented yarn bombing instead of spray can I picked up knitting essentially covers random objects on the street in yard it's kind of like knitting a sweater for a stop sign or a street Pole or fire hydrants done 30-foot statues I've done stairwells I've done columns expand the seven stories that are hundred in in circumference the capital of some of my biggest projects are definitely the bus in Mexico City that happened in 2007 the whole entire time it was considered the largest object to be covered in knitting and then from that point on it I just wanted to go bigger or weirder or do hundreds of small things so you know I couldn't stop. It feels like like in the middle of the night like magical elves came in and just needed all this cool stuff everywhere seen it and I think these elves came in and made this happen why do do it incognito you no one gave you permission to do this so you kind of have to do it without getting caught now granted people would knitting don't usually look like after threatening and anyway and it's not really caustic or people don't really consider it vandalism but it's you know it's going on other people's property or city property and putting a knitting on it so how did you start doing this like how to start I was barely Thirty and I was sitting in my shop I had a clothing shop back then then I it was a cold winter day and it was very gray and I personally wanted to see something handmade and colorful and something to put a smile on my face and made me happy and so I admitted the door handle and it was a very selfish Pursuit I didn't care what other people thought I wanted this the little did I know that people that would pass by my shop we're also sort of intrigue that affected by it and they would walk in and ask me about it and I really did not realize that it would have this kind of effect on other people here is Magda sayeg head stage so clearly the reaction was interesting and intriguing and I thought what else could I do could I do something like in the public domain that we get the same reaction so I wrapped the stop sign pole near my house the reaction was wild it was like people would park their cars and and and get out of the cars and stare at it and take pictures of it and take pictures next to it and all of that was really exciting to me I wanted to do every stop sign pole in the neighborhood and a more than I did the stronger the reaction so this point I'm smitten I'm hooked this was all seductive I found my new passion any Urban environment was my playground and I realized something we all live in this fast-paced digital world we still crave and desire something that's relatable I think we've become desensitized by are overdeveloped cities that we live in and and billboards and and advertisements in giant parking lots and we don't even complain about that stuff anymore so when you stumble upon a stop sign pole that's wrapped in knitting and it seems so out of place and then it gradually weirdly you find a connection to it that is the moment that is the moment I love and that isn't what I love to share with others all right so eventually you start to do bigger projects all over the world and one of them is a statue of a guy holding a gun can you tell me about that yes it is a statue of a soldier and I went with cases and cases of material because my original intention was to cover the statue but when I got there and I looked at the Statue stared at it for a solid 20 minutes I realized the significance the meaning that I wanted to cheat would be from the the weapons you know that the dagger and the gun that he was holding this sort of bronze statue very assertive Stern and yarn covered pistol in a yarn covered her and like these bright because I like yarny colors with me because there is something really significant and this simple gesture of taking this material that represent nothing but love I mean I can't imagine it representing anything else you know you need it for love you can get for someone that you care for and to put it on an object that only represents our instinct to kill hatred and to me it felt very significant to cover this weapon and symbolically obliterated and paralyze its function by covering it with love isn't just yours anymore right I mean people all over the world to pick this up if you love covered tanks and the bull statue on Wall Street and it's kind of like your work on that statue I mean it it has a pretty powerful message right because it's it's a lot different than covering a stop sign or or bike rack with yarn obsoletely I think that there's different meaning as a response or has a social agenda to it and it's it's quite successful we see this craft is something that's functional as domestic it we see it as a woman Woman's Work and we're taking out of all of those different boxes and putting it in this other world and reshaping objects with it and re-identify in them and enhancing them and even shining a new light on them and I think that people are intrigued by that and if I can send a good message out then that makes me so happy as an artist you hope that you can stimulate conversation and and help community and help connection happen and dialogue with each other that's what I believe art can do that's textile artist Magda sayeg you can see her full talk and some of her work at 10. Com can you remember a time when you played music for somebody and it it had a profound change on what was going on around around them it's hard for me to remember a time when I played music when it didn't have that effect on people because that's the given I consider music to be a transformational experience this is Benjamin Zander I'm the conductor of the Boston Philharmonic and the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra which by the way we're hearing right now with Benjamin conducting Xander says music is transformational he doesn't necessarily mean it can change the world but it has the power to change us from within Mendelssohn music is a much more precise language than words and when you think how easily we misunderstand words and God knows there's enough evidence of that at this time but music speaks directly to the heart it speaks through the molecules and it's irresistible described as a conductor from the Ted stage I had an amazing experience I was 45 years old I've been conducting for 20 years and I'm suddenly had a realization the conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound my picture appears on the front of the CD with a conductor doesn't make a sound he depends to his power on his ability to make other people powerful it was totally life to Envy X2 came up to me and said that's what happened I realize my job was to awaken possibility in other people's because I want you to know what I was doing that and you know how you find out your look at the eyes is that eyes are shining you know you're doing it is the ice and not showing you get to ask a question and this is the question who am I being but my players eyes are not shiny and you don't have a definition of success for me it's very simple it's not about wealth and fame and power it's about how many shiny eyes I have around me walk me through your understanding of the physiological experience of of music what is it what is it what what happens to us well it's a fascinating thing it's based in nature and I were talking about tonal music atonal music is another method says something else but in tonal music if I go. everybody feels in that lost note a desire which is in that note to resolve itself to and if it doesn't there's a frustration does the sense of expectation not fulfilled and so since everybody feels that the composer can play with the tonal language in such a way that he can set up expectation satisfaction the sense of coming home the sense of being far removed from home and all the emotions that human beings are capable of feeling can be represented in music chill music is a motive write it it draws you in and you can change the way you experience something it says it was like why when you watch a movie it can make you cry right but if you saw that sing movie without the music and wouldn't have the same effect me that there's something and motive about music that pulls Us in that kind of phrase emotions and I don't know why do you do you know why well it is just think of it the other way can you imagine the movie without music it's the music that generates the emotions that releases The Human Experience and it doesn't of course through the way the Music Works which is it doesn't go through the brain and goes through the molecules shift some molecules you can get you whatever feeling and it was a great composers of film music know how to do that to turn it on as if they're turning at Apple dials on a machine there is something about it that changes the experience of whether it's a movie or watching or a moment you're experiencing it can it can make it so much more profound at me music it's like it's like it's like putting salt on a tomato in it and it fits but it just awakens things it awakens experience in a way that can actually believed to a consequential outcome mean it can make people do things and change things and feel things no question about it it's the great bring us together with music and it's one thing to hear it in your earphones alone it's quite another thing to hear is in a concert hall with two thousand other people who are all experiencing it together and who's reaction and spontaneous enthusiasm but the end is part of the experience and on a tour when you go from one town to another and you play for people you have the sense of people come out of those concerts with a different feeling about life for the different perspective with a different sense of being and that's why we do it and we keep doing it to me keep doing it in as I approach my 80th birthday I have no intention of stopping at any point from doing it because it's my life. That's what I get my charger in my life from it's the sense that people's lives are really transformed subhanallah sets age you play this piece by by Chopin but but first you ask everyone to do something right yes think of somebody who you adore who's no longer there a beloved grandmother I love her somebody in your life who you love with all your heart bring that person into your mind and you'll see everything that your pad to say why why did you choose that piece by Chopin what what is a simple idea it begins on a note and then he falls over the course of the peace from that note which is the dominant true the Tony at the end and most pieces of music actually have that Journey from a way to home from the dominant to the tonic it doesn't an extremely beautiful way and it's emotionally amazingly satisfied it's a must appease and chilling a very few moments with a short explanation you can actually reach everybody it's like a story it's like in the archetypal story exactly music is the stories and unfolding of a story I need to open sea emotional pause to all of life's experience and that's the purpose of transformation do you make me wondering you may be wondering why I'm fasting while I did this to the school in Boston but about 17 7th graders 12 year olds and I did exactly what I did with you and I told him it explain the whole thing at the end they went crazy traffic Denver traffic tell me what happened to me I was in Ireland during the troubles 10 years ago and I was working with some Catholic and Protestant kids on the conflict resolution and I did this with them a risky thing to do to save a streak kids and one of them came to me the next morning and he said you know I've never listen to classical music in my life but when you play that shopping piece is that my brother was shot last year and I didn't cry for him but last night when you played that BC was the one I was thinking about and I felt the tears streaming down my face and you know it felt really good to crush my brother so I made up my mind at that moment the classical music is for everybody everybody Benjamin Zander you can see his entire talk at ted.com how to draw I want to see the boys and girls that's enough you can be anything in the world and God keeps right thanks for listening to the show this week if you want to find out more about who was on it go to Ted.
