There was just something about the emotion and that moment. this isn't a story where you going to be the option to go home it stays with you Patron pizza what's a father's well before we get started this is the very first episode of the lead and since you and I are the hosts I thought maybe we should just quickly explain what the show is so the lead is the show I always wish existed I'm a sports writer but I was a sports fan first and it's really all about great stories great stories from great Sports reporters who are all over the country I mean he's our journalists who live in the cities and know these teams and know these players or you don't have to be a fan of those teams or those players to care about these stories for example in this first episode you talked to Larry holder who has covered the New Orleans Saints for almost 15 years about why that terrible call a season provoked such an unprecedented response it really helped me to understand why Saints fans did what they did and why fans at yesterday's game we're so demoralized it's really something anyone can identify with so should we get to the story let's go for it soleri let's start with a very basic question how important is football is the game of football to the City of New Orleans Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans August 2005 in course everyone is recovering from the storm people are literally taking their FEMA checks to buy Saints season tickets that's how important the Saints are to this community and I'd say without the Saints returning to the city at that point I don't think the city would have ever actually rebounded so I would say unlike many if any NFL fan base within the league all right so let's go back to this incredible no call it's last year's NFC Championship game the Saints and the Rams are tied in the 4th quarter and the Saints look like they're about to score and book a trip to the Superbowl Walker's 3 what happens next Tommy Lee Lewis was really kind of an unknown receiver with in the Saints receiving Corps he's not one of their top targets he's basically running free down the sideline Breeze and then Nickell Robey Coleman in absolute desperation flies basically headfirst into tommylee Lewis as Drew Brees has a perfect pass says incomplete no flag for Tommy Lee Lewis to officials are looking at each other one looks like he's about to take the flag out and throw it a second one basically says no no no and it's not pass interference or a helmet-to-helmet call which is also of course he legal in the NFL and play just goes on sitting here here in the stadium when this happens with how does the crowd react it was under a ghast is going crazy as there's no flag right on the Saints sideline then where's the replay they put it up in the on the bay screens in the Superdome and everyone loses their minds the man and you add it all together and it became a complete and utter debacle the Rams get the ball back the Saints defense is probably a little bit in shellshock the Rams drive down the field they kick a field goal percentage over time the Saints get the ball first in overtime Drew Brees is hit throws interception which means when the Rams get the ball back all they've got to do is kick a field goal that was a preview of the first episode of the lead to hear the rest of the episode listen And subscribe to the lead on Apple podcasts or wherever you're listening right now
