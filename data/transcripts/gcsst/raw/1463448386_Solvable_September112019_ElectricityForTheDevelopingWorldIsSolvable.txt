Is solvable interviews with the world's most Innovative thinkers who are working to solve the world's biggest problems my soul Ablaze to take energy to wake communities are we are not going to solve poverty in the 21st century if we don't solve energy poverty in conversation between an alpha bottom and ashvin Dayal about well energy the solvable this episode is how to bring reliable electricity to rural communities across India and Africa Ashman leads the Rockefeller foundation's efforts to not only and energy poverty but also to unleash Economic Opportunity across the world's 1.2 billion people do not have electricity experience living without electricity even for a day or two you'll know how frustrating it is a small task suddenly become huge and everything takes so much longer on a bigger scale energy poverty is a massive impediment to sustained economic and social growth be alternatives to electricity are not idea nearly three billion people cook or heat their homes by burning polluting fuels like woods and of course that results in air pollution that causes widespread health problems that things are improving just slowly according to the latest data from the UN 85% of the global population now has access to basic electricity services Boosie this has been dying to government's efforts in extending National Grid's as well as some of grade decentralized projects but for a spin dial the challenges to reach every last person has been made the Rockefeller foundation's Global smart power initiative he is overseeing the foundation's investment in renewable energy many grades in India and it's working to achieve electrification for everybody in India no matter where they live you think this is something that everyone will be on board for you know but Ashton says that's not the case have you ever heard of the diesel Mafia well let's take a listen and I'll speak to you after when people speak about something so vast as a billion people without electricity a lot of people would just be distressed by that they would think this is too big a problem I can't solve it I can't think about it when you originally approach this problem how did you think about it what led you to the solutions that you found did you break up the problem did you took it a piece of it what was the thought process that you went through I think the first thing I really thought about is why is this even a problem why do we care about the fact that a billion people don't have access to electricity when you look at the world around you today and you see how the economy is a more interconnected when you see how you know what you do in the village can be connected to what's happening in the markets in the nearby towns and then what's happening in the cities when you look at the level of international trade the pathway to Prosperity is in fact an energy dependent pathway if you want to move a little bit up the value chain as a farmer you need to have some processing you need to have some cold storage you need to have some Transportation how you need to have irrigation the all of these things that slowly incrementally allow a small holder in rear of your gun in Bihar in India text to move up the ladder once you get your head around why then you stopped looking to break it down into a why isn't it getting fixed it why are there a billion people I guess it can seem daunting but if you think back 20 years ago probably fall billion people didn't have access to any form of communications the world was waiting for landlines to reach the farthest points of every part of India or Southern Africa and then Along Came mobile technology and within a generational Less almost everyone on the planet is able to access Communications is able to speak to people that they able to download information and so this possibility of disruption and the possibility of applying the latest that we haven't technology to another sector like energy what's something that we started to to Really experiment with and look at quite deeply seven or eight years ago as we saw the price of solar technology coming down as we saw a new small companies starting to experiment with becoming essentially Standalone utilities providers of electricity into communities that the bay companies the big utilities just one prepared to go because they saw them as lost making and we saw an opportunity and so it's from there that we ready started to build our understanding of what the problem is how it could be solved at and the role that we could play in it and the solution you saw was to units of energy or small or kinds of energy generation including just individual solar sales people can have individual small sources of energy right there needing to be connected to a Big Grid so yes Lighting in the home is extremely important enough for a child to do that studies at night for women to feel safe and you know just for your personal quality of life to be able to plug in a fan so that you can stay cool in the end often what I extremely hot climates that we have to charge your mobile phone let me have you talked about not being available 20 years ago those are all extremely important facets of such as social life and well-being that extremely extremely important but if you also want the power irrigation pumps if you also want to allow a carpenter to use mechanize tools if you also want to help small collectible farmers do that processing of that weed the grinding of that weed on site so that they get a better price you need a slightly higher grade of electricity than just what a home system can light so that took us to what we called mini grits these are essentially anywhere between 20 to 500 kilowatts in a megawatt stand-alone Power Systems and they have solar panels they have the power electronics and you have a little grid maybe one or two kilometre radius supplying the village Supply in the homes supplying the business has answered have decoupled from the National Grid that's the area that we felt was most important because it brought both the economic development opportunity together with improving quality of life inside the home which of these aren't individual power sources it's a mini griddle a small power source for a small area of souls that's a thousand people you you have one system it may sub say a hundred of those households because the other hundred may be so kind of phone this power it'll serve 20 or 30 businesses maybe 20 or 30 shops in that area sometimes it'll even serve a cell tower that was previously dependent on diesel in order to operate so yes these are small systems but the larger than the individual homes and so they need an ecosystem of companies and government policies and other things to be available in order for for the sector to flourish breakthrough that was necessary with is there some form of energy generation that you couldn't have done 20 years ago that you can do now that makes this work I think the biggest breakthrough we've seen as with soda we've all in different ways the amazing and dramatic Frankie dropping cost of soda and efficiency of solar panels over the last 15-20 years come down by itself almost 10 x so technology per se but it's the price of Technology that's really been most important that started to allow us to get to that sweet spot where these systems can actually work they can generate power at a price that communities are able to pay and willing to pay because they see the benefits for themselves and they see the improve incomes best inexpensive and they still need to come down for the so there are still things that have to happen for this to absolutely spread like wildfire if you like the way mobile phones did 20 years ago and that's essentially the thing that we try to solve is how do we take this great idea this great opportunity and get it to the point where it can truly take off is that really a commercial question is it to do is selling it is it to do with Distributing it what are the big obstacles to installing these many grids so the installing of the many good is actually the simplest part of it it is a commercial challenge you are trying to serve the poorest end of the market these are consumers utilities don't go to because they see them as lost making for every unit of electricity they sell its understanding demand is treating low income households and enrolled Myanmar India as consumers as an addressable Market but understanding that market what do they actually need how much can they pay how do you supply it in a way that is flexible to that needs so not just saying he has a me to consume as much power as you want and we'll give you a bill at the end of the month and you know all of a sudden you realize you can't afford it but actually maybe what you need is a package so that you can create overtime as a mini grid operator a viable business that's probably one of the biggest challenges and and honestly we're not there yet we still need to in we need to drive prices down we need to get better at predicting what the demand will be in any given Village so that people can size their systems appropriately and we also need help from government in the sense of seeing that says positive a solution inside slow Mission this is what they do you have ministries of energy and ministries of electricity but they have tended to adopt a single solution which is really extend the great and will keep extending it as quickly as we can and you know it'll get you when it gets to you and there's a massive opportunity cost around that so it's it's really the dialogue with government to say look we can build the Great from the outside-in but you need to create a policy environment that allows a mini good developer to go out somewhere and not worry that in five years if the grid erised I suddenly have a stranded acid you may need to look at what's of the fiscal tax incentives you can give to offset some of the commercial challenges that still exist and most importantly we need to plan electrification as a combination of great enough grade and choose the best Solutions in the areas where they make the most sense if you have a village right next to the greater probably makes sense to just extend the grid that but if you have another community of a thousand people looking at 10 kilometers away from the grid it actually doesn't make sense to extend the grade 5 years from now it makes a lot more sense to create the incentives and the policy is that allow a man to get operator to set up an independent system there and rather than that Community waiting five or six or seven or eight years and you can have one of these systems up in 3 months but it takes collaboration it takes us to the public-private Partnerships are the mindset for this to happen and and and that's a lot about what I'm trying to inspire in working with both companies as well as investors is one of the government's island of course most importantly Community organizations on the ground and do you have a set of tactics is there a way to talk to governments to seeing it from your point of view of all of the evidence and you can go into your set of dialogues without going to be do all of that but there's nothing like sitting seeing is believing so actually bringing Regulators people from the distribution companies in the utilities are from the Ministries to the sites showing them what mini grid operators are going and saying look you should actually be claiming this you should be saying this is part of the government's efforts to Electrify everyone so one tactic is just the seeing is believing right there is also just making the business case for it from a kind of National Economic Development point of view that is an opportunity cost to not electrifying a village in today's modern economy it means that Village confidence is Peyton all of the opportunities that are out there whether to the agricultural the oil off fam I think the thing that often resonates the most with government is when you say look this is actually a development play this is not just an infrastructure project this is about unleashing New Economic Opportunity it's about addressing the bobbity challenge that you as a government Care Centre about so it's the narrative here that we have to see this as a national development effort not just meant for structure effort and then the human development effort and show that you can actually save money overall if you are more thoughtful about how you combined grid Investments and offered Investments blending both the best of the public with the public sector can bring and and what private-sector can break just to give you an example of either there is the idea of a results-based financing you know so no country in the world has actually electrified it's Thai population without some level of government investment in in public finance and what we're saying is you could incentivize to these results based financing schemes private operators to go and set these many grades up in communities that your grid operators are not ready to go to and for a fraction of the cost of the subsidy that you would provide to the grade instead providers as some sort of performance-based incentive to a private company let them go there at 8 or you're creating a quickest solution it can be more sustainable to the commercially in the medium dumb and eventually you can integrate the soul back into a single what we would call a set of a smart grid which is a grid that you the way you can have slows going both ways between the consumers and the generators of power and once you put that subdivision in front of Ministries and government officials you know you start to find eyes that are lighting up and champions Imaging tell me that your work with private entrepreneurs is that very different from the government is there are there kind of buccaneering entrepreneurial people running mini-grid companies you can offer advice to or is this something that you have to spend a lot of time persuading people that this is a good thing to do social entrepreneurs and quite small companies going out and trying to you know where they just have strong conviction around renewable energy and around and Aggie access to poor communities and you know web largely all the way with companies they would read lying a lot on grant funding to get the early proof of Concepts out and we have two certainly encourage companies at a slightly larger scale to spot the opportunity in India we must have spoken to I would say about 75 to maybe as much as a hundred different companies away in some way related to the energy space but we're not specifically working on Rural electrification so maybe they were equipment manufacturers for some of the systems in a solar manufacturers or they were companies doing energy Supply to cell towers in rural areas so there was some way connected to the ecosystem but I haven't quite seen this as an opportunity that list whittled down from you know 75-200 down less than 10 but really wanted to then get him because this was still seen as a young field a market that was unproven and Frankie high risk and so even though we were able to provide them with concessional capital would like low-cost loans it was still a big risk for them to enter those that have have started to do in a reasonably well the first company that we invested in India called omnigrid micro power Corporation has gone on to raise about 10 times as much capital from other investors to expand their operations and doing really well the people for whom these grids are being built did they say why aren't we being connected to the main grid today do they appreciate this kind of this Innovative technology and do they like the idea of it or is there of some resistance best rated resistance if the service is provided it is high quality and it is truly customer-oriented what do you tend to find is a lot of frustration with the National Grid's with state-owned utilities that have been providing a very erratic service making promises that they can't then meet our experiences somewhere between 97 to 98 % collection efficiency which is basically an industry dump you know how much of your revenues are you actually recovering on time relatively high levels of customer satisfaction to using industry benchmarks for customer satisfaction you know it said of 75 80 85 per-cent which is regarded as as pretty good when you consider that most large utilities have satisfaction ratings at fifty-five 60% I'm at your that's probably true even in the developed world are Utilities in in rural India and Africa used to thinking in terms of customer satisfaction or was that also something you know. The last mile customer as a loss-making beneficiary of some government program rather than a viable consumer so the relationship is completely different between these private companies and Kazuma as there's an accountability that is a substandard that is met there's a complaints mechanism and at the end of the day if you have an unhappy customer you have a bottom line that's getting effective to this incentive basic commercial incentives to perform all of that said your original question about the grid being a preference is is also an important question because Grid electricity is Biolage significantly cheaper because it's subsidized so there is a larger so the question about what is it fair that a low-income consumer in rural Bihar or in rural Uganda is paying an equivalent rate per unit of electricity that is higher than what an urban cancer Lori Perry up and Kazuma is paying when supplied by the grid and I guess you know the answer to that is fundamentally no it's not fair but is it beneficial to them in terms of improving their incomes improving the quality of their life and helping them reduce the cost of consuming alternative dirty and expensive feels like kerosene or diesel absolutely so these are informed consumers who vote with their feet they make the choices that they no benefit them we must address that question over time that's why we talked about building the great from the outside in and eventually integrating because at the end of the day in 10 years time not only do we want everyone to have access to electricity but it needs to be affordable it needs to be reliable it needs to be Equitable and so we still have big big questions that took to deal with this solar itself have an appeal to people say wow this is a kind of energy they can see that it's clean it doesn't produce smoke it's comes from the sun that is that appealing or is that just give people that sense it's not reliable it's appealing to governments it's appealing to invest has it couple of pills but if you look at it from there to the lens of the actual consumer sitting in their home and in one of these places it's what is it displacing right so it's not that it's so low it's that I don't have a smoke filled room with because I'm using a kerosene lamp if I'm a small shopkeeper it's not that it's solar it's that I don't have a little diesel generator right next to me and I'm making a hell of a racket and and spewing out noxious fumes I often say look these are some of the the lowest consumers of energy in the world I think we have an obligation given where we are is a planet to make sure that the Energy System of the future is green and is sustainable and is largely based on renewable energy I would not put the responsibility for that transition on the shoulders of the people that we're trying to serve we promote renewable technology with these consumers because it offers a disruptive solution to get energy to them in a way that has never happened before problem in and trying to carry it out can you think of moments of real frustration I mean are there people or companies or incidents that made you think going to this is never going to work or it's just not going to happen yeah every day to do something that is different you often come up against forces that comfortable with the status quo when we set up the first set of many goods and India you know they were a mysterious things would happen lines would get cut in the middle of the night why is would be ripped down pole to be destroyed album and we discovered over time that they were interest in the diesel ecosystem in that are the diesel Mafia is it's called that wanted to see this fail but you know what is community stop to see that they really benefiting from it that they actually create a set of an almost like an invisible ring of protection around that because if if the people who are ultimately consuming this wanted they find ways of making sure that if it doesn't get as disrupted I'm so we had some of that early on in other thing I worry most about is probably has a lot of things I worry about what does a couple of areas where I feel like we really have to see the biggest breakthrough one is in government and in being able to really despite all of the openness that they might be to one solve this problem there are also some very traditional and calcified ways of thinking about electrification but also there are champions within all of these countries who are thinking about Battle of sympathetic are the other cutting-edge technology companies were thinking about electricity in zone in different in different ways how sympathetic related to this problem do you have very few have trouble getting big companies to focus on this kind of issue not not at all I think there's actually it's more than just sympathetic a lot of these companies see this as a market I mean this is like I said a billion people and they are starting to invest if you look at every major energy utility at a global level from n l to NG to Shell to Total each and every one of them has an off-grid a rural electrification business unit that is starting to explore what they can do starting to make I would say small midsize investments in the space and what we're trying to do is nudge them along and say this is great let's keep working together let us do the things that maybe you as a company, and invest in to help open up the sector as a whole and we hope that there are more of them going to be poised to enter into this Market we are in partnership with several of them now and I think there's only going to be more coming in the future so it's not just about being sympathetic it's it's very much in their own interest to see decentralized renewable energy as the way of the future point for there to be kind of Tipping Point whereby the delivery of this kind of energy will be commercially viable and nobody will need to know the Rockefeller Foundation to explain to them why it's necessary or how it can be done to see that happening I hope so because you know we cannot do this alone and we can light the spark we can operate in the spaces that Tina foundations in philanthropy is a particularly good at which is ugly beige high risk. Making all debt and Equity investing I think the big breakthrough will come when a large African country commits itself Plata integrated electrification planning and investment and starts to really create a significant public-private partnership that combines the best of Saddam grid-scale with Afrin I don't Tipping Point is would be a major company like the ones I mentioned earlier in India talk about something like that committing to a very large of crib because what that will do is also Drive the prices down you know part of the price challenges also just scale in the Technologies out there solar panels have have pretty much come down to the level let me know they will but there's other components that cost a lot of money that way we have to still squeeze 15-20 25% out of the cost if I can order 10,000 units of something I can do that overnight so that's a pretty omensight to this was just requires a scale play and I think that will be a Tipping Point that I'm very confident we will see that you know within the next three to five years are probably so. Like today lots of food for thought they're like how private companies are more Nimble and more willing to take risks than governments but that can make energy more expensive and also this made me realize just how far we've come that's the reason for Hope right there you know as Ashton says just 20 years ago there were four billion people without access to telecommunications and look at us now I only feel alive when I'm on Instagram I'm joking kind of the Rockefeller foundation with production by chalk and blade pushkin's executive producer is Mia LaBelle engineering by Jason gambrel and the fine folks at GSI Studios original music composed by Pascal wise special times to Maggie Taylor Heather Fein do near Barton Kylie migliori Sherry Vincent Jacob Weisberg and Malcolm Gladwell you can learn more about solving today's biggest problems at Rockefeller Foundation.
