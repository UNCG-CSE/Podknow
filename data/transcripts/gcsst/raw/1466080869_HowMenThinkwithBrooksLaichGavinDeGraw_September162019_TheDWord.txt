Just pissed yeah really yeah and it's fun it's fun to be in a pissed-off mood cuz I think that was a lot of that was hockey play Nights Fun. I used to love having enemies that's a fun cuz you get to it's so much anime how to release another way of releasing emotion like it's a big pendulum swing of emotion like rage is fun anger is fun to feel it's driving it's motivating it's not where I want to live and spend my life but just to swing the pendulum that way is sometimes very glad to have a therapist coming again because I think that when I should be mad I feel sad but I think it's interesting Ocean Isle by not being mad I don't have I rarely get mad I get like a punching bag in your apartment or condo and let's just turn that sadness into any time you feel said you was going on leash on this punching bag see what it does is making men are more comfortable with anger and women get sad that would be a great time for now that they're going to be a whole lot of yelling and crying and still be great great topic for show cuz I really don't get sad I get frustrated or angry I got two most everyday wow almost everyday can I hear Matt there or like watching TV or like today about tickets to see Oprah happy cry like or did you cry cuz they were they were expensive. Wow okay okay with your brakes I like to get mad I don't like to like get mad and rage at people like something that's a real yeah so I usually like to yell at people and other cars with something that I've no idea like you can't see someone in the car so I'll be like you skinny bastard didn't but I have no idea what they look like I don't have a lot of road rage I don't think but I tap into like rage when I need to like like when lifting when working out a lot of times like I'll tap into the emotion that came up when I was competing against another guy cuz hockey the face-to-face there was there was blunt-force physical conflict in hockey and so that taught me to level up my intensity and emotion and also like rage sometimes sometimes a guy would get the best of you and provoke a bear and you that maybe you didn't even know you had and so I learn to harness that over years of professional sport and now if I want I have it on access where I can access it if I want to tap into something that's more powerful than maybe my current state then I'll come right over this studio counter in a couple weeks maybe a great episode speaking of episodes though last week we did life after loss and Mitchell story was exceptionally we've got so much in amazing feedback from you guys reading the emails and the direct messages on Instagram the feedback from our community has been exception about life after loss how many people have related to it and how many people are inspired by Mitch's story and this week free to go into something close but not quite as severe maybe but life after divorce ever speak with a couple people that have a great divorce and I just want to ask you guys I got your are your parents still married know my my parents separated when I was 4 and it was pretty nasty yeah yeah it was bad for a long time and it wasn't until I think maybe I was in college at they actually something happened in the family may start to get the day started speaking again like it was pretty bad for years almost like yeah 14th almost 15 years on your for 15 18 years later they started speaking again yeah and it was like like if wife a call cuz you can have cell phones back then if if somebody called the house to talk to the kids the other one be like like it was like hold on like that wouldn't even talk to wasn't High how I had I was just yet anyway it was pretty nasty two years did you ever like have triggers are issues in your own marriage from their divorce no actually I think I learned a lot from going through all of that that I was more aware of kind of stuff that did wrong and how they handled it and think so I think it was I think it probably educated I was stuff to go through but I think of educated me in the long run and it also just if so we're keeping score it wasn't my fault in college and I'm not saying it was like unicorns and rainbows but I do have one of those situations where it's like the unicorns and rainbows like everybody has Christmas together everybody has Thanksgiving together everybody's together all the time like there's times when my mom has my dad his wife over my aunt and uncle on my dad's side like at our house yeah everybody is pretty pretty amicable situation like there was a party my mom and dad had to go to but my dad's wife couldn't go and my mom was like oh I got to go be with Daddy doesn't have anybody to hang out with like everybody's just really yeah I heard like the opposite so my with my mom you don't marry my dad and then her brother fell in love with my dad sister and they got married so it was like brother and sister married brother and sister not really so then where my parents split my aunt and uncle didn't so it made it very awkward family events and I actually had a birthday party where I insisted when I was little Isaac I really want Mom and Dad here man was that a mistake that place blew up and up sitting on the curb with my cousin what would it what birthday 7 8 3839 I'm sorry I'm sorry I never get along again so that it was around the time their first grandchild was born that's when it kind of started was that your first check my brothers and they started kind of I remember being at the hospital with both of them in the waiting room waiting for my niece when she was born and I sarcastic like I am I turning Lego so you guys were in the hospital together since I was born like the waiting room and there was any kind of kind of broke the start over the years from there they started getting along better like they could then go to the origin of the other again it's just nuts is such a fascinating world to me because my parents just celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary couple weeks ago which is amazing and I don't have experience with divorce my wife's parents are divorced they're both happily remarried but that's my closest experience that I have friends that have had Parents divorce but I can't I cannot begin to imagine what it does to a life at the age of 4 at the age of 20 whatever age you are where your parents divorce I I just I can't imagine what those emotions are and then you're fine I will say this when I was younger I used to want that are we still want them back together and you still want that whole family Christmas and holding and as I got older and I saw who they were individuals I'm actually glad that they got to work I'm not glad that I was it went down the way it went down like kind of them not getting along but I think I'm better off in my life having experienced them living their lives the way they wanted to not trying to make it work together I'm okay with it now when I eat when it first happened I remember someone saying to me I know this seems like the worst thing ever and that you'll never get over it and he said in six months he won't remember it wasn't quite that but the words were pretty true like it's so major and then yeah it's okay it's not my fault and I did an interview buddy we got it we got some things we need to talk about but that's what we're going to get into today we have two special guests that have a very happy and enjoyable now now it's a process will say that it's a process will get

thank you for coming in to our studio appreciate that how are you guys doing fat thank you thank you for having us well I was one day but for the time being I'll have to get it clean first lady blows all our budget on the studio it is it it's a journey into finding a different kind of love and Nick and I were married seven years we had a beautiful son together we end up getting a divorce sand it serve our journey into how we got to where we are today at 12 years later she's remarried I'm remarried we have this like a better word Modern Family and its it didn't just start off like that there was that there's that there's a lot intricacies and a lot of people get divorced a lot of resentment and anger and fear and everything that goes through but we were able to simply just put our but our son first was our sort of Guiding Light and every decision we made whether that be romance Finance all the sort of things it's spiral divorces we just every decision had to answer that question and it was right from the start no with like a babysitter and not seeing each other and not talking to each other I realized the only thing we were doing was hurting him eventually it would have been I mean they would have ended up ruining his life if we would have kept on the path that we were going on and he he was seven at the time now he was three or four at three and a half of things that I've been blessed about that we talked about the book is it is a nice a blast because I had to go through this as a with my own parents divorced and it was not the greatest divorce and you know I was more like weaponized not so drastically but you know we were sort of port in the middle of it and for a while there I was filled with all that stuff I talked about and I was going to you know make her it was her fault she everyday there ending marriage was her fault everything is pointing finger at her and I had to hire this lawyer who sort of sparked or added fire to it to get to the fire and was he would tell me what I wanted it's her fault will get her and all the stuff and I spent a bunch of money and he wrote up this action plan in a business plan if you don't like how to go after it how we're going to do a barrister and do all this and make it a big public deal doesn't sound like a lawyer I kept it and I didn't read and there's something inside of me I don't know what it was but I kept in my backpack that I was carrying around for like 6 weeks and I never opened it up and for some hope I was flying back from LA on a trip and I opened up and I can read first two pages and it was at that moment that I could see things clearly it was like I had all that other and all that other stuff was gone and I I saw that if I go down this route I'm going to cause the same damage to my son that happened to Nick and I are going to rack up a huge emotional bill and make him pay for it for something he had no choice that point he was doing her own work on herself and I was doing I called her and I said that we can't talk about this right now like I have to do some things in my life to to get myself right before we can even start talking about the divorce in and so I just worked with some guy I knew in and we went through and it was only about my part we know that we never talked about what she did or what you know her fault in and it was it was all about finding my you know mistakes in the divorce and it would realize that it takes two to make it and it takes you to break it no matter what she done or matter what I do you know did all I need to focus on myself yeah so so at what point how many months or years after the separation is this when you have this realization and you start doing this work it was about four months maybe so it stays relatively new It's relatively new maybe a little bit longer I think it was about four months now maybe I'll let ya cuz I know that I decide to take 3 months was sort of my goal was to take 3 months and do what I needed to do when an end at the end of the whole work is sort of another burning bush or Clarity moment I like looked at this stuff and I was like you know what I wouldn't want to be married to me while I was a terrible miserable person and you know that intersection or that they know that that Clarity of like at you were just a bad bad guy bad husband bad father bad everything and again nothing to what she did you know it wasn't about her at that point is about me kudos to you man. Is that some that's some hard self-reflection that end at some work that I think a lot of people are not willing to do it doesn't it doesn't have to be even just in a relationship or coming out of a relationship last in their own life like to take a reflection of who I am as an individual how I show up in the world and how does my presents and my actions impact people around me and then to look at yourself and say wow I'm not proud of who I am this is not who I want to be I own these faults good for you man rights of the first step was going to go through it and look at it and it'll come to that realization and forgive myself and they call Nikki and I was getting messed up when I say this but I'm really soft but yeah me too good for coffee and the first thing I told her was that I was sorry and I loved her and I know I'm sorry for everything I did to cause the end of our marriage and she didn't turn apologize to me until she's very hard for me to tell me a joke about point the finger at her wasn't about point a finger that's what started that suede made this for sure it was his apology to you is what yeah that's what started it surprise you he did surprise me because I somehow I knew about some of the other stuff he was doing like working on I did know that I just never did know enough to mother told me things bright eyes were past all that he doesn't blame you he doesn't he's like I own this this is my fault I just want to say sorry how does that make you feel cuz I think that's a noble act like that is what made me go okay it's time like it's time for us to sit down and figure this out like we can't keep going down this path let me know so he apologized said he did all these things wrong and then he said that you also apologized now was that did you just apologize because he he apologized or did you really feel like you've done something that you could apologize for you know I was a huge part I was the other half of what made this fail so you're damn right you right I did not spend those four months trying to stop him right now and has no more plus like what the hell am I going to do like here is this woman with it has this child I mean yes I have a family that I'm really close to but what am I going to do like that's the last I mean that's how old was I don't know 20 30 I don't know 30-ish but that's the last thing any woman in Tampa with a child by herself said I was frightened and I went through four months of being scared and easily could have fallen into that category of a repeating cycle of what my parents did you know and from that moment of apology the next question I'd asked her was do you have any problem with joint custody joint in a 50/50 haven't said absolutely not because you're the father of our son and I go I looked at her and I said you know everything else can be worked out like the other stuffs trivia like that's the important thing is we can't burden him with our choice it's like we chose to get married we chose to get pregnant we chose to get divorced and here's this innocent being at no choice but we're going to stick them with any of this nonsense yeah so I have a quick question Ben Dickey and so thanks for coming in the so how did you navigate that with your son at the time as you were kind of get you said sorry to each other if you know and you weren't dropping them off at babysitters and each other's homes and you weren't seeing each other or whatever like how did you kind of did you did you bridge that Gap with your son at the same time and say to him hey look we're sorry what what's going on right now you know I want you know we want to sit you down and talk to you and and and he's so I guess it's kind of hard when he's 3 but you know I got older he was he was really young but really smart like I don't know where you got it but he's already so there was certain things that I just like if you look back he'll Sadie is even tell us he remember seeing boxes like I don't know how we ever saw box because we never but there's certain things he remembers about him leaving so there was I think we knew that we had to be as honest with him as we possibly could because he got it and that to me is what is also what started this because I mean he's 4 years old and he got it like he knew she can't hide this stuff from kids are we wanted to protect him right so I would sing at a hotel and I would drive every morning home before he got up that breakfast you know to downtown like I was there that night and one day he looked at me and he said where did you sleep last night Daddy and needed this is the four year old kid I'm like I slept in the bag as well and you did make mustard much of a mess in your bed or some like that he didn't notice it has Nikki side of the bed until like we got to give our kids more credit no matter what their age is for being aware 10m mindful of what's going on and that's something we'd done wrong but but after that it was it was just something we when we're around him we tried to keep even I think when it was bad we tried to keep at least the unified front of everything's fine but kids like I said after you guys made those apologies together then that unified front started a form a little bit better and better and then that that helped him out a lot me at lawn mower I went to we went to school this is what made us realize okay we're doing something right we went to school for like parents like whatever you parent-teacher throat a conference or your old house we recently split up and she looked at us and said really this kid hasn't skipped a beat while so that made us that was like okay we are doing something right cuz this child is not missing anything so we're doing it right but whatever we're doing we've got to keep doing it would have been horrible if she was like yeah I know everything he sees you sort of Mendes or begin to Mendes at least you set down the weapons what's the path then what follows after that you just began working together Cliburn together almost same team did a different way than being married but same team that you're both on board for what's best for your son and then is that your book now is called our happy divorce does it start to become happier between you two after that I wish I could say that you know we clicked on Snap their fingers and everything is perfect right but we had a commitment now or a mission say whatever you want to say that it was about Asher Interstate for sale at that point and so I've been looking online about this thing called collaborative divorce and is relatively new in Florida it's now a really big is it a lot of statutes and states and there's a there's there's a process for it but basically what it is is it differences instead of me calling my lawyer my lawyer calling Nikki's lawyer lawyer calling her her account you know the game telephone do you know how that would I get screwed up after like the second person right so is everybody in the room together and everybody's talking together but we actually went one step further and I think I told her we agreed let's just see if we agree on what we agree upon let's treat this like almost like a business saying and and see that the business people make the business decisions and then give it to the lawyers cuz I blew cuz my experience with the other lawyer it was like but not they're not all that being over this guy was like you know feeding me my own BS like you know cuz he saw the Big Shiny two-year divorce and whatever that cost and so we just sat down at the same coffee shop where we had apologized to each other and we just worked it out and it was amazingly easy when we had that what's best for Asher finances fell into place to studio timeshare fun plays everything just sort of fell in place so then we did it ourselves gave it a lawyer and said Radha my lawyer was pissed I paid the other guy three times as much to write that game plan or whatever how to get out of there the whole deal and then do you know to make an embarrassing and so she was pissed to Chicago going to be sure you're okay with ya brought up and how did you feel with that you were same you're excited that like you're not faking it obviously you're both on board with this you're definitely not so much easier then get the heartache of going through it just was sort of I mean it's still there but it's just taking away like there's just the pain is the pain went anywhere but it looked like you said that it didn't just all of a sudden get better like this is 12 years in the making like this is not it was like progress every day we were looking for Perfection you guys made me want to get a divorce so bad you see how he then there's a difference between got to be with the other charges are happy there was a lot of Faking like you brought up there was there was some faking it take until we made it like you know she started dating somebody who's here who's a great guy that I had known that we'd known before and you know when when you come to the Astros baseball games like I had to go over there and put on my big boy pants and swallow my ego and pretend like everything was okay at my insides are being torn apart you know all that you know fear and anger and my manhood and here's another guy with my ex-wife and with my son and but I put on a bit in a smile and sort of just developed into okay and she's going to be with somebody eventually why not make it somebody's a good guy who loves my son like I do and as good as a good influence and makes her I Don't Want to Miss a whole ex-wife I didn't want to miserable wife much less miserable actual I thought it was Ryan's brother for a second and I don't wanna mess this up but don't you all live like within a block of Sky Viper Scout you tell the guys about that because we chat night we're looking for a piece of property to buy that we're like a let's let's make an investment so we buy this property down the street Morehouse yes would be a really good investment for us to hold on to it two days later we sold it to you for the exact price we bought it nor didn't know you called me cuz I was with a sure that Golf Camp you call cuz we're looking for a place to build a house she called me and said I bought you a peaceful and I was like Nicki what happens if I don't want like it like you just bought it and she's like love you buy a jet and I'll do the best with her son but I bought you be silent so she turned around and sold to me for 2 minutes 5 houses down from a sure we added street names Longfellow we call me Longfellow creeper because he goes he loves to fish and it's on the water so he'll be at my house and he'll creep over to Nikki's house don't even know what I look like. Call Nikos our son over there and she looks out the window guys fishing inside so cuz I don't think I could do that I don't think like I have zero contact with anybody that was formerly in my life I can't you are far more emotionally advanced than I am in fact most of us if we knew that our ex or whatever was trying to buy a piece properly fry by its mass rather eat them so they? like the deal is if you look in and that's what I just try to explain people who look at this for him and you know we just got off a trip just the three of us Nikki Asher myself. African safari without Chad her husband without my wife and two kids and it was a combination so you fast for 12 years a sure when he was a kid was already has kids upset they get obsessed with one thing if it whether it's like my little ones have sex with Spider-Man or dinosaurs there an Ashley's animal seems like an animal encyclopedia and so we always wanted we always knew you were going to take him to Africa or you want to go to Africa but with the shots and everything you need to do well that sucks man sucks if you go to Africa you see the moon really really would have set us the divorce South would have been the romance finance and all the other nonsense it would have been if the other one had taken the other one Dasher to Africa without the other one of our life is is I tell my wife I tell my wife now I'm going to Africa with Nikki and Asher and she doesn't say oh hell no you're not going to have to go with your ex-wife are you crazy sleeping alone in the bush or whatever it is and instead she goes that's great actually love it I don't know if I could do that man because there's a wife and there's a husband so it all has to work it's all I could you know that's the thing is how do they have that patience or how do they have that composer cuz I'm like I'm listening to this and hopefully I'm like I love my wife and I hope I didn't ever get divorced but I'm sure there's people out there list of this same know that would never happen and never allow that I never liked how how did your significant what do you like to do when that came to him like what was your reaction to that when they said by the way we're going to have to stop I don't like that animal you brought it up. You don't have any contact with anyone in your in your past life child with that person that's true that's where the difference is and I think that's where these two are to be commended is because they made it all about the child this happy divorce This Modern family's all about the kids events to kids you know we're close to them that they think I'm their stepfather you know that come to our house sometime stay a little too long our house all the time we go trick-or-treating together you know we go on vacation together so me the part that thinks it's hard to understand is once you introduce two children into it without the children years at the right I don't think any of us would argue with you you know good riddance good luck with moving forward that's the that's the nicest I'm going to be have a good day and that's not what this was about it was about moving forward you know frasher sick for listen to talk to actually make sense to me now because how cool for him to be in Africa with his mom and his dad or was that just his parents not to step kids of your parents with just those two that's priceless going to ask that was set up just to be the two of you looked like there was never a point where was like oh Chad you want to come it was just it was just an invited to go to channel 29 hours on a plane to Good2Go I hate you know I work in Tampa couldn't take that much time off and it just wasn't going to work but more importantly I felt it was time that he should spend with those to bring in a different Dynamic we do enough of that it needed to be just the two of them that's that's something that we talked about since he was a little kid is seps obsessed with every every animal that's that's known to be from from Africa not adding would take that much then you just didn't want to get the shots doesn't have air conditioning first of all go it was amazing I was going to die right nobody accidentally I don't even think we got in a fight while we're gone there was one it was it while there was one that you were more yelling at Asher and I prefer being you know whatever we were doing but but now they were great I'm nobody there like I said there was no accidental slips office at the Safari into the lion pride or there was no but the thing is is conversation with only ones didn't work anywhere but in their rooms that made it I would like the number for us to talk of it but like we were obviously staying in separate tents or cabins and it's a book it would like lookin I go at Dasher slept with her because of the idiot really in the middle of the women elephants are walking by your early in the middle of it and so they would look and they walk past me to get dropped off and she was going to the other one and we have to explain if she's my ex-wife and then they would even that story is it it it was amazing that we did it like that but being in Africa is just a hold of you said you know it's just amazing life-changing experience. I want to go there I mean it was just a dead spot. Can you explain I don't even have enough vocabulary to explain how amazing and humbling and Melissa just figuring out how to be happily divorced was there ever a mom we like maybe we could have made this work who know know know that child was meant to be here he is he's Beyond special and I say that but he was meant to be here and I think that's I mean don't you agree I agree with you. But when I looked at my part in that whole exercise is there a walk to every red light you know and it it's nothing that you know every warning sign I remember that my way she was sick on the wedding day folks it went down took my dress off and had to go put something else and I was sick. I can't believe I'm married that dude this isn't right laugh like I remember that day like it was yesterday that this just wasn't like all the red lights that wouldn't go back and change one single thing and that's the thing that I take the store for the messages is like I am so grateful for my life today and you look back on a can't be selectively grateful right like I can't say I'm grateful for this but I'm not grateful for that so it's it's like it's like the painting rain each one's broad stroke and only works if everything's together so you're not suffered from drug addiction alcoholism I've been sober 25 years you know I had this terrible blow point in my life with the divorce and but I'm grateful for it all this stuff had to go through as a kid in my parents you know because it if I didn't go through that who knows if I would have changed actors out, so happy that will happen grateful. when you see divorced couples who are remarried have kids are moved on with their life and yet they still hold on to that anger and that bitterness and all that other negative stuff towards their acts and they can't you take a step back and go wait a sec if this didn't happen I didn't get that wouldn't have a life I have today so it all you know it's sort of a just to get you know just show up and it it happens all for a reason so you and I I think I already know the answer but do you boast genuinely wish the absolute best for each other that's amazing so that's accepts how many people leave a divorce answer divorce and just have bitterness resentment and want the other person to suffer the rest of their life for you to ask is your Nikki it's like not in my wife and I sort of had this tumultuous relationship because I cuz I was a douchebag right I mean I really wasn't although I had done all the work on myself I just wasn't getting ready to commit again or to get married again cuz I still have this idea of marriage and parents my own marriage failure I'm done with my work around the marriage how have you been charged and so but not I want to get married she want to have all the things that I already had I wanted drivers just happy with her being my girlfriend for the rest of my life right and so she left the last time before you know got engaged but it was Nikki who called me on my BS and she's like you're not going to find a better woman that what are you doing you're going to end up old and lonely give me a loan for a few hours at you you're letting a bath in a really good thing go step up and marry that woman so yeah she does a lot of gift what advice would you have for people in our community our listeners that are in a divorce maybe you're in a bad relationship with this ex husband or wife with open the mic to you guys to to give any advice to our community as you see fit to forgive yourself first in fact that a little more you have to realize how much no matter what happened in this marriage and who did what whatever you had a part in it a huge part in it you have to learn how to forgive yourself before you can forgive somebody else how to take ownership of your rolls to the message that we try to get across it in the book it and hopefully people can still hold no matter how you know what the other person dead or no matter what the situation is obviously going to let's make a copy out for some physical abuse in Dino some some non-starters right but you know everybody who's gone is going to be that bad divorce and hates their acts and which is all that hill and everything if I were to ask him what they lay in front of a bus for their kids I'm almost certain that everybody would say yes right but you don't understand that what you're doing is basically stepping out of the way and letting your kids get hit by bus you know unintentionally but through the all the all the resentment all the anger and it's so just take a step back from somebody been through it right who had to go through it is it is a tough place to be when your two parents who you love equally are you know talking about each other or whatever and you have to sit there need to take a right and it instead of it somebody else were to talk about your hair like that before I punch you in the face or hockey guy you understand it right there and I had to take it you know what just swallow it because I love my dad I love my mom and and when they were parenting from a place of not parent of the year but favorite parent right and it's just it is unintentional they didn't mean to do it in a my mom read the book and she called me and she said she was sorry and forever they check your mom you don't you know I told her the whole grateful thing though it made me who I am so I don't have to repeat those mistakes and that's so so anybody out there just like put the kids first like you sign up for you did it and I hope I don't sound preachy but like in Italian whatever I want to know what your Nikki and Ben what your take is on couples that are let's say not happy it's not a disaster but they're in a marriage it's not great and I know that but they stay together for the kids this seems to be the internal debate on whether that is a good idea or a terrible idea I mean my opinion is I think it's a terrible idea because we were like that we weren't in a bad place we weren't we were like two ships passing in the night like it we were friends she wasn't we fought sometimes but not not terribly but not like you didn't deserve and here's where it gets all Clash play I can say that's my ex-wife with her husband standing or not getting knocked out right great I mean it's but it is everybody everybody wants to be a princess every little girl wants to be a princess and Ryan Wiki don't just disregard that we we all disregard into police incident hair thank you Husband chads2 it's game questions what about the power is eyebrows that's what I really want to die twice I don't even I don't even know couples that are moderately unhappy stay together for the kids or is that a bad idea like there's a couple that are just like looking at their watch till the kids go to college and what's his name and she ate dinner that are all on their phones and nobody talking to each other no because the kids are going to end up sick feeling it they filled I mean kids aren't stupid they feel whether it's not love between two people I mean they get it we're not marriage counselors we don't pretend to be in a bunch of initials behind her name she know we're just two ordinary people who did an extraordinary all right when you get married you say I do to the concept of forever get divorced you say I do again to the concept of forever should there be a statute that says there is a limited amount of times you were permitted to say forever legally there or how many times you permitted to get married and say I do forever kiss away I'm seeing the concept of marriage in these modern times is sort of like forever for now forever for now is it that mean I understand like you know I understand getting divorced getting remarried I get it now let's say not change going to happen let's see you guys get divorced you going to get married and say forever again do you think I'm a marriage questions like I think maybe I got married young maybe some things went wrong I needed some self-correction it was wrong timing for us both of them but should there be let's see government intervention how many times you're permitted to say forever when it comes to marriage I think maybe two should be the firm that Japan and can otherwise it's kind of like she this forever again thing and then let people some people get mad for 5 x 60 at some point the same person saying or what I feel like I could have been dating forever just boyfriend girlfriend will I got anti-marriage at all but I am a little bit anti five marriages and saying her again five times its ever and ever friends of mine in Europe who don't get married that last way longer than a lot of the marriages I stayed with friends of mine in the United States you know what I'm saying and then you know the next time there's a lot of knock against crazy Millennials write the quotient formula nails but they got it right then they're the reason to divorce rates going down because they're waiting they're not getting married. Just take your 33 34 when I got married to take your time I believe the stat is that 50% of all marriages end in divorce what is the percent of second marriages that end in divorce I don't know but I wonder if it's like last side I was 20% that it's not much but it's true he's going to let us know if you googling this blanket made it work Singing River is maritime or I was quoting you all those other times marriages end in divorce is have difficulties for a number of reasons that he or she can manage divorce they are less scared of going through it again makes sense and then you're sitting up an easy thing is to write I write short suit let's talk about the book the book is called our happy divorce how ending our marriage brought us together what can people find in this book on then where can I find this book your story yet and is basically our story ever watch the show The Affair is where we alternate chapters and it's a lot of it's around like a coffee shop. Meeting is would be my perspective what I did before and then then Nikki kind of chimes in and on what you was expectin what she was feeling when I called her and asked her for coffee and then the beautiful thing is this thing is 4 years in the making right it will we start right I got her convinced I convinced her to write this book for years in the making it plenty of times I told us to take the backup is that mean she she could you didn't put it up FIU jacket I'm not doing your effing book you can shove it up you know we're so as soon as it got out of you know where we finally wrote it and then bed that time actually the relationship of gotten better and Modern Family sword evolve so we brought Chad and not into and they wrote a chapter 2 in the car and so they have a chapter in The Nasher with a bow on it at the end which is just a beautiful and actually it is his essay that he wrote and so he wrote his invoked you know we didn't convince him to do what he wrote on his own and and he said his parents for what they did so so cool like my dad's first attorney divorce attorney called that so where can people find the book when does a book come out on Amazon for sore mascot books., my man. You know social media everything in the Amazon. Force.com is what we're really trying to do is this isn't about us you know we understand we're humble enough to realize that we're not the only people in this world there doing the saying right but hopefully in the end and what I see today on social media is that there are plenty of people doing this so let's slip let's try to change the conversation while let's try to our way wasn't the only way like a you know what are people who done did it other ways but very evolved approach to it I mean it's not like we understand we're not experts in that not not everybody's going to end up and also reality not everybody's going to end up going to Africa with her ex wife or you don't hang out go to UFC's with her husband fights with her husband and Nadia and Nikki are best friends do they call each other it start off his ex-wife ex-wife evolve to Sister Wives and now they just called you otherwise he's going to end up like that right there different degrees of that as long as you can put the kids first you could put all your nonsense and check your ego and all that other stuff put on your big-boy pants now it's time wow thank you so much Nikki now seems to take over the my car to the bed is it hard to get a word in edgewise with bad never saw him like I didn't like it wide span for.

But ever get to that spot and me both so kudos to those two anybody listening in our in our community that is an exceptional model for peace peaceful agreement after divorce and something during their interview that I wanted to ask all of you about that I thought was kind of interesting you said you are not in touch with any of your ex's or exes Amy he has zero history touch with 95% 95xs couple that I don't talk to you on a regular basis it kills me that I don't talk to them I don't know that's why I wanted to talk to you guys about it and the axes that I I'm close with I probably talked to every week maybe once a month towards you sure there's no issue with a dip positive positive 6 fishy to me all of you not but I'm not married that is so I wanted to see you. Keep in touch with any exes I think because the fact that you're not married means that of course you're not date you're not in a relationship to so who's who's going to get mad at you for talking to a relationship relationship but second of all you updated your Facebook profile how do you say you in a relationship relationship that made you feel like you just didn't want to talk to any of your other exes and is since you haven't been in a relationship that made you not want to talk to any of them was that in essence your heart tell you that you weren't being fulfilled no believe that you and again I'm not married to all the married people can like yell at me but I feel super fulfilled in a relationship and I am like 100% All In everything and I'm super happy but I think the rest of my life is also fulfills me too and I'm not willing to no matter how much I love someone I still does friendships are really important to me and I don't feel bad about that I'm friend like my wife and I are we both were both friends with rx's like on Facebook and stuff and like I don't call him and talk every weekend at all but she doesn't like Dewey the same but we're friends with him on Facebook like it doesn't I'm extremely secure in our relationship I said if we have one of us wanted to be with one of them then we would have been so I have no problem keeping you know I like a friendship like that open I don't think of anything wrong but I bought your wife Saks a plot of land five houses down wine looking like do you have any I don't think so I don't know where they are missing well maybe people can email us men at iHeartRadio cuz I'm so curious about this so especially when I'm having a hard time in a relationship I really do lean on those axes for advice and a lot of people are like about that maybe that's why you always call me and you're like Brooks is going on in your life giving you 10 different worlds and a show but I just wanted to say I think those are the conversations you need to be having with your current boyfriend boom calling other your 10 x's and asking their advice on what you should say to your current boyfriend you need to have the conversation directly with that person and that's the route you need to call me I'll tell you what to say that's also an option I don't like I suggest I do understand and this is just me this isn't saying this is right or wrong and I'm not giving advice to anybody but myself I don't feel like having that be a current part of my life anymore while I'm married to my wife I don't see value in it that's just me and that's and she's not requested that she hasn't said you can't talk to anybody that's just me personally I think it's interesting conversation it but you do have female friends I have female friends that's actually one thing that I love about being married is that my friendships with with females has grown immensely because sometimes I would be friends with a girl and she would think that I was interested in her and it would get awkward or something or but now that I'm married everybody knows that I married at love my wife and so my friendships with women with women in my life like friends in my life have Blossom well and I'm sure you could probably be more open to them and having whatever you're talking about you know it already secure in your relationship with your wife yeah and so it makes that relationship more valuable and more open that are women other than me I'm not allowed of course I did not allowed it could be with this man here has been with those dryers over your head stick to box jumps and let the comedy come from us okay Brooks where was the album E I actually as much as I hate to admit I agree with Brooks in the sense that I my ex before my wife that chapter was that chapter and when I met my wife it was I didn't want there to be any potential sign of disrespect by me continuing to speak to someone so as to convey that I'm not all in on this and by the way what also would also comes into play here is how things ended with your ex if it an't if it ended amicably and it was a mutual thing in my x's case it did not end amicably so it was a no-brainer that I was not going to continue a conversation maybe Gavin has an opinion cuz he seems to take my side a lot so I was in love with someone for a year maybe in a little more everyday number one top priority everyday everything but I still talk to my ex who I'm super close with all the time I wasn't attracted to him I wasn't like anything how do you draw traction off like that like a switch interesting question I can only be attracted to one person at a time and when I'm into that one person it's like I don't see anybody else and then when it's when that ends or whatever and it's someone else then it's them and the other day even was like looking at this Someone I used to think was like I was so attracted to him I was like I should be attracted to him again catch me attracted to him again so let me ask you this question very simply why do you need to have contact with your ex's what purpose in your life does that fulfill that saying it's wrong just asking why I mean I have an FYI talk to all the time work stuff friendship advice can I tell you a question what constitutes an ex exactly how much time are you with them for it to be considered legitimate enough to keep in touch with an ex how much time could call years but I want to say like a month maybe you're still in the hot seat get that Mike back so his question is very valid like what constitutes an X how much time do you have to date and then how much time apart I don't like true acts of you're saying that's my ex girlfriend or boyfriend I think that the definitely has to be one year you know you 6 months you could do that also but then it's like six months isn't you know it's your acts but not an ex ex four months maybe 8 if you're not hitting any real holidays coming tonight and I always counted it if we just brushed our hands against each other that wasn't Gary Hart on okay I can't answer your question you guys are mean I have a hard time if someone comes into my life and they're important whatever that means they're important in some way letting that go I almost cannot do it we'll see I think you're a very loyal person they was a very loyal person friendship and all that so I I understand what you're saying you're you know you don't just like have a bunch of friends that you're not loyal to so when you have an ex I understand you wanting to keep them in your life because they're still important to you just because you've moved on whether it be at you being attracted to them or whatever emotionally or physically I can see why you still want them in your life and go is just have you have has your current or past boyfriends ever brought that up and say I think it's a little weird to me that you're talking to that guy that you dated for six months never have any of the ex contacting them and said I'm all the way out song by you're dating somebody cuz I still have feelings for my ex's new girlfriend or something. Maybe they're married and their spouses like why is this still contact is you ever get an email there was like hey stop talking to my boyfriend now never said don't come to the pediatrician anymore this is real friend how much like truly how much choice questions truly how much you do talk to your exes or do you keep that from it I don't keep anything from like if I'm dating someone I don't keep anything I might not like volunteer so much has it I can be a little bit of like too much too fast you know what I mean so I try to like chill a little nice to meet you. I love you but they're not an issue so you won't come home until like I talk to Ricky Danny and Bobbie today and they all said that I was writing are you can I ask you this question this is serious question to believe that in your life you have enough space for all of these people to have a you really do have to have to have a love of your life and then 10 even just call at 5 but 10 I believe in my life I only have a certain amount of space actually respect that but totally disagree with it because that's like saying Dimitri only has love for three kids he has four and he loves them all the same your heart just like rose that's how you make room space and the love that you have space for more PP of a capacity to handle more people in your life and be engaged in those a relationship then I do have somebody that makes an impact or they are important and I lose them that hole is sober. Is it do you feel like you failed you didn't though sometimes it sometimes things are just single sore like they're serving for a. Of time and then you move on to another. you want a pet buddy Gavin's got a dog named Buddy and a candlelit like like Idol get better but yeah it's it's like guts me I actually admire that quality in you because I feel like cuz I feel like there's things that happen for a reason and the even if like for example so let's say I'm in love with somebody and then it changes it doesn't work out how I originally wanted it I'll do everything I can because I still think that person came to me for a reason so even if it's like okay I have to like I hate this world but like pivot the relationship to being just friends or the person is more important to me than what I wanted from it also believe in just letting go no like just like sometimes it needs to be a mindset I think one one thing Amy like do you ever feel like you're investing too much in yourself too quickly too early in in any relationship me like I know you love to have all these pulling your live whether it's whether it's physical or and it there's an attraction or not an attraction but like you're so far invested into Brooks's point I think it's a good quality that you have but I think it's sometimes you get put into the spider you're putting yourself into the spot where you get hurt you know I think that you invest so much into that person our relationship that whether it will happen after 6 months a year or like a week and a half in time you're walking away from that are pivoting and you're like completely shattered and but I don't think she has to change that because that's where have the hurt that's that's that's all she has Ghost Adventures eventually she will give because look if she dialed that back how much she gives to people then she may miss the person that's the correct person to receive that she say I got a not give so much and some guy they really need that much or wants that much will be like oh I'll shoot you know it is not going to connect there I guess what I'm saying also is like treading lightly into a relationship you know and not just jumping full bore into it it's not her personality type you know I mean we're pretty close but she's very direct when you asked to take a shower with me dude I don't remember what it was about about to just talk about I know I want to talk about Rick and Gap in the shower but I think about Gavin a lot because I think that Gavin because you're has his music he has that outlet and that connection with that toast sometimes I think that people really crave that and I feel jealous of Gavin because he has that that passion in that connection in that dress is him up where is like sometimes I'm looking for that with someone else I loved it Hotel California that's how I got to Memphis yeah let's Go karaoke with a rockstar that's why we just play hockey while riding get out of your system for a me that is so much less than the likelihood of Gavin doing it so I'm basically saying Kevin Canadian hear us cry after everybody all the time and it's like it's so rare it's so rare when I have that connection and I think that's why I like hold on to it in your but you're now considered an ex and she will keep in touch with you I'd like to hear what our lives there's think on this what does lights and yes it is email cuz I'm I'm on the other side I'm like okay that was a chapter of my life it's served me at got me to where I am now moving on you know you still have I love that you're like that because I am literally the opposite it's like there's a reason for this I got to fix this I got to fix this what I do what can I do to think in two months I can fix this maybe in six months in a year do you think it may be by here like does anybody ever get the feeling that if this podcast ever ends Brooks will never talk to any
