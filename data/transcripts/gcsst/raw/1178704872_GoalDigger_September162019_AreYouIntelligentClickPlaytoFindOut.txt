Ochiko I am so excited I feel like as I've been watching you as your unfolding in this kind of new Evolution to go I am like in the front row seat with my chin on this day bring it on and so welcome to the show you are going to blow your mind today quite literally and I'm so excited you're here I'm excited to be here dinner thank you guys so much for the invitation the welcome we were already know the one and only TECO sell tinkle 1st is this eclectic woman who I don't know him like I feel like I'm a patchwork of life I feel like you know people say their stories I feel like there's so many chapters and I try to embrace all of them to become to go so my current chapter like marriage of a tuba 14 years in December I have two babies with their babies to me my dial be and then my son is 10 the one boy one girl I get to love them equally and have a favorite of both I tell them you're my favorite. So I love that and I currently Trane Corporation organizations and team leaders on emotional intelligence really big on a really big on human behavior actually in so I study human behavior I'm in Trend in my interpreter journey and transitions from whatever my focus is gnat season and so right now emotional intelligence which is really not a new phenomenon but it's very interesting start trending and attention to and so that's what I teach and train on I love that when Trends friends and you're like big eyebrows only waited 30 years for eyebrows to be blessed about my bald head Jenna it's like I've been doing this since I was 18 on 43 now but when I see people like bought hair don't care short hair don't they're like yes by the emotional intelligence is because I feel like we're on the cusp of this for a lot of this this is kind of music is an interstate I can I tell you what if not I can still know this love starting with the first because I think people have in their mind I believe with information so literally at our fingertips ready made up their mind if they know something or everything so I'm always like what is it not start with that so when emotional intelligence is not it's not that excuse to be emotional open air quotes emotional beings it's just whatever you feel what I feel inside get to stay at I get to feeling and you have to accept it it's not an excuse for being emotional and it's and it's a way to suppress emotions because I hear that to where people think it's the way to class change what you're feeling faint a dream oceans and I'm using those words interchangeably for now but hopefully I get an opportunity to tell you what's the difference yet we are able to First identified by our own emotions appropriately that's the key there is there are we identify and them appropriately and then are we able to see the emotions and other people can stand that's really care about emotional intelligence so it's not just about understanding what I'm feeling in real time in real life it's about can I see what that other person is possibly feeling too and can I label it correctly and then is taking both of those things and determining how you're going to respond and the goal is for that response to be beneficial to whatever the outcome in wow and so I don't know that it's up its really I know it sounds really deep at some point but another way of simpler way maybe look at it and say it's how I connect emotionally to experiences and encounters that are happening around me so it's how I'm connecting Brothers to the people to the experience to the opportunity to happen to me it's how my connecting emotionally the love that okay so let's dive into the difference between emotions and feelings cuz I feel like this is important and I want to understand it better to yes I love that is interesting because the little back story about how I ended up buying the Brandy and strategy for teens and I've worked with over 200 entrepreneur I'm building in Frandor strategy their stories and when I recognized they really were trying to do is fix what they were feeling and so but when it came to Big teams I found a huge problem that they wanted in results really care about the good work about the validation and not the good product and I just kind of sick of seeing that I'm like I don't think these people get that behind all this good stuff are human and there's something that makes humans work there's something that connects all of us and if you look up the definition of humanity you're essentially see that's what connects with all this really how we feel how we asked how we respond on temperament and our emotion and so that's how I even landed into a guy to do something different than just coming up with these in results when focusing on the actual people that drive the results when it's Works in life and his marriage and I'm as a wife I'm alive but hey there some women who aren't Americans best story at the end there's a human that has to drive it and so and we're made up of human I mean of emotions and feelings excuse me so we're made up of humans humans are made up of emotion and feeling and so the important things to know how do they different so that's where we of course will talk about amazing bunch of your pockets and I love that they feel like teaching moment they really do feel like someone sitting in on Tycho you are a wealth of knowledge and inspiration but like this something but like for a lot of us it's something that we haven't necessarily considered in the development of Brands businesses now it's like wow but you're turning light bulbs and so it's literally thinking about try this over to talk about emotions and feelings right there is nothing we do that's disconnected from any motion and we're going to talk about some of those emotions which makes it even more pointed where we can actually drive home the point so let's just talk about the difference between them for feeling a feeling is really your belief about something so if I say the song about the feeling of love I think Love Is in the Air will you love if I tell you I feel that love exists for everyone I'm actually telling you my belief about love I'm saying I believe in love I believe Love is Real I believe love can you know it exists I believe that love can be attained can be found so every time we said I feel I'm also giving you what I believe you about that which means it comes from almost like a learned a better way to say yes feelings are more of a learned behavior so if anybody is riding and it's easy to see it this way to feelings we learn cuz we learn beliefs we might learn about love based on what we saw growing up and the crazy thing about that is always say we either gravitator deviate from what we see so whatever you've earned it doesn't mean you're going to mimic what you learn you going to make your own belief based off what you've learned so if you saw a loving relationship between your parents you might say that's exactly what I want if you grew up stay like me I grew up in a single-parent home and there was no father around I still knew that's what I wanted because I'm as far as a loving relationship because I didn't have it does that make sense I deviated for what I experienced but I learned my belief based off of what I saw so because I didn't see if I don't tell my mom struggling trying to keep up with three kids and it's crazy cuz we all have three last name so go figure in my mind I'm thinking I don't want any of the right side of my belief about love my feelings about love based off of what I felt I think that's just like this side bar that's important. When I say that you develop you use when you feeling you learn based off of what you've experienced no feelings are these thing that we learn is based off of a training at the example I love is like right now we have so many women never had to do women Run for the office of President and some of us have feelings behind it good or bad, very strong feelings about should a woman be in leadership that tells me what my belief is about women in leadership what do I really believe should be happening I believe women can take on that role do I believe women could be so focused to drive a whole country right and so that tells me what I believe now that's where it's separate from emotions because emotions I was at watch this using when I teach the Bible and now watch this eBay right what is an Emulsion is an instinctual response to the feeling so is usually in the reason it's instinctual here's the here's where we all become like scientists really quick okay then stinks you I mean biological it's a biological response to what we feel and so think of us about the last time you were angry he probably got hot you probably started sweating me I probably started screaming in my head I don't have hair to absorb in the moment you might find yourself shaking because anger is a biological response and everything about our emotions of the same way if you're frightened how your training home Triton Jenna might look exactly the same physically except we're two different women from two different backgrounds you might be my sister from another mister butt going to express that emotion about anger and fear and happiness the same really quick. A basic emotions there's like four basic emotions and that those are happiness sadness fear and anger and from there we have all these other ones that look like anxiety depression can be any motion we have so many and yet you're here compassion excitement greased brene Brown does a really good job and going to add that to something for your followers for all the gold diggers but she has a good list of all these emotions are happiness sadness fear and anger who loves that because emotions or feelings so you should have these beliefs about something and then it dries you're actually motion behind it so you're feeling about this is that make you angry or using our love example really quick if you think about how we say you know the love and emotion might be if I'm scared of love so let's go with someone who's afraid of love that I might get nervous if someone flirts with me I might get angry when I see the see all these married couples active love is in Dolby Altavista rainbow right but if I believe in love everytime I probably believe in love right until your emotions show up based off your belief thinking now that you guys are breaking this down in like I have been exploring emotional intelligence so much with my daughter as she starting to put connections together of what you know stranger danger or like going to the Dieter and so like at the doctor the other day and she had to get shot and the doctor was like well next time she comes she's going to be afraid of me I don't want her to be the feeling either she attributes the doctor to a positive or A negative will drive the emotion correct OK Google right and it with that example soap and it depends because now that you're her mom so there's a such thing as I should say there's a such thing I'm creating emotional intelligent parents and raising no intelligent children I am first in line for this because what happens if it's yes so she sees you really so I call my doctor my children's on my first name baby when they see her she said they see her almost as part of her care system that is a parent but as her care system is here for she's there to give you all the candy you know Grandma's Here for she's here to give you more Kitty relationship cheat I know we're going to hopefully talk about the difference between the relationships euthanize with other people and I'm so sorry she's ready to receive I love that nervous than dangerous is the. I feel like I've been exploring this in so many ways cuz I'm like how do I want to teach her and lead her and I don't want to invoke fear on traveling or anything like that you know it. my parents were kind of making their children afraid of something and I think maybe I over-analyze all of this but I I just feel like man you're in my head right now so let's talk about between EQ and IQ cuz that sounds like gibberish to me right now don't you and I was really actually easy to understand you. You measures quantitative so you think about it smells much as your cognitive intelligence in Majora's Mask Hills memory skills analytical abilities like it's not it's very can you do this in right like are you good at math are you not at work I literally was a school teacher third grade fifth grade and algebra pre-algebra or algebra right so that's something that's all most difficult to make people change naturally okay so I Cube measures your natural ability at those kinds of things measurable thinks it Q is a measures in a nutshell how you'd show up as a person it's how we show up at these humans remember I mentioned like human humanity and how we show up as human ability to recognize our own emotions and in the emotions of others and so one measures who we are and how we show up in the other measures are smart. If you want to really funny way to look at this you can be really smart and still be a complete and IQ you can be extremely intelligent when it comes to books NB the worst person as a friend or as a communicator or as a spouse or as a parent and we don't want that but the good thing about that is what is fluid and laughing motional intelligence EQ is fluid so it could be taught you can practice to get better where I killed one of those things is almost as if I think of something and I don't don't make that thing 55% genetic 65 to 85% genetic change so it's fluid so even if you are that's a difference between the different things in the funny thing is he has five areas that it measures but I'm going to also include this in that little fun goodie bag I want to kiss your people what is how we see ourselves this is really good and there's a big difference there because how I see myself might not be how I express myself so I might be really shy even know when I'm home I know I have this main categories and then it's how we interact in our relationships and I could be with co-workers it could be with your parents with your child your daughter it's how we in our relationships and invented the fourth one is how we make decisions and then the last one watch that this how we measure stress I like this the way we navigate stress is so important to emotional intelligence and stress could be from the cashier taking forever to ring up your groceries two at work your boss dumping heaves of work on you and knowing that you don't have that kind of time so that's what that numbs and if you think about it or we show up emotionally to those things probably matters like how am I going to respond to my boss clothing bag when you measure you know what I think when as you're saying This and like being an entrepreneur test every one of those almost daily like if we're really digging and like it would be so interesting maybe I'll challenge myself and my listeners if you wrote down those five things and every day you just raided yourself from A1 to A5 of how you're showing up I feel like I could really interesting and as you are explaining them I was like really well in this area and season where I have really been awful get out even more than that we're going to be like here's the really good thing about understanding emotional intelligence and I know when I went to my certification art director she drill this morning so and it's true, my research you're not trying to be good at one of them which one you really really strong about and you use that to balance so like if you are not a different area you do know that stressed because they Frances I am very are right and so my decision-making can go away from 0 to 100 XP very plan to bury him if I know that I need to put people around me who are high in decision-making all we want kind people all the time which the one thing that I train companies on and leaders on is if you want people to be aesthetic regardless because that means I can place myself in your shoes but you don't have to be good at all of them because we kill ourselves like a word that's like asking for a perfect person and I'm going to do this for you. I want to do the test I am not your ID I just want it I think it's 120 138th on what is 9 okay no I'm really good at don't think I'll ever be a social I feel great when they do not experience I love this and I think it would so I mean you're so right and as I'm looking at my business now I'm like damn I wish I knew more about this before because especially as your business grows in may be used for hiring a team is like you said like understanding like this and I need people that will either challenge me or support me in this area so help me with this let's say somebody comes up to you now it's Chico you know I'm an entrepreneur and I might kind of just getting started and I don't really see how emotional intelligence plays a role in My Success what would you say okay when I get to work place it was connected to leadership so it was actually based on that and then from there and started being able to be applied research started applying it to other elements insurance as other roles we play right and so when it comes to your actual understanding emotional intelligence if you remember that it's how you show up it's a game-changer let's just take one for self-expression very opinionated tico in this to say oh yes and now you might have even if I have a response already I have to tell myself to Eco you can't respond right now let them get it out let them have it don't even when I get to respond today so I'm at the state like knowing your strengths of who you are and it's showing up as an entrepreneur even for yourself now that's the good part even for yourself because guess what I know you know this entrepreneur sometimes we stand so you know you're a good planner guess what you'll do forever plan an idea and you'll never come away from the planning part right that's what that might be saying it might be staying at the planning part of you is really really good at decision-making or really really good as Stress Management cuz you can sit and plan and never get free that you can take a coffee break or a wine break I don't know what your free gift new and you can do that at it and so it makes you really great at that you might also be withdrawn with the self-expression because like this is new and I know I'm supposed to be doing this as a business but I have a great great friend right now who she's like tickle when it comes to selling which we all think you're right. How are you and she know she's supposed to be but she's trying to understand how a mic to be an introvert which isn't that you can't cut introvert that's why we have to try to balance how I think she would be like our perfect avatar for talking about how do you navigate this with you no emotion telling you show up to other people room and she'll never mention this is what I do because of the self-expression component and so but then it would happens if you started having them do those layers and uncover what is it about expression of what is it in there and that's keeping me from saying okay I don't have to be the social person and take these people home and invite them to my party I just need to be able to talk about who I am in school that is good I am loving this conversation with Tycho so just a minute but first I want to thank you for supporting this episode and the show pretty much the beginning for 2 months of unlimited course access for free had to skillshare.com and power of lifelong Learning Community for creators with thousands of your creativity and your career whether you're looking to discover a new passion start a photography side hustle you professional skills so that you can start that dream business maybe it's a social media management business you've been thinking about her is there to keep you learning and reaching those goals is a great way to make your downtime productive think that show your binging press start on a video course on graphic design or doodling for iPads like I did and bring your business to the next level join me and the millions of other students already learned skill share with this special just for you get two months of skillshare free that's right skillshare is giving gold digger listeners two months of unlimited access to thousands of classes for free to sign up had to skillshare.com schooldigger in the number to again had to skillshare.com Gold Digger to to start your two months now thank you to ship station for supporting the show today you can try shipstation free for 60 days just had to shipstation.com music do you want to shop and you're sending them to customers all over the place shipstation is a shop owners easiest quickest and most efficient shipping best friend no matter where you're selling Amazon at sea or from your own website station brings all of your orders into one place then you can compare shipping options between major carriers like USPS UPS FedEx Amazon and then you can choose whatever makes the most sense for you your product in your customers shipstation offers big discounts on shipping to so you don't have to be a massive company shipping truck loads of product every day you can get those same discounts for shipstation so you know you're getting the best deal don't let the shipping time or cost be the robot that keeps our customers from hitting that submit order button try shipstation free for 60 days can you use a promo code gold digger you don't have to hand over your credit card info you can start your free trial right now just visit shipstation.com click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in Gold Digger that shipstation.com then enter the promo code shipstation make ship happen I have a selfish question I like digging into this and more than I'm questioning and you can be like please be brutally honest with me I have always prided myself in the recent years as my business has grown in scaled I genuinely believe that I am not very emotional when it comes to business and I feel like that has been a coping mechanism in a sent to help me to make better decisions and I think to it as women and not not just because we're females as women emotional beings and if I were to approach my business from a state of emotion all the time of the exhausting to me and so as you're talking about this I'm like is this a good thing. Like when I I'm a numbers person so if I can see numbers that gives me Clarity instead of emotions which I think can be like all over the place what would you say to somebody that says that pulling yourself or like is that legit I don't know I'm so glad that's how you ended up everybody's emotional only focus on a certain type of emotion emotion emotion or meet the answer about people who was shot we think that people who are able to just see black and white infant eye to an emotion emotion emotion emotion a person who says no I don't need you at your best type of emotions the way you express it is different so your emotion is I need to stay focused so I'm going to be driven because you're probably very driven so they are driven and let you know how it steamer and wanting to 16 which are also attribute to describe you on the shore here is your way that's how you emote if that means I'm not going to get invested with this from a heart standpoint I'm not going to put so many feeling otherwise you probably remove a lot of the feelings down to what I believe I'm just more focused on getting it done and you just shout connected what's happening because you just like shattered some some ceilings in my world in a good way to be able to see yourself what happens when we who we really are and I will say this with this news I hope I don't get in trouble. Hope your next guess is not about self-care behavior is using it to say okay well you know what I no longer and put myself in those situations if your energies look right right Mike what is that energy has happened to follow you in every situation maybe you need to cut yourself off from you it's not the people and it's not self care is just putting this bandaid on what you're hiding right for you is I think we end up beating ourselves up and so if your way is to Simply say you know what I have to get this done in this is how I get their cool that's how you should it doesn't find most people don't see them okay she's a jerk on top of vision making and her great Stress Management cuz that's where you would buy probably as long as they're not then it's going to be that way but somebody at the front to do the nice work equals I can have a creative mind that I'm like wait but with that creativity they're asking strategy in lineup to beat yourself up one thing people talk to you is they're not honest enough with other people I don't say hey I'm a straight shooter using every interview every conversation I had with anyone I was telling my filter is broke and I enjoy that but I always say my filters before I could have come to say that like that you better text blood in the people around you can appreciate how you get down that comes from like self-awareness and just being honest about that but you did say something that I want to ask about is you talked about strengthening different aspects like are the things that you can do to strengthen the way that you're showing up based on emotion there is it really I just told that there are exercises now I'm not into cornea exercises it's okay I will use my husband as an example so one of the things we need to talk about it be getting my husband looks like he doesn't look like as a CFO of for the company he works for he's over at USC and Texas school of medicine but he shows up in his powerful position all the time at our job because he said they have us holding hands in the matter holding hands outside the circle the women holding hands I think a lot of our work has to be introspective about looking for the greatest inspiration and tools are simple to we can do for ourselves to the one interest active homework assignment I enjoy giving is to jot down so whatever it let's go back to the five core emotions right in the forecourt emotionary happiness anger and fear when is it that you recognize you want to fix her you want to work on and I hate the word fix but for better and for lack of a better word right now begin to fear right down the times not that you're fearful but that you feel rules in Bowdon are you still most at that you're ready come to fear is still in coffee right and so I would say jot down all the times you remember feeling confident and put those around you that made that possible so when I say what was around you was that a team of people was that your parents was a childhood because your parents believed in you was going to bring book you read was it at work because you're you know employees are your team recognized you as an entrepreneur is it because you're following day Empower you and then I would say because it's really easy to get into a social media is everything okay I'm everything cuz I have all these people liking me but when I come home and there's a problem with that so I would say jot down the time that you said that that that you felt the opposite of fear and then spend some time on a night like an itemized list of when you feel fearful that sounds like when you feel fear frosted fear and then go to those are so keen on what can I do to challenge I can guarantee you going to find a trend in all the times are still here upon me it might be for somebody every time I think someone's looking it might be every time I'm starting something new so depending on what that trim looks like I would say start looking into what can I do differently then I might look like getting yourself in a group where there is more empowerment happening because you don't you see that every time you're fearful is because you feel a lack of support until we're like a gold digger you feel empowered because we do need that if you feel fearful because it always requires you to take this huge leap of the unknown right I also call it like this huge leap of faith if it requires you to take this humongous sleep then maybe have to tell you some okay I'm going to do something really big and every week it when I say big in odd that could be something like I'm going to go in the grocery store I'm going to introduce myself to three strangers really practicing how to get outside of what it's your cuz if you're if you know you're supposed to be a public speaker right but you do better behind your computer then to me a good way is not go introduce yourself to strangers by the time you get all their crazy reactions you're ready for the stage I love that I love that I mean I feel like emotional intelligence does take a lot of self-awareness like we can't keep trying to fool ourselves or like hide from it like this is who we are and there's no apologies necessary the funny thing that what you just said about the know when you're in our self-respect is really enough watching that test really is helpful because it does help you to COK about yourself and the other part about knowing who you are it's really knowing what your Hang-Ups are so the first easy it doesn't really make you have to be hard on yourself and I think it's feeding our, let's talk about this let's go back to fix that I think really well and your people who say I don't watch the news cuz it's so defensive on contact with the homeless or they don't stay by Alan tear in places that are so easy so I volunteer my reading at the library at the kids school cuz it Doesn't pull on you know any motional string if you don't know really sit and see what other people's worlds experience for a moment with their experience in because here's a good thing when you say OK I don't watch the news because it's too depressing it's only the person in that moment when your watch it cuz you get to return to your realize I feel the more we feed our Consciousness the more we're able to actually check our emotion the easier it is for me to be a little bit more patient with the person who and this is no slight towards anybody but if you see someone who's about saying my age range in their forties working as a sales clerk in a store chances are they're not doing it because he this was my goal in life so if I'm really aware of what people may be going through in a slow me down and it and that's how I train my emotions so from me I try to stay connected to what other people may be experiencing Uber driver for my twelve-year-old like it might sound really full full and you know fluffy if you think like I have my check so I feel like seeing our conscious with the things that make us uncomfortable is how we'll work 100% agree and I feel like that discomfort is necessary for growth and entitlement hazards do you know Americans were just really into and we believe everything we work hard for the things I'm not saying that I have an opportunity to that was very nice don't deserve what I work for what I'm saying is other people deserve the same opportunity that I like I really believe that since you like that I would tell you this real quick if your daughter baby girl she's the oldest my son is a little different and they don't ask for much that like girls do right you are a girl one so you know we want everything going to Target and so one day she was walking around acting kind of entitle her brother asked her for some other side know that the wall doesn't rotate around her and I said no to teach her that the world around her when it's time for her to evolve yeah so I feel like we have to decrease what we want but to increase with other people can have a girl that's it that's it right there send that to me and I you check your emotional intelligence am I always showing up to increase somebody else's bottom line am I finishing their day right and I'm making them feel more special than before they said hello to me when I say something and I are might regret saying this but I want to say I feel like you just unpacked privilege in a perfect way right that's exactly what privilege is White Privilege black privilege in kind of privileges that we know white privilege is just probably but most people don't see what I told us she was so that's all we're saying and privilege is directly tied to our emotional intelligence it's directly tied to see myself for who I am how do I show up do I express myself with a way that shows that other person they're the same as me and do I interact which is a social component and then that helps make my decision that's not right because I tell you something we don't make a decision was made it to say yeah yeah we've made a choice when we don't stand up for the things we know we made a choice and then how does that stress cuz sometimes when the stress hit okay I'm out of here this is too much I don't even deal nevermind I just want to do that I'll stay at this level yeah yeah the way that you just described all of that in a sense and so much of it ties back to emotions and feelings. How we feel and experience I didn't understand privilege for a very long time and I feel like a lot of white women take offense to that terminology because they think that the word privilege insinuates that they haven't worked hard and the way that you just go used to struggle to like understand that you just explained it really broke it all down no matter what situation are background or anything like it's not that you didn't work to get what you have but it's at other people aren't given that same opportunity to do the same and that's really it really isn't what you said that because that's key is Sookie to most of what we don't understand is that no one saying lesson that's why I gave you the scenario I use with my daughter right now but I need to show up when you give it that same love you and so was just making sure that other people have the same opportunity that we don't see ours it's okay I'm entitled everything you get emotion but so does the other person is not taking away their opportunity at the same hard work and that's just what it is so good to minutes for your last answer. Like I mean I would give you an hour I mean approach social media from a place of understanding of emotional intelligence and how that can impact it for the purposes one I've been together because I think there'd be true if you don't have anything so in other words searching for something to me is not necessarily emotionally intelligent it's full of self and emotional intelligent people aren't self-absorbed to be really strong in our emotions we have to remove ourselves from just wanting attention so I say approach social media from an authentic place and maybe it's not a place for you so I will say know that you have a platform every world just might not be social media but the idea that we feed into everyone should have a platform like I'm really not concerned with my following in my numbers I just I'm just not I don't do any promoting for them like whatever happens happens I figure it just has to be my authentic smell and you show up in that way I feel like I told you I got goosebumps just reading a two-sentence caption which we all know I am not short-winded I was like dad likes everything I was like dang it yes yes haven't had it find you connect so I am going to put together a digital goodie bag for the gold diggers and so they can find that at it's going to be TECO Les Johnson s t i e k o n e j o n n.com backsplash good love it is a goodie bag and then tikona john.com is where my work is I'm on social media Saccone John and then I have this new thing that's a social club.
