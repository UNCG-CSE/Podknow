are you out recording or we could testing one two three testing testing we have something special for you all today it's not a typical to line episode it's a conversation with one of our favorite storytellers you might have heard of him he's mean dozens of historical documentaries over the years about everything from the Civil War to Jazz to cancer to the Vietnam War documentary about country music and I have to be honest I don't really care about country music in fact I don't like it growing up I Associated country music with artists like Toby Keith who's songs were nope recipe patriotic and really weren't for someone like me but when I heard Ken Burns was making a documentary about country music I was like okay and let's see what is about and that my friends is makes Ken Burns so good at what he does he take something that you think you have zero interest in and makes it interesting which is what we try to do every week on this show so we were super excited to sit down with him and talked about his approach to storytelling why history matters and Country Music. Conversation when we come back hi this is a Tom on from East Brunswick New Jersey and you're listening to through mine from NPR support for this podcast in the following message come from Tito's Handmade Vodka born and bred in Austin Texas the live music capital of the world musics just kind of part of our DNA says Tito Beveridge founder and master distiller of Tito's Handmade Vodka recipes videos and more visit them at Tito's vodka. Com 80-proof Tito's Handmade Vodka fifth generation Incorporated distilled and bottled in Austin Texas crafted to be savored responsibly I can't believe that summer is basically over time and you know what that means the 2020 presidential race is only going. It's a good thing we spent all summer sitting down with the Democratic candidates for president hello it is great to be with you thanks for having me I'm delighted to be here or close your pretty sure to check out the NPR politics podcast feed for exclusive interviews with all the candidates on the debate stage play so naturally the first question we had for Ken Burns was why country music and why now that came out in 2001 you know what I do rock and roll and and and I am a child of rock and roll and R&B that was my music and yet when the country music idea came friend of mine said about country music in it been mentally on some list but it just sorta entered in my heart it was like this hole hearted yes whatever it was we were thinking about doing next together that's disappeared in for the next eight years we really plowed towards this I knew some stuff my granddaddy and my daddy and I'm saying these songs but I knew that it was connected to All American music that what we tend to do in everything particularly now where there seems to be a tsunami of information breaking over us is that just out of desperation we in Silo everything into its own category but when you listen to country music and you learn a little bit about it you find out from the very beginning it was never one thing the Big Bang took place in the summer of 1927 in Bristol Tennessee when Ralph peer and entrepreneur recorded in almost succeeding sessions The Carter family and Jimmie Rodgers once I had a sweetheart so you have this music that's growing up that then adding all sorts of stuff Western swing cowboy music bluegrass dim the Bakersfield sound cut it more smooth Nashville sound the later and even smoother countrypolitan Sam I mean it defies category like all the other genres any documentary Explorer at least in the beginning the sharing of culture in the Carter family used basically old gospel song tonight will The Circle Be Unbroken the biggest country song may be the most influential ever given that I know what you were going to say when he sees documentary given what happened recently with the Old Town Road I'm sure you're aware of it was Lil Nas X I think what that brought up is for a lot of African Americans vote we have a history in this music to you got. Country music is our music too so it's in every episode of ours and that Dynamic is there and if you made a Mount Rushmore of the top five people The Carter family Jimmie Rodgers Hank Williams Bill Monroe who invented Bluegrass and Johnny Cash all of those 5 had an African-American Mentor took their chops from here and put it way up here so that they deserved a place in the Mount Rushmore so all of a sudden you realize this is not some Back Forty Acres of some hick thing but in fact one manifestation of American music that's going to also manifest itself in the Blues in jazz in folk in rock-a-billy and later Rock and R&B and soul and let's remember it's a complicated story the two main instruments of country music the fiddle which comes from Europe in the British Isles and the banjo which comes from Africa tells you about a dynamic cancel our first episode is called the rub and normally when we think about races coming together in the American South the rub the friction produced is a -1 in this case while the negativity is still there all of the horrors of slavery end of Jim Crow end of segregation end of menstrual see are there but one of the byproducts is extraordinaire like positive which is creating a set of music jazz and blues and country that is America's music the tension at the beginning of country music that produce something great yes but also complicated because you mentioned these Mount Rushmore sort of figures at country music all were inspired borrowed from African-American music and culture can you talk a little bit about that sort of tension how informed the rise of country music I think that tension is surprised no most everywhere in American Life in every subject that we've done and I think no more so than here and that's where creativity takes place not in these sort of perfect moments but in in just a complication of life I don't see this in terms of appropriation because of course African Americans are listening and borrowing from so what you see are people who are a huge variety of mixtures there is a sense to me that we don't know Gus Cannon Johnny Cash's Mentor as well as we know Johnny Cash SI Johnny Cash's full Johnny Cash with to the end of his dying day would tell you the significance of Gus Cannon to who he was and the kind of person you begin same with Elvis there's a lots of argument about Elvis but Elvis knew where it came from you was listening to country music you would listen to gospel black and white just listening to the blues he was listening to everything and he reflected and that's who we are but you can't celebrate a Melting Pot in the other side and then say it's not good to melt there's presumptions in Commerce that people are only listening to this music that are whiter that they're only listening to R&B that are black and this just isn't the case I must mean that would never die when Ray Charles had a chance to have creative control over an album for the first time and released modern sounds in country and western music and it's the great hit was I can't stop loving you mean just phenomenal cross over in the other way that you would imagine you know the culture is going to resist that the culture often will default to the lowest common denominator us against them and what I think art reminds us is that you can neutralize that conflict with something that's he's a little bit bigger than that and good art always does it give me to meet Deford Bailey who's a harmonica player in early African American member of the Grand Ole Opry who's unceremonious lace or kicked out at a moment's or a resurgent Jim Crow and over excuses brought back you have Charlie Pride you have Ray Charles doing this spectacular thing and end throughout our film is Rhiannon giddens who's an African-American woman who is one of the great most driving country sound you'll ever hear and tearing the cover up almost every song she attempts to sing I watched a few weeks ago at the Ryman Auditorium home for decades of the Grand Ole Opry sing Patsy Cline's Crazy and bring three thousand people to their feet and thunder Supply so it's there right in front of us the recipe is there what do you do at the beginning I mean it seems like this was a learning process for spending eight years on it is this something you knew at the outset that there was a deep in Turkish American story at the heart of country music you know it's so easy to back and fill in lie to you I'm looking in all these things for civics reflect us back to us and I don't want to do stuff that I know about and what's so great about country is that it's Elemental three chords and the truth that the song writer Harlan Howard said and that means it doesn't have the elegance and sophistication of say classical music or even jazz what is has a really clear lyrics and very simple music that is telling you Elemental things about human life the joy of birth the sadness at death falling in love trying to stay in love falling out of love being lonely seeking Redemption there's nobody within the sound of my voice that hasn't experienced at least one if not two if not all of those things and what we found as we are working on the film is are developing sense that we were sitting on a kind of a volcano of emotional power and people would come in and they would be you know I love country music I but I had no idea that it was best or I'm not really sure I don't like country music once you get rid of the Deadwood and get the brush out this is extraordinary set of tunes that the series is introducing you to and for those who said I don't like country music they suddenly realized how kind of superficial and blind that might be that good music is good music wherever it is they're bad Jazz yes is there bad Blues yes is there bad Rock oh my God you know so so is there bad country of course but if you can tell the kind of story multi-generational huge Russian novel of a story that we told across 8 episodes in 16 and a half hours you have a chance to see this American Family story that added heart is as America is one of the things that struck me in the film was the number of women who played such a big role in the development of country music this is a surprisingly feminist film from the very beginning Sara Carter and mother Maybelle Carter are two super strong women and their followed by Rose Maddox and Kitty Wells and Patsy Cline of course rattle in so in the mid-60s Loretta Lynn is dealing with themes that nobody in folk has touched nobody in Rock Island Drinkin with Lovin on your mind or any of the you're not woman enough to take my man so what you have is this kind of surprisingly proto-feminist film when that tune comes out don't come home a Drinkin the year that women's Liberation is used and the red is not going to use that term she's not joining any movement and neither are fans but they are imbibing of these fundamental human aspirations I'll be waiting when you came home last night you been out with all the boys I was just stopped and talked about the unspoken thing which is rock and roll every single one of the Beatles their initial impulse was country order of of the songs that the Beatles gave Ringo to sing country songs they're going to make a big star in fact his first big one Act Naturally is a Buck Owens tune which suddenly revitalizing made Buck Owens cool when Bob Dylan fell after these just iconic albums like you don't freewheelin Bob Dylan you know Highway 61 Revisited where does he do he goes to Nashville and he has blond on blond and John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline he's using the Nashville session musician The A Team they were called to get the best sound out ESOP but it's nothing you did nothing to change I mean you just tell me what's not country about the band for about the birds after having explored psychedelica they are going to Nashville to record an album sweetheart of the rodeo what day was you have a Honky Tonk Woman by The Rolling Stones if you're going to put up barriers then you forgotten that everything's on a kind of Continuum and I would suggest because of the Carter family's will The Circle Be Unbroken that is not a linear one its it comes around it's it's full circle how exactly do you boil down the 20th century into a 16-hour documentary Ken Burns tells us when we come back this is

around him but I will Dante from NPR listen And subscribe now alright so after talking about country music for a while the conversation moved to music and Ken Burns films more generally and rum teen who has he probably knows scores through line had a lot of questions I want to ask you out music because I've seen all of your movies and I think they'll be looking like Civil War and Away musical used me and then Vietnam what is your decision making from from the film about how you use Music how much music used in Vietnam I thought Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross the score was incredible unbelievable what was the decision till I get them involved in that and so much different so give him the music is always the same for us even when the two films that it's been about music smooth jazz and country music it's not just background but it's sort of middle-ground and foreground and sometimes I kind of hyperspace is your deconstructing a piece of music we recorder music before we begin at it and we have most of our music in place most people at the exact opposite it has scored which is a mathematical term and they're sitting there to the picture and they want to hit this at this we never do that will cut the picture to the music music is such a powerful foe Pinterest and we might shorten a sentence in order to fit a phrase in music or lengthen it just to fit a phrase in music or just shut up for a second it's hard for us to do because we have written films too and we celebrate that there that we don't think that image of the word are at odds and music is the great reconciler of that so we're recording our music we in in the Civil War I just sat with a person who played on a piano all of these hymns always popular music of the day all this military stuff and I pick maybe 40 tunes and then we went into the studio and recorded each of those two and 40 different ways and so we have all of these choices going in so each subject requires that you want to have a contemporary music that's no different than Vietnam soul in Novac my co-director on Vietnam was watching The Social Network and she went play some music is unbelievable and came back and said we should get them and I was like yes what a great idea so we went to trial in Atticus and they said yes we'd love to do that and they said Tessa they never let us in on the process that this was one of the most satisfying creative things they had working on the stuff and delivered us three hours of material that is mind-blowing and we went to Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble and they took Vietnamese tunes and lullabies and functions at anyone North and South window and Bentham in their unique and completely original fashion and then we go out and we collect 120 pieces of music and the first thing we do is we went to The Beatles and said we can't afford this we need you to help us in this and fight and then we went to Bob Dylan he's fine and we just walked her way through the rest of the hundred and twenty pieces we would have been able to afford 12 had they not said look we understand what you're trying to do and we we promised never to play a piece of music that wasn't out that is to say you couldn't hear it on Armed Forces Radio or you couldn't hear it in your transistor radio on your car radio on the way to a demonstration against the war and that we'd use it honorably and that has to do with the fact that for us music is Central it's not like the afterthought it's not the icing that you hope is going to amplify emotions you hope you hope her there but in fact baked into the process from the beginning music is so powerful I mean we all were talking about today is music and its power Empower history right kind of this is why I'm there because we'd like to say that we're condemned to repeat what we don't remember it just doesn't happen human nature never changes the Ecclesiastes says what has been will be again what has been done will be done again there's nothing new Under the Sun that suggests that human nature doesn't change and so when we think history repeats itself we're only looking at these have you know these Cycles these you know motifs these themes is constantly recurring and then gives the possibility in history to be our best teacher you know Mark Twain said history doesn't repeat itself but it Rhymes and I can't tell you there hasn't been a single film it's almost 40 films I thinks I'm an hour and length of 18 hours in like where I haven't finished the film and looked up and gotten my God it's about the cross and I can't convince anybody that this film was essentially editorially locked before the me-too movement came because you would swear to God in every episode we're like oh there's a nice little reference to never put in any reference to the present in any of the films it's just that everything rhymes but the great tyranny the arrogance of the present is that we somehow think that because we're alive and they're not that we know more than them and we do not we experience everything the way they did and there were conversations 10,000 years ago that were is complex as I hope this is when we come back more on The Art of Storytelling from Ken Burns Gina from Frederick Maryland line from NPR support for this podcast in the following message come from Delta Delta flies to 300 cities around the world that's 300 cities where people in those 300 cities think they're the only ones who know about that one place and 300 cities where people miss someone and one of Delta's other 299 cities Delta isn't flying to 300 cities merely to bring people together but to show that we're not that far apart in the first place Delta keep climbing I'm trying to get a sense of sort of your approach to tell a history and all these stories because it seems like with all of your documentaries you're bringing each other things it's just it's way more complicated then you go in maybe thinking it is you know what's funny I think I've grown as a filmmaker but my very first film for Public Broadcasting is one call Brooklyn Bridge and I was raising money I looked about 12 years old and everybody was turning me down haha this kids trying to sell me the Brooklyn Bridge know and I used to have binders filled with the rejection letters just to remind me that how complicated is particularly in public broadcasting to get anything done but I was writing a letter and I added that I that I was uninterested in Excavating dried dates and facts and events of history that I was interested in an emotional archaeology I wrote that in like 77 when I was trying to raise money or 78 and I don't know of any better way to put it than that that if we want to use history as a weapon then you're only speaking to the choir the only speaking to the converted you can't possibly change Minds the novelist Richard Powers said that the best arguments in the world won't change a single person's mind the only thing that could do that is a good story and a good story I think we'd all agree is the one that has that complication one that has that undertow one that has a thing in the opposite of a thing being true at the same time and our ability to tell each other stories and to remind us that we are obligated as human beings not as Democrats or Republicans are white people or black people or gay or straight people are male or female people or West Coast people are East Coast people are North people are South people but just people is that we're going to have to negotiate these things for our Schultz first and to reconcile the seemingly irreconcilable opposites and when you have the possibility to do that and art and storytelling are all part of the infrastructure of helping us get through that stuff then you have the possibility of of what everybody wants to be what everyone wants to be which is a better person and better for everyone yeah and you said emotional archaeology which is really interesting cuz one of the things we struggle with I think is the balance between story and timeline right like on the one hand on your telling history you want people get a sense of what happened over the course of history but but the iweek I completely agree to that narrative in story is what makes someone it's the only thing she knows her first of all there's lots of things to say first of all Let Me Explain emotional wreck this is not sentimentality this is Nostalgia those are the enemies of good anything the other thing is that quite often we go through our own fashions in historiography you know you drop an atomic bomb after you've murdered 60 million people and I mean I mean the human race does this in the second world war and everything is question and narrative is the first thing to go and then and then and then seems hopelessly bankrupt in an adequate to the situation and so we begin to have Freudian approaches we begin to have Mark sister economic determinist approaches to things we have later on symbolism and semiotic Sandy construction and afrocentrism and all sorts of ways of saying that this is the way in and what we have come back to understand is that a much more informed we would say today woke Heritage allows for all of those possible things I've just watched with great satisfaction that often it was a knee-jerk racism to the work that I had done in the 90s because it didn't fit into an academic definition because it's subscribe to this old bankrupt thing called there that know there are some areas that are bankrupt if you think the top down story of Great Men is only the story of American History then yeah it doesn't work but if you're engaging a bottom-up as well as a top-down you begin to realize that to tell that complicated or you have to bring in all of these other things these are the tools of narrative not the sole new way to do history and so I think we're we come back and I found the academy back to this idea that you kept its narrative and then and then and then we just have to be a little bit more conscious have to be a little bit more expensive and generous got to be a little bit more inclusive if we're going to call it if we're going to do our jobs that we struggle with and that I think you do well is when you're telling a story you mentioned that you've told the story of twentieth-century America however many times it needs time to sort of a slightly different story how do you know what to leave in what to leave out like how you make those choices so that is actually my our job work amassing of vast body of information stuff that's in the script stuff that's in the interview stuff that's in the photographs stuff that's in the footage in the Life cinematography whatever it is it's at least 47 x 50 60 70 times what we're going to end up using and then it's cutting it away the key for us we found his time you know we're not doing these things in a couple of years we doing in them over a decade in the case of Vietnam 10 and 1/2 years or we're doing him in eight years and that's because we want to wrestle with this material we don't want to disqualify something we want to learn we want to throw stuff out our cutting floor is not filled with bad stuff it's filled with really really good stuff if we picked it up and showed you go my God why is that in it yeah we're still hurting about that but it didn't fit that we edit Human Experience down we do nothing is defended if you do what you can do and I imagine that if I worked on civil Civil War now it would be 35 hours right Anna may not be as good a film it was just who I was at that time just struggling and waking up at 4 in the morning which I still do going, and sometimes it hurts so bad that I'll say okay let's put it back and then and then you'll see and then maybe two months later three months later Hugo okay can we take it out you see how that's destabilize as great as that scene is it's now made something an hour later seemed kind of boring and you can watch people look at their watch or ship their their chair is because you just in that moment lost them and I I make really long films this is a huge demand on our audience in a time when people are supposed to be butterflies flitting and we go now we need you to stay for 10 episodes in 18 hours of Vietnam or eight episodes in 6 and 1/2 hours but then I'm obligated to make sure that if you sat down there going to be no interruptions for 2 hours and that it's my obligation that if you bring your attention I will not squander that great gift that you've given me and if they're curious we want to reward that attention and that that's a compact of Storytelling wow thank you so much for this and we really appreciate it's my it's been my pleasure that's Ken Burns
