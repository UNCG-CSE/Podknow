Hi I did love that I was so Brett Merriman was like you said he was like you need to do I was wondering I can actually wear a lie like think of it I don't know. And then he literally wrote the message he was absolutely certain on that they were going to do something that you guys sent and I think Kelly and I are probably on the same wavelength on a lot of things but just a warm-up just so we can get to know you you know I want the audience to feel like they know you as well as they know me some and ask you a question to warm up after everybody does. I'm so how did you lose your virginity oh my God OK I was like don't tell my mom I was 16 I drove my car red Mustang convertible like don't be jealous are you shiting me can you tell me that it's cool and some people tell me that it's trashy like there's this there's a 50-50 people think Mustangs or white trash or that they're called I were like a basic bitch so I looked sexy learner's permit red convertible drove to my friend's house do you sneak out or with my parents are there in 10 us3 play on via text message on a LG VX 3100 shout out to the flip phone I don't even know what that is and I know you don't cuz you're like the LG Family flip phone LG's are I would take an LG tomorrow I have to take it back I had several LG but so I had that flip-phone like discuss sex I said he was very much like a blow job is just so he was under the assumption that I was getting in my car. Just come get the hollow child blowjob I'm done with this like I'm done with this like I don't the song and dance I want to put a lot of pressure on it I could give a fuck about my virginity I just want to like toffee Planet way to look at it and so that's what I did and then I went over and I was fine it was like missionary and not great but a lot of me talking like 2 minutes so probably like probably like 5 I would say if I guess I'll do the Solid 5 and then and then years later we hooked up again and it was way better objectively horrifying I need to get this out of the way that's how I feel a lot of it depends actually I should take that was about to say I don't really feel a lot of emotion Santa Maria quetta too early I never really dead I never really did and then once I did then it was like oh fuck this sucks so now I no longer me out to attach a motion by a diaper for much better in my life in general when I don't have a motion with sex or not if you're having a one-night stand and like I got this on the coolest stuff world I feel fine I don't even think about you were cool with me. There's like a beginning middle and end today I had a guy the first time a guy like literally made prolonged eye contact with me I was like you need to guess not. I'm so uncomfortable I need you to look at me like I love her soul kiss stop it going to like a look at my fucking soul like look in my nothing scares me like that you want me to want to be I want to be scared but not in like a soul want to be like in my going to die right now will also give me time to lay emotionally like I can't do it and then later I can't believe that it was like you're dipping your toe back into a motion that's how I like to see it possible to have like emotion on everything except for being able to do with it a relationship don't know I don't know it's like it's very I feel like the cuz obviously like already just like me to have sex you have sex with people whatever and if you if you go into it knowing I think than this is something that I do people that purpose I said specifically know that I can never be in a relationship with whether it's like I do the same with the girlfriend it's like somebody who's a best friend to like a guy I used to date or anything along those lines are used to date one of my friends like she'll. Those are yes I know that I know them and I will never ever date them it's like yeah let's hook up because those the people I'm a sucker for the way secrets of people you would only hook up with if you got stuck on an elevator together cuz you know it's like so wrong you can't do it I feel like probably yeah maybe I don't know she like elevators like Alvin is fine I wouldn't specific elevator I when I think we have more of that I think like people that are at my apartment and nobody knows where I live like she like that I need to like make some food after like I need to be for you some wine that only I like yeah exactly the situation might be a little a little outside of my control I always feel like I like the elevator the idea of the old I don't think I could do the elevator right I like the idea of it because it's what we were stuck on an elevator for an hour what else were we supposed to do you like the only people who would know I should have done it at the bar if you would like it right in this vicinity it's at my desk don't know I know that's like really special I was actually happy belated birthday I saw I saw how lovely was it was it wonderful you're 23. Right no one likes me how to do it like they cry but I cried so far this year so it's kind of like damn that ruined the age I cried about my recently I was like I'm 28 and 1/2 and I and I added up you like grown but you're not there a little ground but I'm not quite as Grand as I'd like to be but I cried so were the other day about my age as I rounded up accidentally know I said I was like 29 and I was like I'm 24 round up for some reason like I don't get the rounding up it always happens like I am always doing that and I've done that since like 25 I think so yeah I don't I forgot we were texting if it's open fit some days can be so busy or head spinning especially now that the kids are back in school and you're running from work to soccer practice to the grocery store and all lights cast you probably forgot to focus on your work at would I mean I agree with that this ad apparently was written for someone with children which we do not have kids but I will say with school starting back up if you're in college maybe you haven't found the time to go to the gym yet and you're like I really don't know when and on my busy schedule of partying and drinking and going to class and doing homework like when am I going to have time to have a Rockin bod and luckily for you there's open fit because open fat is a streaming subscription you can work out in the comfort of your own home which is awesome I actually like straight-up did this like I got the subscription I texted the thing and I did it I did the 30 day fitness challenge that they have on there and I was taking their Barre classes and they're really good like they're really like there are like a challenging but they're really good like I felt sore like I felt like I was really like getting into shape when I was

getting fit and they also have like meal plans and it's really awesome it's affordable I don't know I don't know why you wouldn't do this to open fit has changed the way I work out and texting my

data rates may apply okay so this girl and she said actually not one girl about a hundred girls have Britain I've been like my friend is dating the worst fucking guy in the world this I sucks we hate him he's toxic he's the worst what do we do what do you do if your friend is dating someone you hate do you say something do you not feel like you, don't say something I feel like it was like the most depend on the level of friendship I feel if it's like you're fucking bestie like you have like I have two groups of friends Monica high school and college there are like like to pick 3 & 3 my fucking Bessie's if your boyfriend sucks I think we probably like make some jokes are boyfriend sex but then sometimes you have one friend who's just like dead set on the fact that he doesn't suck and you have to kind of go along with it but then and those cases very much like she says what's going on I think you wait to say something until like something gets for real like all the sudden it's like you you're moving in together or something like that I would be late on that are you sure about that kind of thing surely this isn't kind of like you know some sort of back hello from like that Billie bad relationship you're in before and I are moving in with somebody really quickly like what may be happening there I never know what to do because it's like you don't want to offend your friends not Everyone likes obviously my type is different from my friends type is different from this girl's types of writing and I don't want to be like that guy sucks but maybe he just texted me right but you can sometimes tell when someone a guy likes to look at the group consensus is that guy sucks been in most of the time he's terrible so is l y how do you bring it up in a way that's graceful you know I know it's one of my best friend's boyfriend sucks I keep fucking sucks and we all think he's Ox she will never hear this thing I'd like she'll never find this and he just like literally blows and none of us anything about it but she is nice witch like is he listens to her he's nice to her he didn't used to be now he's very nice to her so I keep thinking like okay maybe it just took a while for him to like Rowland us or him to like throw up a little bit so maybe you can come to wait to see that I just need to grow up especially if he's a dick act like you could also just pick a fight when you're in college a lot of listen to this podcast are in college graduated and it's like honestly the guys that you date at this age that age they don't fucking that or sit there terrible to give me an asshole just kind of guys I matter until you're above twenty-five my friends being like oh I can't believe I dated like all of us I once I was 20 425 it's like what I fucking disaster and it was mostly because like their brains are not fully formed and neither is your men take so much longer to grow up to be getting to the next year and got to work my sponsor.

Person however if your friends beforehand it's late but it's tough but you can say I think it's fair to be like this and we were friends before and like you know I'll I won't like talk about him all the time force you to go hang out with them in a group if they're all hanging out and like you're not around and you're not going out with us I'm not going to say no to like hang out with that it seems there but I'm not going to do go to that level I also think you can't delete the level of friendship whatever the level of friendship was when they broke up you can't go further than that totally didn't know he liked my best friend that's really the shoulder that he cries on know he can't talk a lot of girls fucking jump to do that a lot of girls love to jump in at that time like their identity mentality that's it there's a certain type of hate this like type of girl that's my least favorite because this is truly a girl that I have never been I've never been the girl that swoops in on a guy who just broke up with his girlfriend or something or like just got broken up with or broke up with her whatever she like be the shoulder to lean on him might be the friend and then like hope for more eventually for some reason the drive me fucking nuts I just don't like that you can't leave the thing where it's almost like I'm catching you in a vulnerable moment and I'm going to take advantage and then turn you into what I want you to be like that's how I felt it to me I mean yeah totally not that deep but I feel strongly about odd it is weird I had a terrible experience with a guy and immediately after we were we were friends before you know he's been talking to me about it and I feel like if you guys know then you could make up and I'm like why is he telling you I like the details and I am telling you the details you don't you don't you don't do that only take the side it's fine if you want to like Loosely be there for your friend like if you want to be like, like way sorry this is happening sorry like Bubba blah whatever and like still be friendly and so joking around or whatever but you can't be the one like tell me like when he's like texts everyday or the one he like I'm to East texting me because he doesn't want to text her like a bubble of blood that bullshit don't you can't put yourself in that position and I feel like that's that's like a slippery slope and you could fall into the have to be really careful I do think and I've always been like this I'm loyal to the point where I like if I wasn't really friends with your boyfriend I was friends with him because you guys were dating like he's walking dead to me like I will not be broken on my friend I will you do this to murder your life like I will I will actually like to find a way to like realize you look at your apartment your fucking dead now. However I will say it like to be a little if the person if it was like a sad breakup if it wasn't like a a cheetah situation if it was like we just fell out of love or like I like the guy fell out of love with a girl thought of like whatever in that case I think you can more sensitive about it but again you can't be that like dry or tomorrow I might like fine blow out these are really really good like they make you look wonderful time in China I think I look like a dead Victorian child that was so specific you do not look like a debit Oriental you do look a little bit like a porcelain doll although I will say which is why we can't tomorrow but I like a good actually get that Alia is that it's because I look like a child but I'm also right he'll write my best route from college also looks like a porcelain doll because she has Kate Middleton hair so it's really annoying when I think of you so far as you can be friends with them if you were friends them already yes and if it was a really bad breakup you cannot be the shoulder to cry on yes but if you didn't he weren't friends of him previously you got to be like a fuck that guy if your dad wants you to be like fuck that guy you can't be a pussy about it and I would like to go to be rude to anybody know you have to be rude to him because he makes me feel better if you rude to someone who is rude to me completely agree could not agree more also remember this for when somebody's fucking rude to you and you want your friend to be rude to them and they tell you I can tell anybody it's like no no no no no no I looked him in the face is that you're getting fatter yet so like it's good to see you look terrible to your bald spot that's crazy how's your job as a bank teller oh my God are you living with 12 guys still I love that your house has no house Hoboken is it cool if I feel like I'm so thank you for having me but thank you so much for coming on I hope you guys have something constructive out of us just being like yeah that's different cast make sure you saw her on Twitter it's at Kelly King.
