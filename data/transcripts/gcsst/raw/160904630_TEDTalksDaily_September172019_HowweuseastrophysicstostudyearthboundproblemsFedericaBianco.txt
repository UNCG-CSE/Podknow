this Ted Talk features Urban astrophysicist Federica Bianco recorded live at Ted 2019 I am an astrophysicist I research Stellar explosions Across the Universe but I'm restless and astrophysicists I have the incredible opportunity to study the entire universe the star of doing only that always done makes me feel caged and limited what if my issues with keeping attention and getting bored when not if Lotto what if I could turn them into an acid in astrophysicist cannot touch or interact with the things that she studies no way to explore starting a lot to figure out why or how I blew up just pictures and movies of the sky everything we know about the universe from The Big Bang the originator space and time to the formation of evolution of stars and galaxies to the structure of our own solar system we should go on the sky enter study assistance complex has the entire universe astrophysicists expert at extracting simple models and solutions from large and complex data so what else can I do with his expertise what if we turn the camera around toward us I do believe that is exactly what we're doing regular also an astrophysicist and my husband in 2015 and I joined in 2015 are some of the things that we do we take pictures of the city at night and study City Lights like stars changes over time and the color of astronomical lights I gain insight about the nature of exploding Stars by studying City Lights the same way we can measure and predict how much energy does he needs and consumes and helped build a resilient read that will support the needs of growing Urban environments in daytime images we capture tunes of pollution 75% of greenhouse gases in your city come from a building like this one burning oil for sheet you can measure pollution with air quality sensors but imagine putting a sensor on each New York City building reading in data from a million monitors imagine the cost we did two of NYU students will build a mathematical model in your network that can detect and track distance over the New York City skyline we can classify them harmless teams white and evanescent pollutant Smoke Stacks dark and persistent and provide policymakers with map of neighborhood pollution discuss disciplinary project create a transformational Solutions but the data analysis methodology using astrophysics can be applied to all sorts of data not just images we were asked to have a California District Attorney understand the prosecutorial delays in their jurisdiction they have people on probation or sitting in jail waiting for trial sometimes for years they wanted to know what kind of cases start on and had a massive data set to explode to understand it but didn't have the expertise or the instrument in the office to do so and that's where we came in I work with my colleagues public policy Professor Angela Hawkins and her team first created a visual dashboard Oda Stussy and better understand the prosecution process data looking to see if the duration of the process suffer from social inequalities in their jurisdiction we did so using methods that I would use to classify thousands of Stellar explosions apply mm of court cases that can be applied to other jurisdictions who are willing to explore their biases these collaborations between domain expert an astrophysicist create a transformational solutions to help improve people's quality of life but it is a two-way Road I bring my astrophysics background to Urban science and I bring what I learned in urban science back to astrophysics light Echoes the reflections of Stellar explosions onto Interstellar dust Nina images these Reflections appears as White evanescent Moving features just like Tunes I am adopting the same models that detect Tunes in City images to detect light occurs in images of the sky bass tuning the things that interest and excite me reaching outside of my domain I did for my restlessness into an asset we you all have a unique perspective the kitchen renew inside and lie to new unexpected transformational Solutions thank you from where TED Talks go to ted.com
