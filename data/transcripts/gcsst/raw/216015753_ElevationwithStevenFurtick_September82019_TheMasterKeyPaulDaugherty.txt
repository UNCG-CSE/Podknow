If you can do it to him maybe you can do it through me and in our church and I believe some of your here today you haven't found your Roar yet but the world is waiting to hear your Roar the world is waiting to see the Sons and Daughters of God revealed you were born to Roar you are not born to power back in fear or insecurity if you're in an atmosphere where there's a roar coming in this place well I know you're going to sit down here in just a second but I want to give you a scripture for where this message is going in Revelation 1 verse 18 Jesus is speaking to John the disciple who called himself John the Beloved he was convinced that Jesus loved him how many are convinced that Jesus loves you come on I'm convinced he loves me I wouldn't you wouldn't be here today God loves you so much he let you be in Elevation Church God loves you so much that he gave you an incredible pastor Pastor Steven and Holly furtick are they in my opinion they are the example for the world today pastor this church I just keep feeling like I need to tell you how amazing your Pastors in your churches John was in the middle of his worst test of adversity but he was about to experience his greatest revelation of God some of your right now in Exile he was on the island of Patmos he was alone he felt forgotten he was wondering where God was and in that moment God gave him the greatest revelation of his power and his word for the church and he said this Jesus speaks to John he says I'm the first and the last I am the living one I was dead and now look I am alive we serve a God who is alive forever and ever and I hold the keys if you got your keys with you this morning just pull them out and just hold them up and just jingling a little bit say I got the keys Jesus said I hold the keys to death and Hades in other words, I got the keys over Satan have stripped him of all the stories of all power in your life, sorry I hope it is responsibility and I love the Jesus doesn't keep the keys to himself in fact he says in Revelation 3 and I'm opening the door for you I'm giving you the keys and Matthew 16 verse 19 when he talks about building a church this so large so expensive expanding to the left into the right opening its 19th campus from all over the world watching online a church that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against Jesus says in Matthew 16 verse 19 and I will give you the keys to the kingdom and that's what I want to preach to you on today that you've got the keys the Lord I pray that you would speak to us today and that we would leave and courage refreshed and reminded that we have the keys to Victory we have the keys to peace we have the keys to Joy we have the keys to Freedom we have the keys to hope we have the keys to see you do which you've called us to do that you can move through us and Ennis I got our thank you Lord we have the keys God to give you praise this morning in Jesus name amen give God some praise as you're being seated tell to people you've got the keys you got the keys but you don't think about how keys don't just represent access into something the keys that God has given us are not just to unlock doors of what we're called to walk into but to lock doors stuff that's trying to come into our life but the keys are not just meant for you to access God's presence in to come in and have joy it's also to lock the devil from coming in to wreak havoc on your mind and your marriage and your heart I came to tell you today some of you have keys that you're not using some of us have keys that we forgotten our in our pocket and so we're letting depression come in we're letting anxiety and panic and worry and fear and discouragement self-doubt and we're letting the enemy just come right into our house I got say come on I've given you the keys to whatever you bind on Earth is bound in heaven whatever you loose on Earth is loosed in heaven somebody said I have the keys but when I was younger my dad begin to teach me that the keys are not a physical thing they're there a spiritual thing it's not so much the keys that we have to drive a car to get into our house to get into our office is something on the inside the way the keys work there activated in the spirit as I want to give you a few ways to start activating your keys number one hits in how you see yourself as in how you see God it's and how you see the problems that you're facing in the Bible from the Old Testament to the New Testament God would use this word believe believe that's an internal thing to believe that anything is possible to believe to see where God is about to take you God spoke to Joshua Joshua 6 verse to see I am giving you Jericho you've got to see the victory before you see the victory you got to see the miracle before you see the miracle when I was younger my dad took me my older brother my two older sisters out to undeveloped land and Tulsa Oklahoma and he would what do you see I remember standing there with my dad Billy Joe my mom Sharon and they were you know they were passed during this large church that was reaching all of Tulsa and was doing missions work all over the world I saw you know, Dad I don't know what I see I see ants I see trash I see grass I see you know dark hills around. What do you see here what do you see in here what are you seeing here he said the problem is pull your eyes are opened you have to close your eyes to really see and what we learn in the word of God is that the kingdom is is is not Advance through a matter of Natural Science butcher a matter of spiritual side to be able to see with eyes of faith and I remember my dad saying I see a church that's so large so expensive thousands of people coming thousands of people getting saved marriage is being restored families being reconciled ICS Building a Dream Center over here feeding the hungry clothing the naked giving people the chance to. green against changing the crime rates in our city, I see a Bible College in a camp and a school and I'm scratching my eyes and I don't see it I don't see it he said why see it in here and it's just a matter of time before see it out there every single thing that he spoke came to pass every single thing today there's a Dream Center Camp College a school kindergarten through 12th grade at church there's Mission Training Center he taught me that you have to see it and hear Proverbs 23 says as a man thinketh so is he Proverbs 29:6 without a vision people perish if you don't have a vision for where your life is going you're going to cast off restraint you're going to live with no purpose you got to see where God wants to take you to see what God can do through when God spoke to Gideon in Judges chapter 6 he said hey mighty warrior I'm calling you to fight for Israel I'm calling you to win a battle for Israel Gideon said who you're talking to I'm the youngest I can relate to get it cuz I'm the youngest and I'm weak and so what I'm reading the scripture Gideon sees himself one way but God sees him a different way and how you see yourself and how you see God is the most important thing about your life because we move in the direction of our vision what do you see David when he ran out towards Goliath he saw a giant it was too big to miss but the other Israelites are giant it was too big for them to conquer and it's all a matter of sight how you see your life how you see your circumstances some of you right now are facing some you're facing some Giants you're facing some Jericho's and God said I want you to see it with eyes of faith that anything is possible if you were not born with limitations you were born with possibilities you are not born about down to a spirit of fear to run from Goliath we were born to chase the Lions to slay the Giants when I first started preaching I was so nervous I peed my pants on stage Dove for real and I ran off the stage into the boys bathroom and I cried and I was so insecure so worried and God said go out there and do it again and I had to start changing the way that I saw myself cuz I didn't see myself as a preacher I didn't see myself very good even though I had a passion to do it when I first started preaching in our church and we put our messages online I was excited cuz people started watching our messages on YouTube and and then I looked below the YouTube video and there's these thumbs up thumbs down and I zoomed in on the thumbs down and I was like what and my identity was not wrapped in how God's Tommy but in how other people saw me and I began to just feel this flood of insecurity discouragement and then I started going on Google who were the thumbs down people you can't find them they're not honest I was going to find him I was like what do you not like about me what's wrong with me how do I get you to like me. Looking for other people to approve you when I've already approved you stop looking for others validation already validated you that fox didn't shake you so don't let their thoughts break you their thoughts didn't create you so don't let their thoughts begin to form you into who you think you should we got to come back to how God sees us. Sees you wonderfully and fearfully made he sees you as more than a conqueror God sees you as a mighty warrior number to the way that we unlock those doors the way that we activate our keys if they're serving for serving you know I started serving in our church cuz when your pastors can you have to serve we were we were free labor for my parents so my dad is like you're the children's Pastor you're going to work here and since I was the youngest I didn't have a title or position I just have to serve my older siblings so I started serving in the children's church serving in the youth group and I started playing guitar playing piano and I tried out for our youth worship and I was so pumped to go to auditions and people are sitting on a table judging me afterwards they posted the list of who made the use Worship in and I wasn't on the list I said guys there's a problem with this I don't see my name and they said oh you didn't make it my sister was the worship leader I was like come on I'm your brother she said you're not good enough get mad and she said there will be another audition year and 4 months and I go home I call my dad on my dad you need to fire her right now why will she rejected me all that's good that you are rejected what you need to be rejected you know but my dad was saying Paul you don't need a title to serve you don't need a position to serve just go serve where there's a need finding me to meet it see a hurt and healer just start serving in the church is serving is beneath you than leading is above you if you're too big to served you're too small to leave some of us are waiting on a title or position for a platform and got sent start serving where I have you start serving where I need you so I try that again kept trying out didn't make it was reading was ushering was serving and other areas finally the fourth time I try out they said here's the problem Paul you got pride and we need some humility I said there might just get off the stage and they said we have an opportunity for you to lead worship from 9 a.m. children's church which is the lowest attended Children Service and they said you can lead a connect group and you can lead worship as the assistant worship leader as so I remember going into that children's church I was 18 years old and I started leading worship they're throwing Starburst into my guitar hole and no one's listening it was really sad I was just like yes Lord yes Lord and and so I started your serving there every week every week went to college was serving a children's church couldn't get a job at College I had a lawn mowing business but I wasn't making enough to pay for my college books and courses and and so the only job that was available was to be a janitor at our University as so I started doing the janitor job I started cleaning up trash did it for three years started cleaning up the baseball stadium and during that time I was riding the songs I remember riding the song as I was in the baseball stadium picking up people's nachos no matter where you at right now God sees you God sees you and no one else sees you when you feel invisible God sees you I see God this is humiliating this is humiliating and I heard God say your humiliation is preparation for an elevation their humiliation is preparation for an acceleration see so many people want to jump Seasons because we're watching other people's stories were seeing them get to do stuff and got say get your eyes off of everyone else's story I've got a story for you start on in Your Story start being right here and even if it feels humiliating this is preparation for an elevation where I'm taking you so I started writing this song as I'm picking up nachos in the song was from John chapter 3 verse decrease you must increase and recording it and put it on a CD and one of my friends gave it to her University is a Christian University and they were doing a live album and they were looking for songs they found my song and so they called me they said we want to put your song on the new album I said what I said yes. Only problem is we don't want you to sing cuz your voice ain't good we want your friend Brad to saying I was but you could sing in the choir I didn't even make the choir my freshman to sophomore year now they want me to sing in the choir my junior year remember that night we're recording it there's Kari Jobe there's a couple other worship leaders and there's my friend singing my song and I'm back in the choir in the dark just standing back there and be singing my song and I'm like he must decrease and I must increase God was like this is so good for you humiliate session is preparation for an elevation so I kept serving just kept showing up and finally I graduated from Cemetery I finished all my Bible classes and there was an open job at the church and I applied for it got the job to start working in college Ministry and was so excited to work for my dad this is about 10 and 1/2 years ago I dreamed of serving my mom and dad and working to build the church and so I can tell my dad I said Dad I'm ready I cannot. The job and he said that's great that's great cuz he didn't want to be the one that hired me he wanted to leave it up to the supervisor said that I got the job I'm ready for my keys to Victory 44 about keys to Victory tsakis you only need one key son I said Dad I'm your own flesh and blood the janitors have more than one key can I get one guy was a gender at the college and I had a nice to know you only get a key to your office that's the only can you get I was like Dad why don't you trust me why do you need more keys I just want access I want access I wanted to hurt it is like no no no just use your key just just use your key fast forward or our College Ministry started to grow I was preaching all the Stephen sermons and Christian takes thank you Pastor and I gave him credit he actually saw me preaching a sermon online and he was like hey I saw you preaching a sermon I was like oh snap it was one of his but I remember getting a call from my mom she said hey come to the hospital your dad's up here I said who's he visiting who's he praying for she said he's up here I got up there in the doctor told our family that my dad has stage 4 lymphoma cancer they said that I just I lost it and I just started bawling I said why he's been nothing but good good man of integrity. Why is this happening and I didn't realize that my face was built on answered prayers my faith was built on everything going my wife you see when you face a crisis you find out what your faith is made of either your faith is on shifting sand or it's on a solid rock on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand all other ground is sinking sand but in that moment I was caving in I was losing my faith because my faith was wrapped up in him being healed has your pastor said before sometimes you get to see the miracle and sometimes you get to be the miracle and I remember praying for my dad and the night that he passed I was in the hospital room couldn't go to sleep stay there through the night watching the EKG monitor praying for Resurrection Life I watched my hero my pastor my daddy pass away I was so overwhelmed cuz I was thinking about the church I was thinking about our family think about my mom cuz I had just gotten married. What's going to happen we need him our church is not going to make it without him our it was just built so much on his voice he just was a Visionary he was such a great preacher a great pastor and a great dad I heard God speak this to me my heart not audibly just this impression and I heard God said your dad finished his race it's time for you to run yours and then I felt like it continued it was like the voice continue to serve your mom serve the church I didn't know this but they were about to make my mom the interim pastor for a season she's my hero cuz she's a persevere she is the definition of perseverance I heard God say serve your mom serve the church and get ready because you're about to be the pastor of Victory. Turn on I'm 23 years old I'm the youngest of my siblings and there's so many other great preachers in our church this is not from God but I heard dad say no serve your mom serve the church and get ready cuz you're about to pass through victory and I know what happens when you share a vision too soon I heard you know what happened to Joseph he got sold as a slave so I was like I'm not telling nobody this vision nobody needs to know this I told my wife she said yeah let's keep that between us a year went by during that next year I remember many nights coming up to our church my keys while my dad was in the hospital you didn't he let me use his car and then we had to sell it afterwards but I remember just questioning whether I really had the authority ability to pastor and many nights I would come to our church just to go and pray just to play the piano to sing to worship to practice preaching on this stage my dad built this massive Auditorium that honestly was intimidating as 4500 seats the year before he passed away because we were a mobile church for 30 plus years we rented out a large building in our city and finally the dream of a debt free Church Auditorium and all of this was built and then he passed away and I remember many nights trying to get into the church but I couldn't get in because I didn't have the keys so I would have to call a security guard college janitor they would come and let me in and it wasn't just a physical feeling of not having the keys it was a mental and emotional feeling but I didn't have the keys of confidence I didn't have the keys to preach like he preached I didn't have the keys to cast Vision like he did I I didn't have the keys to pray for people to get healed people have called me and I say hey can you come pray for my brother he's sick in the hospital and I would make an excuse not because I didn't care I did care but I felt like my prayers didn't work I felt like I didn't have the key to that I was like call Pastor Steve and he can make the sun stand still call Bishop TD Jakes call call someone who has the keys cuz I don't and then the board met with me a year later they said you need to know something your dad told us that you would be the next Pastor Victory never told me they said yeah but he said that you were really young and the church was so large and so many employees that you weren't ready yet you needed to be developed see a lot a lot of people want God to elevate their platform but they're not willing to let God develop their character and we got to go through the developmental phase it's dark it's frustrating where you want to quit or you don't feel like you have what it takes and God saying I'm pulling out insecurities I'm pulling out those feelings of fear pulling out those needs of the approval of man those thumbs up that you're looking for I'm pulling some stuff out there's some junk I got to get out to remind you who you are in Christ so I remember leaving that board meeting and once again just telling me I don't have the keys so week went by I went to our church one night and I was outside of the building and I called our security guard and I said hey could you let me into the church I just want to come in and pray and worship and he said call him walking up all the doors at the church I'm walking up all the doors at the Dream Center is going to be at least an hour before I can get there you're just going to have to wait I didn't want to wait cuz I was I was in such a dork discouraging place I just type and I've got to get in there so I start trying to break into our church right I start hitting the door and I don't have muscles like Pastor furtick so I'm like hurting my hand and then I took my credit card out I tried to shimmy it through the crack of the door and nothing was working that's not okay maybe I'll take this one key that I have and try to shove it into the door and then put my shoulder against it and open it so I took the key out and I tried to shove it but it just fit perfect into the door I thought okay okay what's going on right now and it dawned on me I've never tried this and I turn the key and if I unlocked the door I was like God did you just change my key no I seriously was like I was looking up at heaven cuz that you know Bible says that we're surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses and I can just picture my dad leaning over the grandstands of Heaven I was like huh should I walked across to the choir room and unlock that then I walked over to the drum closet nobody has a key to the drum closet and it unlocked at then I walked into the main Auditorium and that was the room that intimidated me the most and I stuck my key in that door and it unlocked the door suddenly a flood of emotions came over me I was I was weeping because I was like what I was waiting for two reasons I was like I've had the master key this whole time I was also weeping because the master key I didn't know it and suddenly I looked in the room and what once was intimidating I walked on that stage and I heard God say you've got it you've got it it's Christ in you Colossians 1:27 Christ in me the hope of glory Christ in me is the master key you see elevation I came to tell you this weekend you have the master key you don't need a bunch of keys all you need is one key and you have the master key that unlocks the door to Victory you have the master key to unlock the door to be free for new security if you have the master key that unlocks to talk to healing in your marriage you have the keys and I'll have to talk to so I can get the keys can I have to talk to peace in your life it's not you it's Jesus in you was Christ in me that is the master key suddenly sucking started to explode in my mind and I started realizing I've got what it takes, I'll tell someone next to you you've got the master key so you've got what it takes yeah yeah because at the bottom of this message that's the real question is do I have what it takes but I started realizing that the master key doesn't work unless I use it it it been in my pocket the whole time but I wasn't using it some of you have had the key to the thing that's in your heart but you have not been using if you've been questioning do I really have it I've got to get Pastor Steven to tell me I've got it God's telling you right now you've got it you've got the key to the dreams that are in your heart stop doubting yourself and stop questioning do I have it that's in you got this I realize that the key is Not Just Vision activated it's not just serving activated it's voice activated it's in the words that I speak see I talk it I've been talking so negative cuz I have been listening to this chatter box of negativity of discouragement and I didn't know how to turn it off so I just kept saying how best days are behind us and I heard God say Paul you have the master key so change the words you speak change the words you're speaking so I started speaking our best days are right in front of us God's not finished with us yet it came one night when I was getting ready to preach and my mom gave me a pair of my dad shoes to remember my dad by I took it a step further I started wearing his shoes and I started dressing just like he dressed cuz I thought maybe if I wear his shoes and wear his clothes people like me more if it didn't work they hated me more they were like Paul wear your own shoes I just one night I was so discouraged to get up and preach and even though I knew I had the master key I just felt like I don't have a good word people don't want to hear me then when hear my dad they want to hear some other preacher and got some change the narrative so I wrote down on the snap and I'm here on purpose I'm here I'm here on purpose I stopped right there the enemy of here is there the enemy of here is some place else with someone else doing something else you've been watching too many other people's stories you need to own being right here you are here on purpose what did your mom and dad a janitor and teenager a college students what do you can't pay the bills you are here on purpose because you have a purpose right where you are and I want to shout out those who are serving in the church on any team if you serve any kids or you serve in the parking lot where you serve in any Pokemon give it up for the volunteers that make this place happen where you are as bright will talk with you you're here on purpose I started speaking that because the Bible says that life and death is in the power of the tongue the Bible says that we can prophesy over our future when I was young I used to be really wild and crazy I was add and you're like not surprised by that my dad used to put his hand on my head cuz I be like a peaceful peaceful Paul and now I'm peaceful what are you speaking over your children what are you speaking over your future I want the keys to come out cuz I'm almost done right here but I want you to Envision that you're on a field what's what do you see where do you see your life what do you see that's possible because God wants you to get a big Vision he wants you to get a big you were not born with limitations but born with possibilities and you have the master key to start declaring that your best days are still in front of you see I started saying that I started getting our church this and they started saying it I started telling people they ever wanted section see people turn around there was no one in section c when my dad passed thousands of people left the church and I had to start speaking to those empty seats I had to start prophesying someone in that seat somebody that's it because I saw this place being filled with people who needed Jesus can I tell you elevation there's an empty seat at some campus that's waiting for somebody's life to be changed never stop reaching people never stop filling up building never stop inviting your neighbors to somebody's life is waiting on you don't ever get comfortable with where we're at because we have not seen our best days yet elevation we have not seen our greatest Miracles yet you haven't heard the best sermons yet you haven't seen the greatest miracle the best series the best Miracles the best campus beer cuz there's going to be a credible things what the door doesn't open until you unlock it and you got to start declaring you can sit down I promise I landed just a minute while I kiss this Tennessee right now Popeyes will still be open it may not have chicken sandwiches but it will still be open Chick-fil-A on Sunday but you know I one night I was walking and we just had our second baby our finances are in a tough spot as a church right when I stepped in his pasture I begin Pastor in 2014 just five years ago this month and this wealthy man who had left our church he invited me to his office and he said hey I left whenever your dad passed but I'm ready to come back ready to help you with finances to praise God cuz I had to let go of so many people in my dad passed we couldn't afford to pay all these people and I thought I was going to have to close down the college in the school in the camp and I just felt so overwhelmed 28 years old just turned 29 is that time I'm going to help you but I need you to do this this this and this and you begin to list these things I heard God whisper in my heart are you going to trust in man's money are you going to trust in Jehovah Jireh I thought this was a test I thought there was hidden cameras so I looked at the man I said sir thank you for being willing to help cuz he he could have financed the whole thing I mean he was a very wealthy person but I said I can't do those things unless God tells me I'm not going to sell the ministry that the pulpit is not up for prostitution I'm not going to let anyone buy this church for by the decisions of this house but there were no hidden cameras in he never ended up coming panda a year-and-a-half a pass we had her second child and one night I'm walking on this street I come across the bridge it was dark I was discouraged and I just heard that no one cares just in the pants we're living in a time right now we're so many pastors are dealing personally with doubt and discouragement so many young pastors are trying to fill the shoes a pair of tennis I mean y'all need to pray always be praying for the church out there so many people having our world our nation America is on so much medication to try to deal with anxiety and depression and discouragement and I was right there on that bridge and I don't know if I'm speaking to someone is watching this later on it's standing on a bridge but I could hear the enemy just whisper just jumped in the pain Church be better off without you I felt like I was in a basement beneath house but I wasn't just one floor below I was five basements below where I should have been that's the only way I can describe depression is you just too far below where you should be mentally and emotionally but I felt like there was a raindrop coming from Heaven it's like my dad was just dropping Little Raindrops the Bible says train your children up in the way they should go and they will not depart from it never underestimate get your family to church never underestimate City skip your kids and big kids getting your youth the youth group here listen there's something powerful about being raised in in those presence of God in the scriptures and all the sudden started coming on my head you're more than a conqueror you're fearfully wonderfully made you've got what it takes to see the final point of this message is surrender because it was in this moment of surrender you can see it you can serve it you can speak but the final moments that you activate the Keys of the Kingdom is when you surrender and say God I can't do it.

If you can do it to him maybe you can do it through me and in our church and I believe some of your here today you haven't found your Roar yet but the world is waiting to hear your Roar the world is waiting to see the Sons and Daughters of God revealed you were born to Roar you are not born to power back in fear or insecurity if you're in an atmosphere where there's a roar coming in this place well I know you're going to sit down here in just a second but I want to give you a scripture for where this message is going in Revelation 1 verse 18 Jesus is speaking to John the disciple who called himself John the Beloved he was convinced that Jesus loved him how many are convinced that Jesus loves you come on I'm convinced he loves me I wouldn't you wouldn't be here today God loves you so much she let you be in Elevation Church God loves you so much that he gave you an incredible pastor Pastor Steven and Holly furtick are they in my opinion they are the example for the world today pastor this church but I keep feeling like I need to tell you how amazing your Pastors in your churches John was in the middle of his worst test of adversity but he was about to experience his greatest revelation of God some of your right now in Exile he was on the island of Patmos he was alone he felt forgotten he was wondering where God was and in that moment God gave him the greatest revelation of his power and his word for the church and he said this Jesus speaks to John he says I'm the first and the last I am the living one I was dead and now look I am alive we serve a God who is alive forever and ever and I hold the keys if you got your keys with you this morning just pull them out and just hold them up and just jingling a little bit say I got the keys Jesus said I hold the keys to death and Hades in other words, I got the keys over Satan have stripped him of all the stories of all power in your life, sorry I hope it is responsibility and I love the Jesus doesn't keep the keys to himself in fact he says in Revelation 3 and I'm opening the door for you I'm giving you the keys and Matthew 16 verse 19 when he talks about building a church this so large so expensive expanding to the left into the right opening its 19th campus from all over the world watching online a church that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against Jesus says in Matthew 16 verse 19 and I will give you the keys to the kingdom and that's what I want to preach to you on today that you've got the keys the Lord I pray that you would speak to us today and that we would leave and courage refreshed and reminded that we have the keys to Victory we have the keys to peace we have the keys to Joy we have the keys to Freedom we have the keys to hope we have the keys to see you do which you've called us to do that you can move through us and Ennis I got our thank you Lord we have the keys God to give you praise this morning in Jesus name amen give God some praise as you're being seated tell to people you've got the keys you got the keys but you don't think about how keys don't just represent access into something the keys that God has given us are not just to unlock doors of what we're called to walk into but to lock doors stuff that's trying to come into our life but the keys are not just meant for you to access God's presence in to come in and have joy it's also to lock the devil from coming in to wreak havoc on your mind and your marriage and your heart I came to tell you today some of you have keys that you're not using some of us have keys that we forgotten our in our pocket and so we're letting depression come in we're letting anxiety and panic and worry and fear and discouragement self-doubt and we're letting the enemy just come right into our house I got say come on I've given you the keys to whatever you bind on Earth is bound in heaven whatever you loose on Earth is loosed in heaven somebody said I have the keys but when I was younger my dad begin to teach me that the keys are not a physical thing they're there a spiritual thing it's not so much the keys that we have to drive a car to get into our house to get into our office is something on the inside the way the keys work they're activated in the spirit as I want to give you a few ways to start activating your keys number one it's in how you see yourself as in how you see God it's and how you see the problems that you're facing in the Bible from the Old Testament to the New Testament God would use this word believe believed that's an internal thing to believe that anything is possible to believe to see where God is about to take you God spoke to Joshua Joshua 6 verse to see I am giving you Jericho you've got to see the victory before you see the victory you got to see the miracle before you see the miracle when I was younger my dad took me my older brother my two older sisters out to undeveloped land and Tulsa Oklahoma and he would what do you see I remember standing there with my dad Billy Joe my mom Sharon and they were you know they were passed during this large church that was reaching all of Tulsa and was doing missions work all over the world I saw you know, Dad I don't know what I see I see ants I see trash I see grass I see you know dark hills around. What do you see here what do you see in here what are you seeing here he said the problem is pull your eyes are opened you have to close your eyes to really see and what we learn in the word of God is that the kingdom is is is not Advance through a matter of Natural Science butcher a matter of spiritual side to be able to see with eyes of faith and I remember my dad saying I see a church that's so large so expensive thousands of people coming thousands of people getting saved marriage is being restored families being reconciled ICS Building a Dream Center over here feeding the hungry clothing the naked giving people the chance to. green against changing the crime rates in our city, I see a Bible College in a camp and a school and I'm scratching my eyes and I don't see it I don't see it he said why see it in here and it's just a matter of time before see it out there every single thing that he spoke came to pass every single thing today there's a Dream Center Camp College a school kindergarten through 12th grade Church there's Mission Training Center he taught me that you have to see it and hear Proverbs 23 says as a man thinketh so is he Proverbs 29:6 without a vision people perish if you don't have a vision for where your life is going you're going to cast off restraint you're going to live with no purpose you got to see where God wants to take you to see what God can do through when God spoke to Gideon in Judges chapter 6 he said hey mighty warrior I'm calling you to fight for Israel I'm calling you to win a battle for Israel Gideon said who you're talking to I'm the youngest I can relate to get it cuz I'm the youngest and I'm weak and so what I'm reading the scripture Gideon sees himself one way but God sees him a different way and how you see yourself and how you see God is the most important thing about your life because we move in the direction of our vision what do you see David when he ran out towards Goliath he saw a giant it was too big to miss but the other Israelites are giant it was too big for them to conquer and it's all a matter of sight how you see your life how you see your circumstances some of you right now are facing some you're facing some Giants you're facing some Jericho's and God said I want you to see it with eyes of faith that anything is possible if you were not born with limitations you were born with possibilities you are not born about down to a spirit of fear to run from Goliath we were born to chase the Lions to slay the Giants when I first started preaching I was so nervous I peed my pants on stage Dove for real and I ran off the stage into the boys bathroom and I cried and I was so insecure so worried and God said go out there and do it again and I had to start changing the way that I saw myself cuz I didn't see myself as a preacher I didn't see myself very good even though I had a passion to do it when I first started preaching in our church and we put our messages online I was excited cuz people started watching our messages on YouTube and and then I looked below the YouTube video and there's these thumbs up thumbs down and I zoomed in on the thumbs down and I was like what and my identity was not wrapped in how God's Tommy butt and how other people saw me and I began to just feel this flood of insecurity discouragement and then I started going on Google who are the people you can't find them they're not honest I was going to find him I was like what do you not like about me what's wrong with me how do I get you to like me. Looking for other people to approve you when I've already approved you stop looking for others validation already validated you that fox didn't shake you so don't let their thoughts break you their thoughts didn't create you so don't let their thoughts begin to form you into who you think you should we got to come back to how God sees us. Sees you wonderfully and fearfully made he sees you as more than a conqueror God sees you as a mighty warrior number to the way that we unlock those doors the way that we activate our keys if they're serving for serving you know I started serving in our church cuz when your pastors can you have to serve we were we were free labor for my parents so my dad is like you're the children's Pastor you're going to work here and since I was the youngest I didn't have a title or position I just have to serve my older siblings so I started serving in the children's church serving in the youth group and I started playing guitar playing piano and I tried out for our youth worship and I was so pumped to go to auditions and people are sitting on a table judging me and afterwards they posted the list of who made the use Worship in and I wasn't on the list I said guys there's a problem with this I don't see my name and they said oh you didn't make it my sister was the worship leader I was like come on I'm your brother she said you're not good enough get mad and she said there will be another audition year and 4 months and I go home I call my dad on my dad you need to fire her right now why will she rejected me all that's good that you were rejected what you need to be rejected you know but my dad was saying Paul you don't need a title to serve you don't need a position to serve just go serve where there's a need finding me to meet it see a hurt and healer just start serving in the church that is serving is beneath you than leading is above you if you're too big to serve you're too small to leave some of us are waiting on a title or position for a platform and got sent start serving where I have you start serving where I need you so I try that again kept trying out didn't make it was reading was ushering was serving and other areas finally the fourth time I try out they said here's the problem Paul you got pride and we need some humility I said I am the humblest just get off the stage and they said we have an opportunity for you to lead worship from 9 a.m. children's church which is the lowest attended Children Service and they said you can lead a connect group and you can lead worship as the assistant worship leader as so I remember going into that children's church I was 18 years old and I started leading worship they're throwing Starburst into my guitar hole and no one's listening it was really sad I was just like yes Lord yes Lord and and so I started your serving there every week every week went to college was serving a children's church couldn't get a job at College I had a lawn mowing business but I wasn't making enough to pay for my college books and courses and and so the only job that was available was to be a janitor at our University as so I started doing the janitor job I started cleaning up trash did it for three years started cleaning up the baseball stadium and during that time I was riding the songs I remember riding the song as I was in the baseball stadium picking up people's nachos no matter where you at right now God sees you God sees you and no one else sees you when you feel invisible God sees you I see God this is humiliating this is humiliating and I heard God say your humiliation is preparation for an elevation their humiliation is preparation for an acceleration see so many people want to jump Seasons because we're watching other people's stories were seeing them get to do stuff and got say get your eyes off of everyone else's story I've got a story for you start on in Your Story start being right here and even if it feels humiliating this is preparation for an elevation where I'm taking you so I started writing this song as I'm picking up nachos in the song was from John chapter 3 verse decrease you must increase and recording it and put it on a CD and one of my friends gave it to her University is a Christian University and they were doing a live album and they were looking for songs they found my song and so they called me they said we want to put your song on the new album I said what I said yes. Only problem is we don't want you to sing cuz your voice ain't good we want your friend Brad to saying I was but you could sing in the choir I didn't even make the choir my freshman to sophomore year now they want me to sing in the choir my junior year remember that night we're recording it there's Kari Jobe there's a couple other worship leaders and there's my friend singing my song and I'm back in the choir in the dark just standing back there and be singing my song and I'm like he must decrease and I must increase God was like this is so good for you humiliate session is preparation for an elevation so I kept serving just kept showing up and finally I graduated from Cemetery I finished all my Bible classes and there was an open job at the church and I applied for it got the job to start working in college Ministry and was so excited to work for my dad this is about 10 and 1/2 years ago I dreamed of serving my mom and dad and working to build the church and so I can tell my dad I said Dad I'm ready I cannot. The job and he said that's great that's great cuz he didn't want to be the one that hired me he wanted to leave it up to the supervisor said that I got the job I'm ready for my keys to Victory 44 about keys to Victory tsakis you only need one key son I said Dad I'm your own flesh and blood the janitors have more than one key can I get one guy was a gender at the college and I had a nice to know you only get a key to your office that's the only can you get I was like Dad why don't you trust me why do you need more keys I just want access I want access I wanted to hurt it is like no no no just use your key just just use your key fast forward or our College Ministry started to grow I was preaching all the Stephen sermons and Christian takes thank you Pastor and I gave him credit he actually saw me preaching a sermon online and he was like hey I saw you preaching a sermon I was like oh snap it was one of his but I remember getting a call from my mom she said hey come to the hospital your dad's up here I said who's he visiting who's he praying for she said he's up here I got up there in the doctor told our family that my dad has stage 4 lymphoma cancer they said that I just I lost it and I just started bawling I said why he's been nothing but good good man of integrity. Why is this happening and I didn't realize that my face was built on answered prayers my faith was built on everything going my wife you see when you face a crisis you find out what your faith is made of either your faith is on shifting sand or it's on a solid rock on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand all other ground is sinking sand but in that moment I was caving in I was losing my faith because my faith was wrapped up in him being healed has your pastor said before sometimes you get to see the miracle and sometimes you get to be the miracle and I remember praying for my dad and the night that he passed I was in the hospital room couldn't go to sleep stay there through the night watching the EKG monitor praying for Resurrection Life I watched my hero my pastor my daddy pass away I was so overwhelmed cuz I was thinking about the church I was thinking about our family think about my mom cuz I had just gotten married. What's going to happen we need him our church is not going to make it without him our it was just built so much on his voice he just was a Visionary he was such a great preacher a great pastor and a great dad I heard God speak this to me my heart not audibly just this impression and I heard God said your dad finished his race it's time for you to run yours and then I felt like it continued it was like the voice continue to serve your mom serve the church I didn't know this but they were about to make my mom the interim pastor for a season she's my hero cuz she's a persevere she is the definition of perseverance I heard God say serve your mom serve the church and get ready because you're about to be the pastor of Victory. Turn on I'm 23 years old I'm the youngest of my siblings and there's so many other great preachers in our church this is not from God but I heard dad say no serve your mom serve the church and get ready cuz you're about to pass through victory and I know what happens when you share a vision too soon I heard you know what happened to Joseph he got sold as a slave so I was like I'm not telling nobody this vision nobody needs to know this I told my wife she said yeah let's keep that between us a year went by during that next year I remember many nights coming up to our church my keys while my dad was in the hospital you didn't he let me use his car and then we had to sell it afterwards but I remember just questioning whether I really had the authority ability to pastor and many nights I would come to our church just to go and pray just to play the piano to sing to worship to practice preaching on this stage my dad built this massive Auditorium that honestly was intimidating as 4500 seats the year before he passed away because we were a mobile church for 30 plus years we rented out a large building in our city and finally the dream of a debt free Church Auditorium and all of this was built and then he passed away and I remember many nights trying to get into the church but I couldn't get in because I didn't have the keys so I would have to call a security guard college janitor they would come and let me in and it wasn't just a physical feeling of not having the keys it was a mental and emotional feeling but I didn't have the keys of confidence I didn't have the keys to preach like he preached I didn't have the keys to cast Vision like he did I I didn't have the keys to pray for people to get healed people have called me and I say hey can you come pray for my brother he's sick in the hospital and I would make an excuse not because I didn't care I did care but I felt like my prayers didn't work I felt like I didn't have the key to that I was like call Pastor Steve and he can make the sun stand still call Bishop TD Jakes call call someone who has the keys cuz I don't and then the board met with me a year later they said you need to know something your dad told us that you would be the next Pastor Victory never told me they said yeah but he said that you were really young and the church was so large and so many employees that you weren't ready yet you needed to be developed see a lot a lot of people want God to elevate their platform but they're not willing to let God develop their character and we got to go through the developmental phase it's dark it's frustrating where you want to quit or you don't feel like you have what it takes and God saying I'm pulling out insecurities I'm pulling out those feelings of fear pulling out those needs of the approval of man those thumbs up that you're looking for I'm pulling some stuff out there's some junk I got to get out to remind you who you are in Christ so I remember leaving that board meeting and once again just telling me I don't have the keys so week went by I went to our church one night and I was outside of the building and I called our security guard and I said hey could you let me into the church I just want to come in and pray and worship and he said call him walking up all the doors at the church I'm walking up all the doors at the Dream Center is going to be at least an hour before I can get there you're just going to have to wait I didn't want to wait cuz I was I was in such a dork discouraging place I just type and I've got to get in there so I start trying to break into our church right I start hitting the door and I don't have muscles like Pastor furtick so I'm like hurting my hand and then I took my credit card out I tried to shimmy it through the crack of the door and nothing was working that's not okay maybe I'll take this one key that I have and try to shove it into the door and then put my shoulder against it and open it so I took the key out and I tried to shove it but it just fit perfect into the door I thought okay okay what's going on right now and it dawned on me I've never tried this and I turn the key and if I unlocked the door I was like God did you just change my key no I seriously was like I was looking up at heaven cuz that you know Bible says that we're surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses and I can just picture my dad leaning over the grandstands of Heaven I was like huh should I walked across to the choir room and unlock that then I walked over to the drum closet nobody has a key to the drum closet and it unlocked at then I walked into the main Auditorium and that was the room that intimidated me the most and I stuck my key in that door and it unlocked the door suddenly a flood of emotions came over me I was I was weeping because I was like what I was waiting for two reasons I was like I've had the master key this whole time I was also weeping because the master key I didn't know it and suddenly I looked in the room and what once was intimidating I walked on that stage and I heard God say you've got it you've got it it's Christ in you Colossians 1:27 Christ in me the hope of glory Christ in me is the master key you see elevation I came to tell you this weekend you have the master key you don't need a bunch of keys all you need is one key and you have the master key that unlocks the door to Victory you have the master key to unlock the door to be free for new security if you have the master key that unlocks to talk to healing in your marriage you have the keys and I'll have to talk to so I can get the keys can I have to talk to peace in your life it's not you it's Jesus in you was Christ in me that is the master key suddenly sucking started to explode in my mind and I started realizing I've got what it takes, I'll tell someone next to you you've got the master key so you've got what it takes yeah yeah because at the bottom of this message that's the real question is do I have what it takes but I started realizing that the master key doesn't work unless I use it it it been in my pocket the whole time but I wasn't using it some of you have had the key to the thing that's in your heart but you have not been using if you've been questioning do I really have it I've got to get Pastor Steven to tell me I've got it God's telling you right now you've got it you've got the key to the dreams that are in your heart stop doubting yourself and stop questioning do I have it that's in you got this I realize that the key is Not Just Vision activated it's not just serving activated it's voice activated it's in the words that I speak see I talk it I've been talking so negative cuz I have been listening to this chatter box of negativity of discouragement and I didn't know how to turn it off so I just kept saying how best days are behind us and I heard God say Paul you have the master key so change the words you speak change the words you're speaking so I started speaking our best days are right in front of us God's not finished with us yet it came one night when I was getting ready to preach and my mom gave me a pair of my dad shoes to remember my dad by I took it a step further I started wearing his shoes and I started dressing just like he dressed cuz I thought maybe if I wear his shoes and wear his clothes people like me more if it didn't work they hated me more they were like Paul wear your own shoes I just one night I was so discouraged to get up and preach and even though I knew I had the master key I just felt like I don't have a good word people don't want to hear me then when hear my dad they want to hear some other preacher and got some change the narrative so I wrote down on the snap and I'm here on purpose I'm here I'm here on purpose I stopped right there the enemy of here is there the enemy of here is some place else with someone else doing something else you've been watching too many other people's stories you need to own being right here you are here on purpose what did your mom and dad a janitor and teenager a college students what do you can't pay the bills you are here on purpose because you have a purpose right where you are and I want to shout out those who are serving in the church on any team if you serve any kids are you serving the parking lot where you serve in any Pokemon for the volunteers that make this place happen where you are as bright will talk with you you're here on purpose I started speaking that because the Bible says that life and death is in the power of the tongue the Bible says that we can prophesy over our future when I was young I used to be really wild and crazy I was add and you're like not surprised by that my dad used to put his hand on my head cuz I be like a peaceful peaceful Paul and now I'm peaceful what are you speaking over your children what are you speaking over your future I want the keys to come out cuz I'm almost done right here but I want you to Envision that you're on a field what's what do you see where do you see your life what do you see that's possible because God wants you to get a big Vision he wants you to get a big you were not born with limitations but born with possibilities and you have the master key to start declaring that your best days are still in front of you see I started saying that I started getting our church this and they started saying it I started telling people they ever wanted section see people turn around there was no one in section c when my dad passed thousands of people left the church and I had to start speaking to those empty seats I had to start prophesying someone in that seat somebody that's it because I saw this place being filled with people who needed Jesus can I tell you elevation there's an empty seat at some campus that's waiting for somebody's life to be changed never stop reaching people never stop filling up building never stop inviting your neighbors to somebody's life is waiting on you don't ever get comfortable with where we're at because we have not seen our best days yet elevation we have not seen our greatest Miracles yet you haven't heard the best sermons yet you haven't seen the greatest miracle the best series the best Miracles the best campus beer cuz there's going to be a credible things what the door doesn't open until you unlock it and you got to start declaring you can sit down I promise I landed just a minute while I kiss this Tennessee right now Popeyes will still be open it may not have chicken sandwiches but it will still be open Chick-fil-A on Sunday but you know I one night I was walking and we just had our second baby our finances are in a tough spot as a church right when I stepped in his pasture I begin Pastor in 2014 just five years ago this month and this wealthy man who had left our church he invited me to his office and he said hey I left whenever your dad passed but I'm ready to come back ready to help you with finances to praise God cuz I had to let go of so many people in my dad passed we couldn't afford to pay all these people and I thought I was going to have to close down the college in the school in the camp and I just felt so overwhelmed 28 years old just turned 29 is that time I'm going to help you but I need you to do this this this and this and you begin to list these things I heard God whisper in my heart are you going to trust in man's money are you going to trust in Jehovah Jireh I thought this was a test I thought there was hidden cameras so I looked at the man I said sir thank you for being willing to help cuz he he could have financed the whole thing I mean he was a very wealthy person but I said I can't do those things unless God tells me I'm not going to sell the ministry that the pulpit is not up for prostitution I'm not going to let anyone buy this church for by the decisions of this house but there were no hidden cameras in he never ended up coming panda a year-and-a-half a pass we had her second child and one night I'm walking on this street I come across the bridge it was dark I was discouraged and I just heard that no one cares just in the pants we're living in a time right now we're so many pastors are dealing personally with doubt and discouragement so many young pastors are trying to fill the shoes a pair of tennis I mean y'all need to pray always be praying for the church out there so many people having our world our nation America is on so much medication to try to deal with anxiety and depression and discouragement and I was right there on that bridge and I don't know if I'm speaking to someone is watching this later on it's standing on a bridge but I could hear the enemy just whisper just jumped in the pain Church be better off without you I felt like I was in a basement beneath house but I wasn't just one floor below I was five basements below where I should have been that's the only way I can describe depression is you just too far below where you should be mentally and emotionally but I felt like there was a raindrop coming from Heaven it's like my dad was just dropping Little Raindrops the Bible says train your children up in the way they should go and they will not depart from it never underestimate get your family to church never underestimate City skip your kids and big kids getting your youth the youth group here listen there's something powerful about being raised in in those presence of God in the scriptures and all the sudden started coming on my head you're more than a conqueror you're fearfully wonderfully made you've got what it takes to see the final point of this message is surrender because it was in this moment of surrender you can see it you can serve it you can speak but the final moments that you activate the Keys of
