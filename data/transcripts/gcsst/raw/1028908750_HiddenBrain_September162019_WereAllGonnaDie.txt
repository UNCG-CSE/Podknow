from NPR This is hidden brain I'm Shankar vedantam we begin today with a tan of a man known as a miser a man's soul and moved by the plight of others that he has become synonymous with greed and selfishness his name was Ebenezer Scrooge Scrooge of course with a character in Charles dickens's famous story A Christmas Carol and yes I know it's not Christmas but stay with me a moment did this 1984 film version of the story Scrooge refuses to give money to a charity that's helping the poor public institutions does my badly off let's go there and many would rather die if they would rather die than see a better do so and decrease the Surplus population screwed by someone welcome guess who push him to question his Outlook that goes the first to remind him about his past and present and ask him to embrace the Christmas spirit it's to no avail Scrooge cares more about his money that is community but then he's visited by Third ghost who shows him his future a grave terrified of the prospect of his own death Scrooge bags the ghost to allow him to make amends for his visitation promises to become kind and generous to care about his community to embrace the Christmas spirit moments later he wakes up thank you speech I will keep my promise in the story of Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol as a parable about the dangers of shutting our hearts to other people but there's another lesson that comes from the story it's a lesson about death it was a fear of death that cause cruise to change his ways and there was a great psychological truth in that story menu for shy away from consciously thinking about death but it turns out that still figures in our minds far more often than most of us realize and these thoughts produce an extraordinary range of human responses from the kind and generous to the strange and absurd how thoughts of death shape our lives this week on hidden brain support for NPR comes from National Car Rental who wants you to know that with a membership in our complimentary Emerald Club you can skip the counter and choose any car in the aisle at participating national locations you can even select an upgrade without paying extra learn more at nationalcar.com NPR when Sheldon Solomon was 8 years old his mother told him about death this was the day before of my grandmother died of cancer and I remember my mom saying to me I would say goodbye to Grandma cuz she's very ill and I knew that but then she died the next day and I just remember because I was looking at postage stamps that I collected at the time of Dead Presidents and I was like Wow Washington State Jeffersons dead Grandma step that would all be fine except for me being on deck in the long run his time would also come decades later. Story re-emerging his life he was a young Professor at Skidmore College he was searching for a book in the library when something in the Freud section called is it was a book by a recently deceased cultural Anthropologist Ernest Becker and that one was called the birth and death of meaning then in the first paragraph Becker says I want to understand what makes people act the way they do and I said call me to finally somebody not writing and turgid jargon that's a non pharmacological intervention for insomnia just asking a straightforward question you know what makes people act the way that they do some more books on the shelf by the same author so I grabbed the next book the denial of death and again the first paragraph Becca writes the idea of death the fear of it haunts the human animal like nothing else it is a mainspring of human activity and in my gut that brought me way back to being eight years old I knew that that statement was at the very least true for my own life and I suspected that it was true for most folks as well shut it reached out to two friends Tom Kosinski and Jeff Greenberg like him they were young psychologist all three of them fell in love with his backers books the central idea that captivated them was that people construct mental defenses to ward off the fear of death the three psychologist Road up a paper elaborating on this concept they would eventually call this idea Terror management Theory they sent off that paper to a top Journal certain they were going to rock the world of psychology we didn't hear anything for about six months and then we got the review in the paper was rejected with a one-sentence review the reviewer said something along the lines of I have no doubt that these ideas are of no interest whatsoever to any psychologist alive or dead so this is a bit of a blur Jeff and Tom said oh I don't think they like it be an even more immature than they I said they loved it there just being Coy but it turns out they weren't because the same paper was then rejected at almost every psychology Journal has ran into the president of the American Psychological Association at a conference and the Austin why the paper had been rejected and we just said hi with these are good ideas to which she replied they might be but psychology is an empirical discipline that you guys are experimental psychologists and so why not try to gather evidence in support of backers clients and it was in response to that suggestion that we generated what we called Terror management Theory which is basically just our effort to take all of Becker's ideas in to generate hypotheses that we could subject to empirical scrutiny so is that his work was not empirical he was making claims that he didn't have evidence for he was making these sad these intuitive leaps involving logic and philosophy but they weren't based on on empirical data on experimentation and and you set out to try and fix that one of your first experiments involve judges in Tucson who are dealing with prostitutes tell me about the study and what it found sure certainly so you know what not Shelf with Terror management theory states is that the uniquely human awareness of death gives rise to potentially debilitating existential Terror that we managed hence the term Terror management by embracing culturally constructed belief systems that give us each a sense that life has meaning and we have value as you said what would people said back in the days in the 1980s is well you know this is philosophical and psychoanalytic speculation what we reasoned is that if Becker is right if our beliefs about reality serve to minimize death anxiety let's see what happens if we remind some people of their own mortality because what should happen if they should claim more tenaciously to their beliefs so the first study was done on Municipal Court judges in Tucson Arizona think we had about 30 judges and we randomly divided them into two groups have for the judges were reminded of their mortality by in the middle of a bunch of questionnaires being asked to just write down their thoughts and feelings about their own mortality and then we show them an actual court case of an alleged prostitute which was the most common I'm in Tucson's municipal court at the time and we just ask them well how much bail would you set that's the amount of money that you have to pay to not be imprisoned until your trial so what we found is in the control condition the judges set an average bail of $50 and that was good because that was the average bail for that crime at the time however the judges reminded that they were going to die they set a nine times higher bail an average of $455 in what was astonishing is not only the magnitude of that difference but also the vociferous missive the judges resistance when we told them at the end of the study what we had done they just said there's no way that you're idiot death questionnaire could have in any way altered the way that I have judicate at this particular case I guess the take home messages if you're going to court for a traffic ticket at you better hope that the judge hasn't driven past the cemetery on the way to court that day it might be difficult to see how this is connected to Ernest Packers ideas to let slow down a minute the central idea of Terror management theory is that we cope with the fear of death by constructing mental defenses those defenses Sheldon and his co-authors found time to fall into a couple of patterns the first main line of defense when we are prompted to think about death is to retreat into cultural safe havens all religions our communities our values the idea here is that by emotion ourselves in the language and Norms of our cultural groups we become part of something that is less mortal the groups that will outlive us when the judges were reminded of their mortality baby came in a way more conservative in that morality to punish women who had broken the Norms of that culture of course they could be other explanations for this Behavior so she decided to conduct a new experiment the reason that they were right the same forces driving judges to treat sex workers harshly would also produce another effect when people are reminded of death they should also want to reward those who exemplify the Norms of the community if somebody does something that's in a cord with your belief system then being reminded of death should make you like them more so in a subsequent study we had participants the either think about themselves dying or something unpleasant and then we showed them a newspaper article about a citizen who thwarted a bank robbery and we just ask them what how much monetary reward should the citizen receive in the control condition it was about $1,000 and in the death condition it was over $3,000 so I want to talk about a couple of other studies as well just to lay out the to rain here and what's interesting is that these Studies have been conducted in many different countries are you once asked Germans about the preferences in food cars and vacations and some were interviewed in a retail setting and others were interviewed in front of a cemetery what did you what did you find a great study for a few reasons why we didn't do it and that makes it better because when are the researchers can replicate your findings that's always important for scientific purposes it also use the very clever manipulation and so one way that we remind people that they're going to die is to just ask them how they feel about it a more subtle ways to stop people either in front of a funeral parlor or a hundred me to either side in our thought was that if you're in front of a funeral parlor particularly in Germany where they often have embalmed corpse is in the window what depth should be on your mind even if it's hidden from your own awareness and sure enough Germans reminded of their mortality but, more supportive of buying German Goods they also sit closer to fellow Germans and further away from other folks who look like Turkish immigrants so one of the things that I think would surprise people is not the thesis that death is terrifying by the idea that the terror of death has such widespread ramifications and effect in our lives and I'm wondering if you can just addressed as in some ways it is a form of criticism of your theory that it's one thing to say yes you know we have concerns about death but how do you go from there to saying that this actually has a profound role in almost everything that we think sand do you know people dismissed backer for being brought to the point of grandiose when he said that anxiety about the is essentially the central driver of what it is that motivates us as human beings when you talk to people about backers ideas will be like this is crazy I don't think about death all the time and Becker's for you is that you don't think about death all the time because you're comfortably embedded in cultural worldview in a way that buffers you from death anxiety by virtue of the fact that you feel like you're a person of value in a world of meaning the idea here is that even though the anxiety about death is ever-present we are largely oblivious to it because our mental defenses are strong we sued ourselves with our anthems and our rituals and our conviction that our religion is the best when were these defenses are breached is when we come into contact with people different than us people who have their own beliefs now we must either accept our beliefs are just that beliefs or we must try to establish that our beliefs are better if your beliefs about reality serve to minimize death anxiety well then when you run into somebody who has different that's a problem because if I accept let's say the Fool on a and Molly who say the Earth was created out of a giant drop of milk well that undermines the veracity of the judeo Christian account that we're God created heaven and earth than 6 days what Becker said therefore is that when we encounter people who are different we tend to belittle them we tend to try to convince or coerce them to dispose of their ideas where we just kill him that that's proving that our God are ideas or better after all funny comeback we explore how these ideas play out in politics support for hidden brain and

death by clinging more tightly to aspect of that culture and Solomon and other Terror management Theory won't you find the people have a second kind of response to the fear of death they find ways to boost their own self esteem besides saying my culture is superior my nation is the best my religion is the most profound they also say I'm the best I'm better looking than other people I'm smarter I'm richer we call it self esteem striving and so for example I think the first study of was by Ora Rita Topman been already been is real and the participants were Israeli soldiers and they measure the extent to which the soldiers self-esteem was based on their driving prowess I don't know if you've been to Israel but they are very maniacal Taylor Swift love and respect and then they put them on a driving simulator they measured how fast and how recklessly the soldiers drove and Gambit good news is in the control condition of the soldiers drove quite modestly when they were reminded of their mortality first the soldiers whose self-esteem was based on their driving skills they drove faster and more recklessly other Studies have shown that skin divers reminded of their mortality they say they would stay underwater in more dangerous whether or when they were running out of oxygen up people who value their basketball skills when they're reminded of their mortality they actually shoot better at the foul line people that think they're strong if you give them something to squeeze when you remind them of their mortality they actually squeeze harder so these are just different them and striations that we sure up our self-esteem in response to existential anxieties in the skin divers and the Israeli drivers are where reminders of mortality cause people to act in ways that increase the risk for mortality a poignant we wrote a book chapter wants death can be hazardous to your health and our point was very simply that because our primary goal psychologically is to maintain a sense of meaning and value there are times when we will do that even at the expense of our physical safety so one of the studies that our students Jamie Goldberg and Jamie aren't did is really remarkable where they showed that when people in Florida whose self-esteem dependent on their appearance in a world where being tan is considered beautiful one of those folks were reminded of their mortality a few minutes later when they were asked oh next time you go to the beach how long will you stay in the Sun and what kind of sunscreen will you use will those folks said they would stay out longer and use weaker sunscreen so here they are trying to boost self-esteem and a way that could ultimately terminate them with cancer sites in in in these studies is that what we're really trying to avoid is actually not death but the fear of death and it's interesting and instructive that you've named your theory Terror management Theory supposed to death management Theory it's not about avoiding that it's about avoiding the fear of death yes I think you're quite right but In fairness to Becker he says at the beginning of the den if that death is in fact a complex multi-dimensional construct and people fear it he claimed we all do but we may fear it for different reasons and there is good evidence to suggest that for some it it's really not the prospect of being dead the Real Horror is it is to be privy to the moments when were in the process of that transition itself Dorado Rochester dying not the debt that actually is a source of Matera yes at least I think that's the case for me although that there are times when I think I don't know I really don't want to have it both ways that I don't want to be dead or be dying but I like I do I am compelled by the I think it's the epicureans who said well you know there were people here for eons before we got here and nobody's ever worried about that but almost every one of us has a hard time imagining a world in the future that wouldn't include us and why should that bother us yeah I think about it when I'm really dead that won't bother me so much it's the getting there in first place what is Terror management Theory predict about the kind of leaders that we are drawn to Charlotte yester management theory predicts that when existential anxiety are aroused that we are more likely on when I say we I mean all of us are more likely to embrace what the sociologist Max Weber called a charismatic leader in the aftermath of September 11th we argued based on our studies but it was our own existential anxiety that attracted Americans to President Bush 12 with a good weight loss fast forward 2 2015 2016 and Donald Trump declare his candidacy for the presidency and look up illegal swarms are coming over the southern border sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us terrorists are going to come into the United States and they're going to kill us and he said look I am the only one who can keep you safe I'm going to make America great again so we did studies in 2015 and 16 American respondents reminded of death or more supportive of President Trump now President Trump and said they were more likely to vote for him when they were reminded of their mortality when it became evident the Donald Trump was running against Hillary Clinton we found the respondents preferred Clinton to Trump in a psychologically benign state of mind but if they were reminded of their mortality first their enthusiasm and support for President Trump was substantially increased and then moreover we did other studies where we showed that just asking an American to think about a mosque being built in their neighborhood or an immigrant moving into their Town thought that that was sufficient to make unconscious death thoughts come more readily to mind and that in turn increased support for now President Trump this is important because the President Trump doesn't have death reminders in his rallies and so one might wonder well how is this a practical significance well the fact is that he doesn't have to just keeping immigration and terrorism and the idea that the Chinese and every other country for the most part are a mortal threat to us by virtue of their aggressive Trade Practices all of that whether the president is aware of it or not serves to maintain a high level of death anxiety and that in turn serves to maintain greater support for a charismatic leader this seems to be so much in the current political moment that reflect some of the themes that we've talked about that when I think about partisanship for example I think of people who want to stick to that try because the tribe has long offer protection against death another threat absolutely we are fundamentally tribal animals for better and worse and what's problematic and potentially catastrophic not to sound too histrionic but we're at a point where we have lost track of our overriding commonality As Americans and up this does run the risk of our partisan identities if push comes to proverbial shove taking precedent over what's best for us as citizens of the country itself you've done some work looking at how liberals and conservatives behave toward one another in an experiment that involves hot sauce tell me about that study so we had liberal and conservative participants who thought they were working with a liberal or conservative partner and then they learn that their partner didn't like spicy foods and they were told well okay you're going to eat some crackers and rate how you like them and your partner's going to eat some hot sauce and you get to determine how much hot sauce they're going to have to eat and they have to eat all of it and then rate how pleasant it was art show in the control condition it didn't matter whether the person you were working with shared your beliefs or not you gave him the same amount of hot sauce on the other hand if you were were reminded of dying first you gave the same amount of sauske the partner if they shared your politics but if they didn't you gave them twice as much and we can confirm that this was an aggressive reaction by talking to the participants afterwards they didn't know that it had anything to do with being reminded of their mortality up but when we said did you know that you were essentially dosing these folks because they didn't like hot sauce there like You're darn right we are I'm wondering what it's like for you personally Sheldon do I spend so much of your career thinking about a cheery topic like that I had to change the way you thought about immortality yourself I would like to think so but I can't say for sure we weave meaning Jeff and Tom and I have joked but quite seriously that Terror management theory has spared us without the necessity of directly confronting our own existential anxiety Speakers by turning it into an intellectual exercise really does distance us a bit like this like that coming along and that I'm a little bit more accurate in my own self Reflections when I ask myself from time to time why are you doing things is it is it just to feel better about yourself in order to manage anxiety or is this something that we're genuinely represents directions that I would like to take for their own sake so I hope I'm making progress Sheldon Solomon is a psychology professor at Skidmore College along with Jeff Greenberg and Tom Kosinski he's the co-author of the worm at the core on the role of death in life and thank you for joining me at Hidden brain
