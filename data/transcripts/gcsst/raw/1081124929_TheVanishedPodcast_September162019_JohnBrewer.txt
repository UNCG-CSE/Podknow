I'm a fan of the vanished podcast sometimes I will listen to the podcast while I'm working and I like oh Polly who did this or you know you have it ball and you know that everybody else knows who did it but you just can't prove it and it's just so that it's 2019 and people get away with murder you drink that as much as technology and forensics work that is done and how they can take one drop of blood and figure out who it is a miraculous advancement that we've made and people are getting away with murderI feel like the mental illness piece of it is downplaying the year that he was captain of the sheriff's department and what they borrowed body enforcer within the city and helps make sure that people were fake and I feel like that's all just no one cares. That should get him special treatment at all the fact that he has a mental illness should not be just that he gets discarded as a human beingmy sisters and I were not close our dad in the last year's feels like to know what happened to him we want closure he was in telegram I feel like 3 months prior to my dad says dipiero's there is a woman in Nashville he was picked up in a cab and she was found dead the next morning on the side of the road she's been run over what they think by the cab taxi driver is involved the last person who saw hima May 8th 2013 69 year old John Brewer left his

ADT real protection years prior to his disappearance John Brewer had retired from his career as a captain in the Davidson County Sheriff's Department in the Years leading up to his disappearance John's mental health began to deteriorate two years before he disappeared in a delusional State John believe that he was the US Marshal and that is neighbor was a fugitive he broke into his neighbor's home and try to arrest him John was charged with aggravated assault aggravated kidnapping and violation of a protective order John went to court and the judge sentenced him to reside at a state mental health facility the judge believed that a mental health facility could better care for his needs and living independently or going to prison the mental health facility eventually transition him to a nearby halfway house and this is where he was living when he disappeared due to his mental health issues John's relationships with his daughters had to tear they now know that this estrangement was caused by his mental health issues we spoke to John's daughter's Glenda and Brandy for the story they told us about their father and what they were members of his life here is Glenda I'm his daughter I'm in May 3 years later and then 14 and 1/2 years later they had Brandy and it gets worse are middle names rhyme as well Linda and I were both so adamant when Brandi when my mom was going to have Brandi we were like absolutely her name has to be something completely different you cannot do no name her anything related to Linda or Glenda so my dad he had nine brothers and sisters and my dad lost his dad when he was 4 years old he got killed in a car wreck here in Nashville and so my grandmother had all these babies and then she remarried they struggled they didn't have a lot even as a young teenager he works he worked on a farmer's truck he was selling produce whatever job he could get he would do my dad was one of nine my mother was one of 16 and so there were lots of mouths to feed and both of them came from families that had very little very rich in love and the non-material thing that really struggled when it comes to closing the kids providing for the kids sake bike that both of my parents had very strong work ethic for me growing up my parents were very hard worker they made for that we had our house was one of the nicer houses on our block we had all kinds of toys I would stay above and beyond what you'd like for your birthday over and beyond that always make sure that we had everything that we needed so much to the point that even Linda had a really close friend and school whose parents were much older and they were on a fixed income and so whenever we would want to do something and we would want our friends to go our parents would pay for our friends to go as well my dad was really strict on us growing up we were very respectful to our elders we always said yes sir no sir they wanted to ensure that we had really good morals and respect that we knew right from wrong my dad being in law enforcement you know he always made sure that if there was a lesson you know that we needed and I know he told us growing up the earlier part of my childhood I mean he was strict that he was a very loving dad John and his wife eventually divorced leaving Young Brandy in the middle of a custody dispute Glenda told us about the strange turns the custody dispute took time as I got older my my parents separated when I was about 14 or 15 my dad was having an affair with Monica he told us he was going to go work on a roofing job in another city and then he just never came back so after he and my mom divorced he married Monica they lived in Pegram as my little sister Brandy yeah my mom died and I thought my dad for custody of Brandy and he won and then he turned around and gave custody give her back to me and I think he was having mental issues back then get a hot start 2020 and we knew it was like what has this person been to speaking with Brandy we asked her to tell us about her childhood as she remembers it with my dad is very very different from my sister because of the age difference I don't remember him as a child he had basically taken off and started packing up with my stepmother so I remember he called me and then outside of that I didn't see him again until I was 10 I took my mom to court and has visitation setup through the court because I did not know him the judge in Nashville like a ramp up where you know he didn't get Friday to Sunday right off there yet it was I got to go I went to church with them on Sundays he would bring me home at dinnertime and then it was overnight and then it was the full every other weekend black mesh non-custodial parents have my mom got sick in Gina's 95 and then she passed away in August of 95 and in the state of Tennessee when you have split custody situation and one parent passes away custody typically automatically revert to the other parent June 1st of 96 until sometime in July 96 I lived with him full-time I guess you could say it sounds like 20/20 looking back and being an adult I can see where the mental illness with starting to show itself really irrational things he would make me do like he would have me load wood in the back of a dump truck in this thing is I got it. The way he had asked for it he would go and push the button and buffalo wild, do it again my relationship with him was never good I will call on more than one occasion telling him if you love me cuz he would tell me he loved me and I'll tell you know if you love me the way that you say you do you will drop off and you will never you will never seek me out and I was 12 years old telling them that my dad called my sister at work and said you know if you give me your part of what you thought from your mom has custody and so that's how my sister came to be my guardian so she raised me and then all through my teens over here that he was going to show back up again hindsight 20/20 after the divorce genre married a woman named Monica who was also a law enforcement officer and they seemed happy together however as John's mental health worsened his life started to spiral downward Glenda told us about some of the things going on in John's life at the time of his disappearance I think that there was some drinking and some over-medicating going on and they would get into the fight and Monica were arguing fighting the she had him arrested he went to live with his friend GT and Ben who Barry and so he stayed with them for a while then actually told me that he had seen them fighting before and that Monica had knocked the crap out of Johnny and basically knocked him out of a chair for my dad was just put to 250 and she's about six foot or so maybe 300 I mean I don't know if he did hit her I can tell you that my parents were married 2420 they got into some pretty heated argument but I never in my entire life. My dad's a a finger on my mother never had to leave because she got a restraining order against them so he missed to Ben and Judy to bury they notice that he was acting very weird and strange though he was there a little while and they were like this is not really working you're going to have to move on so then he rented a room from one of his friends in East Nashville and then somehow he wound up in a condo in Madison Tennessee which is a suburb of Nashville at the condo his mental illness was getting really worse and worse enforcement for a long time finished with law enforcement and wasn't working at 70 the belt like that that he was a u.s. marshal okay he was convinced that he was a u.s. marshal and he thought the neighbor across the hall from him was doing something illegal so she goes over to the neighbors pulled a gun on the neighbor it's a blessing that he did not hurt the neighbor or that the neighbor didn't kill him because the neighbor was able to pull his shirt over his head and get the gun away from him and get away from him and call the police when he got arrested is when he got arrested for that he went and did they did a mental evaluation and they determined that he had to go to Middle Tennessee Mental Health you know the resolution to those charges the neighbor agreed this guy is mentally ill and he 70 you know you're the loader 68 or however old he was at the time that he didn't need to go to prison he needed to go get mental help part of the plea deal of those charges with they bundled the charge from Monica into all of that was that he be remanded to Middle Tennessee mental health so he went to middle Tennessee mental health he was there for a while he was put on medications very strong psychotic medications after an amount of time he was released to a group home and he lives at that great time with my aunt as his conservator she would go and visit him and take care of him and get everything that he needed and so he's lived there for a while and then she told me that he has been sent back to Middle Tennessee mental health stay there for a little while they determine that he could once again go to a group home as I mentioned earlier John has been living in a halfway house after having been in a residential mental health facility Glenda walked us through the events of the day that he disappeared regards to the group home there on Jefferson Street lb Jackson he's there may be a week and then it's a date and he either flag down a yellow cab Yellow Cab somehow or another in a Yellow Cab according to the employee who was working there now he's got his wits about him to know my money is at Community Bank & Trust in Pegram Tennessee he takes a taxi to the bank he goes into the bank he called me some sort of test because they questions bank account the next day but he does then he withdraws $500 that's not all the money he has in his account at first he only wanted like two or three hundred and then he decided he wanted 500 so he withdraws $500 he goes back out he gets a cab is never seen again never seen anywhere don't want to do the right things to keep our bodies healthy in the long run but even if we try really

vanished according to John's family he had been diagnosed with grandiose delusion disorder and this may explain some of the events that took place on the last day that he was seen Glenda and her sisters were concerned after this incident but because they've been estranged from their father for so long they weren't sure if he was actually missing or if he had just fallen out of contact my sisters and I we were estranged from our dad because of the situation with Brandy and me having to fight him for custody getting her back the whole deal and so my aunt she was taking care of my dad and so she tells us that he's missing my aunt is actually on the news he has missing on like a Tuesday or Wednesday my hand is on the news within a couple of days because she is very worried about the community she's afraid that he's going to think he's a u.s. marshal and try to hurt somebody so the group told my aunt that they made a missing person report my aunt called the police again and was like you don't understand he is a brat he could hurt someone I don't want him to hurt anybody you guys have got to find him and her sister started searching for their dad they kept running into frustrating roadblocks when it came to John's wife Monica after he's missing Monica is she is trying to divorce him okay we are going to probate court because that's where his conservatorship is that's where the divorce is taking place they moved it all under one judge here in Nashville Tennessee to do that and she managed to get his widow's pension which I'm not sure how that's going to work cuz she's not a widow anymore when he's declared ad every single thing she got the house outright she got every personal belonging that he had all the money in his account so the court in and getting the divorce the court said well it's to everybody's benefit to find him so let's hire a private investigator to look for him his conservatorship will pay half and Monaco should pay half because you know it's her benefit to find them so she can get her divorce it was very difficult because you know she Monica is a former sergeant of the Metro Nashville Police Department police officer a lot of the private investigators around here or former metro police officers might be a former metro police officer to investigate him being missing and looking for him and so we finally agreed upon instigator the private investigator does a little bit of pronoun preliminary work and then all the sudden he tells me that he can't you know I called to see where he is with his investigation and he says why I can't speak to you I can only speak to your aunt aunt that the work has been halted by the attorney and so it's been a year to get the private investigator to look for him and try to find him he finds no trace of them where his wife is trying to get a divorce from her missing husband John's family discovered that no police report had ever been filed in 2013 when John had disappeared he has a attorney that for the conservatorship who's helping my aunt look out for his best interest and in a discussion with the attorney my aunt is older and so my aunt didn't email and in a really text much during this time it was a struggle to get the attorney to respond a lot of time my aunt would call me I would email him and say hey but this is what she wants to know and so he would respond cuz then I would call her and you know read her the email during that time he called me the attorney and he said there is no missing person report for your dad I said you got to be kidding me and he said no he said I just checked there's no missing person report and I said filed a missing-person report at Mary called the police again because she was worried I said they know he's missing because you're going to have to call and get a missing-person report. My Aunt Mary called the police they came over they refuse to take a report because it had been three years at that time I turned around and I emailed the chief of police of Nashville Steve Anderson and said hey we have a problem here he's missing no one even made a report or looking for him or anything and So within 30 minutes of Sergeant called me and read me instructions on this is how you get the police report filed give them his name make sure they understand he's aware and he wanted me to call him back if they would not take the report we finally got them to take the report so in 2016 they took the missing person report successfully filed a police report with local authorities they wanted to know what was going on in the investigation to find John but the police were reticent to give out any information this was Metro Nashville Police Department because he was losing on Jefferson Street in Nashville Davidson County we wait a little bit we wait a month we don't hear anything from them my sisters and I start calling them just say hey what what is going on here we go down to the police department Brandy and I give a DNA sample to be loaded into naming so that if he comes up there will be something the match to the police department said they had gone back and look through all their missing person report to make sure it didn't get put in the wrong so that it wasn't somewhere it shouldn't have been they could not find the report and we're like we don't understand how this could be I even asked them I figured the great time probably had a lot of calls from the police department just because of the nature of the people live in their home out in the suburbs for probably 40 years and I knew I'm like I don't know that she's really ever called the police and so I said can you do a reverse search on my aunt address and you should see where the police were called to her home in May of 2013 and that you can see who the police officer was that she said she gave the report they came back and they said we have no record of a call at that address in 2013 they only had one other call and it was something about her neighbor had asked her to call the Play Store no record of the 2013 and she said they came and sat in my living room to them they were here it's just very bizarre things have happened three years had gone by that time and no one had even looked at any of the cab companies said anything about it we were starting from way behind to begin unfortunately that detective the missing person detective who was assigned to my dad's case was about four or five weeks away from retirement he knew some of my aunts and uncles on my mother's side and so I said I was like oh my God she's going to help us there's going to be you know we're going to find some answers and we literally had to say could you please the bank that they take a report they won't give us the report could you please go and get the report could you please check these things and so I don't think anything at all was done on that has Tay John's family continues to remain suspicious of some of his wife's actions it's important to remember that everyone handles tragedy differently but I also found some of those things odd myself we continue to go to court because Monica she still want the restraining order she still is going through trying to divorce my dad so we're kind of dealing with that we found out that the detective he did retired police department my sisters and I contact detective Dolly and we go and meet with him and he basically says there really isn't anything we can do it unless there's a body nothing we can do and if we find anything we'll give you a call but he also said this is really Cheatham County this year so all this time has gone by you all took the report told you we knew exactly where he went missing crime we told you there was no secret that it was in paper and which is in Cheatham County and stuff now it's well if you should really have reported this to Cheatham County my sister my older sister Linda and my cousin go to Cheatham County to try to do a missing person report they would not do a missing-person report or talk to it they're like no this is not no we're not we're not doing it I thought I actually get her divorce she got everything my dad we asked about cadaver dogs going to their property because again it's six miles from the bank the day he went missing from the Monica told my Aunt my aunt called Monica as a courtesy to tell her hey he's missing and she said I know it the back called me the bank had called her to let her know that he was missing but she knew that he was at that bank she's gotten everything in the divorce she's getting the Widow's pension she financially gained from that she never called my aunt to say has he been found has anybody heard anything I mean you're terrified of him to the point that you've got a restraining order against them but she never inquires as to what the situation is is he has he been found is he back in the hospital she never never calls and never asked as a matter of fact my dad's best friend was probably black when he is Friday Blackwood and Friday was the head of the Davidson County Sheriff's Office the jail where my dad was the captain and they've been friends for a million years but I don't remember much time in my life that Friday wasn't my Dad's friend okay it's looking for my dad he said she would have called me he would have come to me had he decided to leave the group home if he had his fence about him enough to know where his money was to go to his bank if he had that much it's about him he said he would have called me Friday called Monica several times to try to get the address of a Monica had a cabin in Paris Tennessee that her aunt and uncle had left her will to her something and I would go to that cabin periodically wanted to go up and searched and look around the sign when Friday was trying to reach her Friday said the guy said he was like us attorney called him and said why are you trying to reach her and he said I want the address of the cabin I'm trying to find Johnny and the guy said will let me talk to her I'll call you back and he calls back and he says she doesn't want you on her property and she said that you need to stop looking for Johnny and he told me he told me this out of his second half Sports head I called and talked to him and he said something bad has happened because your dad would have contacted me never we're now at 6 years nobody really ever looked for him nobody really done anything no matter it seems like no matter how hard we try no one is really interested he's had two sisters died a brother die if he were somewhere that he he would have died at something while speaking with Brandy she also recalled some of Monica's behavior that she found unsettling have a news article suspected these now by homeowner retired officer and it's copy written in 2013 which is the year of my dad disappeared what started out as an attempt to steal a metal roof from an abandoned home ended with the suspects in the back of a Metro patrol car Monica jet a retard Place metro police officer has owned the four-year she live down the road from the property that was awarded to this E5 concerned neighbor she immediately retrieve it so the article goes down but basically she held these men at gunpoint until the police came and this was the same year that my dad disappeared so she still had that that cop mentality and so I wholeheartedly believe that she could have laughing she could have gotten rid of his body by herself know my dad built the house that she lives in the house I don't mean he didn't paid someone to build it built it and so one of the things that he was so proud of what looked out over the only thing I can think of was if she got rid of him by herself if she pissed him off the deck in the back and let the Animals still play with when she was trying to divorce him to me he was trying to divorce him the judge said you know I really want mr. Brewer to come and speak for himself so we're going to actively search for him and we're probably investigator in so one more tired and I have spoken to him multiple times and he did a cadaver dogs at the time we thought she is three Parcels of land in a row it was our understanding that they talked to him after the fact about a year later and he said no it was just one partial it was only the partial that her house is sitting on when he was doing his investigating by Cameron and her home concerts that I don't think she did like a formal interview with her she kept talking about this mail and of material in the basement and he said it was in it was a powder and I told him three different time since he did his investigation about that mound and this last time I talked to him I talked to him a couple weeks back and I said is there any way my Dad could have been in that mouth and he said as big as the mountain ask him what that mound was and he just says it's some kind of a building substance he doesn't know what it was he thinks it might be bagged concrete it's not labeled my stepmother had told him that there was something my dad had a real witch. Sound like Kim and bothers me even in light of some of these bizarre events we asked Linda if she thinks it's possible that her dad could be out there alive somewhere possibly living among the homeless this is what she said. They might have harmed themselves but if he did it's not like he could have hid his body afterward you know what I mean he would have been whatever he fell and he would have been discovered by now say this taxi driver is involved I mean that's the last person I called him and if he knew he got money as he knew he got $500 out of the bank or some amount of money out of the bank she knew that my dad had money so if he harmed my dad for the money then what did he do with his body I mean at some point a hunter a surveyor this is been long and I that he would have been found $500 is long gone he doesn't have any meds and people like what maybe he's homeless and living on the street and I'm like being home with my dad was very smart the whole nother level I feel very very strong again my dad 6 to 2:50 I feel like if he were home he would have been called and arrested by now because I feel like if someone would have anything that belong to him steal from each other all the time if anybody has touched his belongings he would have tried to kill him and I feel like he would have called a run test somewhere and he would have been arrested by now sleep number is the official sleep and

gravitas movies.com and news code vanished 3 years have passed before the police department took a missing persons report and John's family is understandably frustrated with the delayed investigation and has focused instead on their own search here's Glenda's take there's a whole different Whatley way I could go with this and tell you that three months prior to my dad's disappearance there is a woman in Nashville he was picked up in a cab and she was found dead the next morning on the side of the road she's been run over what they think by the cat the case has been very much mishandled but one thing that came out of that is her family fault with the the Metro Council here in the End Nashville and they got the law changed so that every cab have to have a GPS and be tried and that went into right after my dad disappeared nobody cared enough to pee this case and my dad came and what else back during that time to all the cabs were inspected all of the it was up to every cab company to make sure you keep ya ass and so what the really sad part is is here three years went by when nothing not one thing being done and can't go by and get that back cuz you can say that long and then to the fact that it's like okay we're there you know they kept saying he got into a Yellow Cab so the yellow cab companies in town had a already implemented the GPS or haddock not gone into place yet where they monitoring do they have a record now in 2016 we did we contacted all the cab company the first they said it was a Yellow Cab why cab so we just contact as many cab companies work but we're here and nobody had a record of chica a pick-up at 2400 Jefferson Street Glenda acknowledges that the local law enforcement agencies are doing some work on the investigation submitted to try to talk to their compliance officer but I'm not sure if that's her trial or not but they had said we we did a report the day he came in and I can't remember they close to his bank account the very next day and mailed a check to buy an for what was left in his bank account because he apparently call picture right cuz in the bank detective Miller Ken Miller who is a detective with the Cheatham County Sheriff's Office well the bank told them that they need a subpoena to release the report he says okay penis time he delivers it to the bank and then my sister calls and says do you have the report cuz we are just waiting on bated breath about what's in the report he says they have 30 days to act on it and the girls going on vacation and we'll get it literally the bank waited 20 bus days to hand that over everything because they did not hand over the letter showing they close but they handed over what some emails about one person's account of what happened and how he came in and he asked for Vicki and he had no expression on his face they didn't say one thing about him yelling out making a scene or anyting expressionless and he wanted a withdrawal and then he ask her can she take him somewhere and she told him no and it's like we asked him where he wanted to go did they see him leave the bank and get back in the cab and then he left so it's really weird because the bank then hire off-duty Queen Anne County sheriff's officer Brandon the bank cuz they're afraid he's going to come back one thing that has come up and has given them a little bit of Hope is that a credit report on John showed activity after he was last seen well they said we showed some activity with a utility and 2016 and it was connected to an address in Nashville that my dad was not connected to it to our knowledge at all through some detective work my sisters and I have been able to figure out it was a cell phone there's no active cell phone with that social today but you know I think maybe they tried to do one in 2016 I'm not sure do to jurisdictional issues John's case was eventually transferred from Metro PD the department that John's wife had worked for to Cheatham County after hearing the family's account of what the investigation into finding John has entailed we contacted the Cheatham County Sheriff's office to see if we could speak to detective Miller he agreed and we were able to ask some of the questions that came up when we are researching this case my name is Lieutenant Kenneth Miller and I am the criminal investigation division of the Cheatham County Sheriff's Office work on anything I have with County myself I have four I have for investigators for a county of approximately 42000 people I am we pretty much for everything from child abuse child sex abuse rapes burglaries robberies aggravated assault homicides to the door we we pretty much all have to work we were first contacted back by actually the medical examiner's office out of Nashville I'd received a phone call from them explained to me that this family was wanting to get in touch with us and asked if they could because of their father missing and I don't know if you're familiar with the name is program they were contacting the medical examiner's office about that because of some unidentified that are currently at the medical examiner's office so they wanted to contact us as well because mr. Brews actually last scene and may of 2013 at a bank in my County there was some sort of that's one of the disputes going on here the family believes that there was a more the bank has said some things documented in their emails if they know their inner inner departmental emails they sent out there was some sort of a disturbance at the bank mr. Burger came in to withdraw some money one of the tellers at the time stated that he in the email that you know he was just stupid looking at her funny he was kind of loud and he demanded it only speak with his particular Taylor septic Four Towers actually busy with somebody else if he was eventually able to speak with her they conducted their business he withdrew $500 from his account and wanted somebody to give him from the bank to give him a ride when nobody from blank was able to or willing to see got back into the cab that he came there in and left they actually dispatched an officer out that day and one of the things in the initial report adoption went out back in May of 2013 they called it in that he had shown up at the bank ask an employee for a ride they had heard he had escaped from a mental spell and that's why they call for an officer and it says the sister and then a little bit later than that says the sister just called they were looking for him and he walked away from his group home that was about it. My officers got there they had about a see how about a 10 minute response time and by the time they got on saying he was already gone one thing we wanted to ask detective Miller was if there were any court or medical records so I could give us some insight into John state of mind on the day he disappeared those records are pretty difficult to obtain and not knowing what hospital he's been in or anything of that it's kind of theirs Nashville has quite a few hospitals that will deal with psychiatric patients and they're very protective of those records for good reason I have not been able to get anybody to verify for sure which hospital he was in or be willing to share any information on the new health records it is powerful thing it is a good thing but at times it is just a shield if they were actually in the facility we can get a court order to get some information but there's still some of it that I just will not release as I take us to court I mean and I've actually had them tell me that something might live. Of court order says it will take us to court turn evil talk to your attorney whatever the judge says will do but I'm not going to release information and I have to say yes ma'am thank you Brenda mention that a routine check of John social security number showed that it had been used open up a utility after the time he was last seen we asked detective Miller what that means and if there's any significance to it still getting mail at that address or somebody is just continuing a utility like a trash service that's very common some people we get the trash service a certain address to the trash company really doesn't care who's paying whose names on the bill as long as they're getting their check every month I've run into that crowd off inspection like we do the same kind of searches when we're looking for fugitives with warrants in a way that we will conduct the same same things credit checks so weak we get the Marshal Service or we get IRS EIC or we use a lot of different resources to try to see what we can find and I've used most of those to try to find him as well as just short of you know because he doesn't have a criminal warrant I'm limited in what I can do on some of those databases because I have to be for criminal reasons it did show on the credit report that sometime after his disappearance there was a Verizon account opened but I've not been able to get a lot of information from that at this time how many stories that I've covered We are family and law enforcement alike share frustrations about how difficult it is to get things like phone records detective Miller told us more about that one of the things we deal with us on this and then we deal with this for a lot of different reasons it is a privacy issue you're guaranteed the right to privacy and then to conduct your own business in your own Affairs in in the United States of America without any kind of government intervention phones are part of that your phone records who owns the phone who makes phone calls you know we have to so I could we do everybody is under this misconception that we can just tap iPhone and listen to phone calls most people don't realize how many steps have to go through to even get attempt to talk to a judge about seeing about a wiretap and then to do that is so many more steps you have to follow so many procedures you know every every call has to be documented in monitor it is a nightmare it is a league paperwork not wear for a cell phone records I can get basic information off of a Judicial subpoena that means I have to get a judge to sign off on a order to say hey give him this information then once I get that information then I have to go to a search warrant to obtain specific information about a specific time frame or a specific account number or GPS location all of those have to actually come through search warrant and search warrants or they're a little more details of a lot more specific and a lot more narrow in the scope of what you're allowed to get when we spoke detective Miller shared his goals for finding John even though there are some jurisdictional complications help the family get some get some closure get some answers I'm in bed that's what we've been trying to do to this point our hearts go out to them because we're we're all family people as well and we do this job because we care it's not a it's not about money it's about power it's not about any of that it's it's about we we do care about people and we really want to try to help them and I've been doing stuff for the Brewer family as I can but I have a full case load of things that I have to do if people that I'm actually responsible for in my County one of the things that that's really kind of odd in this particular case is the house that Mr be released on his driver's license is actually physically in Davidson County but because the property line touches the Cheatham County property line at some point in I'm in history they have display decided that they assess the property in Cheatham County so that's another complication in this case that's what Davidson County says what is assessed and cheat on them we're not sure that we should be working it and we run into the same situation here because jurisdiction Ali if unless I find something has happened to him here in Cheatham County you know I find a a deceased person matching him no more I find a scene or have somebody that lives here in Cheatham County that admit say I did this in Chatham County I'm not going to have jurisdiction either it's kind of that borderline thing you know which side of the line was it on when it happened the other issue is what was his actual legal residence because at the time he was supposed to have been staying in a halfway house it's my understanding off of Jefferson Street in Nashville and that is in downtown Nashville is that was his residence at the time to nap kind of takes all question out of it but we can't really confirm that for another cuz that business places since went out of business and you can't find any records from that five spoke with it and dash Nashville investigator that was hit with is assisted them to a point and he was kind of kind of running into the same wall that we're running into but it's not a crime to just decide you don't want to talk anymore and and that's sad but because of his mental mental capability at the time of what we've been told his mental capability was at the time that might should have been handled a little differently at that time when I get involved in it you know almost 6 years later it's kind of I really don't have anything fresh to run with it's a little harder for me to do much more than what I'm doing with all the information I have at this time and Tennessee's laws on mental health are some of the more lenient car that is because you can't tell somebody forever just because they have a mental illness is it terrible to somewhat care for themselves then then they're allowed to go live as normal a life as they're capable of then I don't know that that's a good thing or a bad thing I'm kind of on the fence about that because I have cases like this for somebody that it appears to have had a serious breakdown but he was physically able to someone care for himself maybe not in the best capacity that he was able to somewhat care for himself and make some decisions at that point it's up to the again we go back to the the the court system and all the family would have to take him to court and get him proved to be incompetent for lack of better words before they could start forcing him to either maintain treatment maintain a certain residents or certain lifestyle finally we asked detective Miller what anyone with information about John's disappearance should do please reach out to either the family or myself and Ken Miller I'm with the Cheatham County Sheriff's Office and my phone number is area code 615-792-2021 so at this point if somebody has Anonymous information please share it with just want to get some answers for mr. Brews family but ideally we hope to find him alive and well somewhere and just saying you know I just needed to check out for a little while and get myself back together that's how I deal perfect solution to this but if it's something else then we we at least need to get them to answer so they can have some closure like I can't begin to imagine how hard it is to not know what happened to your loved one I just I can't I can't even begin to so what happened to John Brewer on May 8th 2013 we know that he went to the bank and the bank says that he left in a cap well at the bank he took out $500 what was that money for and where was he going when he left did he go visit his wife who live just miles from the bank and something happened has she shared everything she knows with law enforcement we know that John's Behavior at the bank was alarming to the employees did he have a medical or mental health event and just hasn't been found where did John Brewer just walk away and decide to start over it's hard to guess what was going through John's mine that day we don't know what his mental state was like this story is such a mystery with so few Clues as to what happened to him on that day after he left the bank a lot of time was lost with him not being reported missing until 3 years after he was last seen and there's another mystery within that mystery the halfway house said that they reported him missing to Metro PD the same Department that his wife had worked for his sister had called metro PD and they came out to her house and spoke with her but somehow all evidence of him being reported back in 2013 including the report from the halfway house a call from his sister and the report from investigators who sat down with his sister like John disappeared at the time of his disappearance John Brewer was 69 years old he is approximately 6 ft tall and weighing about 215 lb he has gray hair and brown eyes he may be in need of medical attention if you have any information about The Disappearance of John Brewer you're urged to call the Cheatham County Sheriff's Office at 615-792-2021 you can follow the search for John on social media at missing John Adam Brewer we have a Facebook page we're constantly every time there's a body that shows up or remain bones where we all these are calling people looking trying to find out in a weapon situation is Robert Quinn laughing my father in law enforcement I know I know it's a dangerous job there so many sacrifices but at the end of the day I'm just like you failed you are here to investigate the problem this is a sad situation for the family and I do feel for them and I do understand their frustration and they ain't even at times or animosity I can't tell him that they're wrong for feeling the way they are that's that's all right that brings us to the end of episode 191 I'd like to thank everyone who spoke with us if you're of a missing loved one that you'd like to have featured on the show there's a key submission form at the vanished podcast.
