I know you have some pet peeves everyone does mine include the guy in front of me on the airplane who reclines it Steve right onto my laptop the phrase everything happens for a reason and glitter whether it arrives on clothes or holiday cards or presents it always ends up all over me you sure that in all of human history no one has ever benefited from glitter if a giant meteor destroy the Earth when the Cockroaches died the glitter would still be floating around in my work life my biggest pet peeve is management fats for the glitter of the Working World sparkly and ubiquitous but often useless and annoying sometimes their way out of date like the Myers-Briggs Personality tool other times they're fresh but sorely lacking an Evidence like using brain games for hiring but I don't just bug me cuz they're unhelpful they can be actively harmful take the idea that you have a learning style you're about to trash that aren't you going to trash it I'm Adam Grant and this is work-life my podcast with Ted sponsored by Accenture bonobos Hilton at JPMorgan Chase psychologist I study how to make war not suck and management feds or a big reason why work often sucks so I'm taking them on in this bonus episode to do that I got together with Stephen Dubner you might know Stephen from the popular Freakonomics podcast in book series discuss with him actually debate with him the merits of certain fats and work-life do we sat down in Boston this spring during the MIT Sports analytics conference to Hash it out who's Stephen Dubner why are you here why am I here in life why do you do what you do oh oh oh Hai by the way hello everybody why do I do what I do so I'm a writer by training and by temperament and sentiment so in my experience most people who become writers like me are people who are incapable of really doing anything useful I can't make anything I can't build anything I can't solve any problems and so I just follow around people who do those things so I would submit busting but maybe I'll say a little bit of fat busting so one of these that drives me crazy is open plan offices basic idea is pretty simple right we want people to have more creative collisions we want people interact more and then Ethan Bernstein just ran this experiment where a company went from cubicles to open plant and people had 70% fewer face-to-face interactions afterward and they sent more emails and I I think this was just throw it cannot handle all the overstimulation I need to focus so let me just get into his own here and get out of my face why do you think this bad persist I guess it's cheaper to have open plan offices problem in any kind of you know Public Health public policy accelerator so I can sing I don't think it's that complicated so I know the Ethan Bernstein studying Ethan and someone who else was retarded okay and and it was a really interesting finding to see the people wanted less face-to-face interaction I mean to me their number of substrata that are interesting to think about including will wait a minute me personally I hate face-to-face interaction not that I hate people although visually but collectively in practice I like people in theory I don't care about creating an office environment that works the best for the most people most of the time it's not that hard and I think a lot of modern office design is doing it now which is basically some kind of hybrid model that I work mostly on my own about 94% of the time then to 6% of I go in with my awesome crew and I kind of love it I mean if you're working solo you have more great ideas for good ideas and you get the opposite of your brainstorming in a group but you can get the best of both worlds with intermittent collaboration in a team I think the mechanism that was really interesting that if you're in a team that's brainstorming together all the time the less creative people they just copy the ideas of the most creative people whereas if you let them work separately they actually come up with ideas of their own and are able to enhance the creativity of the most creative people that's really interesting so would the mechanism by which they fail or by which they copy be that they are sort of in but they're they're risk-averse I don't know if you've written about this or where I've read it but I do know that like meeting culture generally which you know like it it's really easy to slam it because it it's been mostly bad for a long time although I do think the people are getting better at it but when really basic piece of advice that I read that I thought was brilliant so so simple in retrospect is what are the odds that the quiet shy non bravado possessing person has a worse idea than the noisy cocky good presenting while presenting person and I would say probably the correlation is negative and other words if you're the kind of person who's quiet and thoughtful and maybe shy you probably spend a lot more time actually thinking. Just thinking as opposed to the noisy people and I don't want to just threw every extrovert sorry the thing that made me eat the strategy that I thought was so simple and so brilliant is when you have the quiet person at a meeting or making a shy person to the young person with a less-experienced person it's very simple to say you know if after 15 minutes you haven't heard from that person just invite them hey harry I haven't heard from you what do you think about a million ways to do with it doesn't feel like singling out what he wanted and if they don't want to contribute then find they don't but to be invited to do that I think is that we once wrote a story about a hospital that was trying to increase hand hygiene rates and the person who ultimately came up with the solution after many many many failures was the the epidemiologist at the hospital who is just by Nature kind of studious quiet person but it took until all the noisy ideas that failed months and months before she even had the kind of I guess maybe courage and I think that's an easily it's an easy remedy to a problem that is pretty large it is I also I've been kind of play with a few other solution to this problem at one of them is to take the associa metric badges that were invented at the MIT media lab where you have everyone in the room where them and I didn't just play some real time how much time it's person is commanding and you pretty quickly see like wow I'm the idiot who is dominating the conversation I also have groups brainstorm I don't let people resent their own ideas I at least want to decouple okay who generated the idea and then you know who selling it at my hope is that if there's a really good presenter ever a good idea will randomly land in their hands and make it to take it to Pigeon it's a really neat idea we know there's there's zero if not negative correlation between the quality of your ideas in the quality of your pitching I think there's a there's a puzzle though for most of us to try to do creative work which is pretty bad at judging our own ideas I have a former student Justin Berg who who just finished a really interesting research research shows that if you were to take all your ideas will say you got 20 ideas for your next book and you bring them from favorite to least favorite your favorite idea is not your most promising I apparently you're you're too in love with it to see the flaws it's your second favorite idea where you have a little bit more distance from it you can see it more objectively you recognize what's wrong with it but you also have enough passion for it to one fix it and so I'm getting afraid that people are going to start gaming the system and say wait so if I just take my favorite ID in ranked at second then I'm good how do you think about getting better at that calibration tasks and knowing when the idea you love is actually not that good yeah that's it it's a really good question in hard so I have a weekly show get there a lot of things good and bad about that bad is that you need a good idea every week and therefore you're more likely to put up with an idea that really isn't that good what's good is it is a deadline and it is an incentive to constantly work really hard to come up with good ideas and so I'd say that for every idea that we end up doing there were probably 10 to 20 that got into some stage of thinking about and where were abandoned as being bad but because of my structure in that there is a kind of mechanism for acceptance or rejection but there's a middle ground then there's an idea like leaven idea will start producing it will start interviewing people and it's just like boring so for me I have a very selfish set of criteria it needs to be interesting to me it needs to be potentially fun for me and my phone on me like laughing fun I mean like it has to be interviews that I look forward to doing it as be writing I look what you doing sir yes sir I have what are for me internally a set of what seemed to be fairly High bars I'm sure they're not high at all but you know what I don't do too much is try to use listener data to determine topics because I think that listeners might like that or might think they like it I know I wouldn't after I mean some would some other suggestions I my love but they would want to hear like 20 podcasts on universal basic income in a row but they tweet a lot so that's what's real and what's fake magnitude and so on I would argue that there can be a really really really big benefit in not listening to or caring too much about what other people think about what you're doing. because if you start to think o will this be successful will be popular will people think I'm a blank for asking that kind of question will they think I'm rude will they think I'm insincere whatever then it starts to get more and more and more middling and then and we kind of do live in a world of a lot of middling stuff now that's a couple other fads cuz one of the things that drives me crazy as an organizational psychologist is walking into a company and find out that they still use something would like the Meijer brakes it's kind of like driving a horse in the era of cars and like a horse is really great Circa 1890 right there is the fastest vehicle on the market episode has a lot of problems quick Public Service Announcement it's not about horse manure we're not going deep in the Myers-Briggs here if you want more on that I did a whole episode on personality and season 1 before that I wrote an open letter breaking up with the tool and then another post called mbci if you want me back you need to change to in short despite its popularity the personalities will hit the meter reliability and validity issues and it's lagging way behind contemporary science so why don't fans like that. I partially because of good marketing and the fact that people have invested time money and emotions in them but it's also because middle managers are often reluctant to rock the boat I talked with Stephen about how to change that there's about half a century of of evidence and you know probably just called in for me coming out of Sociology showing that if you are at the top you have very little to lose by taking a risk trying something boldly creative and if you're at the bottom and you take a risk how many more to follow for Middle managers who spent 5 10 20 years working their way to that position and they have a lot to lose by taking a risk and they're all so of course often selected to move up that way by their ability to come before I'm an enforcer routines and norms and rules do you have any thoughts on how to open the minds of middle managers I mean no that's not helpful but I mean raising gentlemen Stephen Dubner but the knee-jerk response would be you no incentives cuz that's what you know economically believes in incentives the problem is when you talk to people in firms about incentives they usually hear Financial incentives whereas in fact as you well know and is used in your work all over the place they're all different kinds of incentives there are social incentives in Marlin sentence and reputational incentives and so on and I do think that within firms if we friends again I've been around a lot of firms I used to have a job a long time ago I did not like having jobs which is why I don't have one anymore I'm also not good at having jobs because I like to say I like to say what I really thought at meetings which I realize that's not what meetings are for I think what works really well calling cameras work I'm guessing you know well cam camera is an economist by training was also super mathematical in the graduated college at the age of like 8 or something and I was talking to him years ago about Fame and how it's one of these is very strange come out of these it from afar whether a foreign distance or foreign time might seem to have great value but that up close is actually cost and he said yeah that's why what you really want is local Fame local Fame I've observed not scientifically but I was racially over the years local Fame is incredibly powerful and desirable it's why I like you know when you go home to your family and you've done something that they approve of like that feels incredibly good and within a firm even if it's within your little pot of five people or eight people forget about the whole company so I think recognizing that kind of incentive recognizing that kind of emotion and try to turn that into an incentive is the way to basically help people feel good about taking risk that might result of that I also found myself thinking a lot about prospect theory here and saying okay look you know we know from Decades of a kind of minutes first game that when people have a certain game they like to play it safe and protected and when people are facing a guaranteed loss that's when they're willing to take a chance right so I find it a lot of middle managers are pretty happy with the status quo and so trying to sell them on the benefits of a new practice or of walking away from an old bad but like I kind of like things the way they are whereas if you can highlight the cost of I'm sticking with the status quo and say look here is this at this year to buy this is a horrible idea then they either get really excited about changing or they get extremely defensive it is remarkable to me that as customized as our culture has gotten in matching different things right so consumer preferences you can act on them really specifically like to have a digitally digitally search Universe of things that you need to acquire is a massively efficient upgrade over the way it used to be I used to need a Sears catalog or whatever it now like whatever I want I can literally type it and find it and so I feel like our mechanisms right now for matching people at a person and all their intellectual and emotional etcetera etcetera etcetera components to a work wife that will be good for them and that they will be good at I feel like we're really bad at the horrible so what are you doing about that nothing of you or your people yeah although I don't need the matching question is nearly as interesting as the changing question whatever job you landed how do we both know the job to you and help you move yourself to be effective in that job that would be to me a little bit like if we're going to use a sport analogy be like you know I'm going to play it Sports when I'm young and I want to be a professional athlete how do I decide and at what point do I do like to devote all my resources to the one I mean I believe hugely in I don't like the word passion because it's come it's become just like a greeting card word but I do believe I do believe strongly in the idea of passion the end that it's really hard to get good at anything unless you love doing that thing next fad 10,000 hours so misunderstood for 10,000 hour rule is just been like like a piece of Taffy or something has been pulled and stretched than Frozen and then melted like it's come to mean a very very very basic thing to most people which it was never meant to mean okay so I'm sure you've heard that David Hamrick at all meta-analysis looking at how much does deliberate practice really matter and showing that it's highly influential for four games for definitely for music as well it explains less than 1% of the variance in professional performance data so like I know you know the working on your end Anders Ericsson and his cohort who did really really great research in many many domains and basically all they really argued was it if you want to be really really good at something you have to work really hard at it right who knew if they don't work hard they're probably not going to end up being really good so I just a little bit, but I mean genes are killer people and not just in physical stuff also so really I mean you read books like yours or read a book like Angie Duckworth book grit will you find is that people who get really really really amazingly good at something they kind of did it all often or at least you know if there if we want to make like five dimensions on which were going to measure accomplishment they were like at least a seven out of 10 on all 5 so yeah I'm being you know ferlito incident in really lazy is almost never going to work but being really really hard working at let's say basketball if you're not you know somewhat talented is also not going to work so I'm trying to learn to be a good golfer that brings us to another Fat learning styles you're about to trash that aren't you going to trash it since we're supposed to be his first find out in Maya kinesthetic auditory or visual learner but I'm supposed to digest that information you know through the the learning style that's comfortable for me and her passion in his colleagues did a massive review of all the evidence for decades and they found no compelling evidence whatsoever that your so-called learning style has any applications for your actual learning and learning some of that might be because every think about it there are probably times when you learn something better when it's harder for you right the more you have to struggle to comprehend something that the more you actually internalize as opposed to say hi this is a breeze I don't really have to think about it much the other thing that I think it's fascinating about learning styles there has been some of it is just some tasks that are better learned in one medium to another it was that the audience to try something for a second. Can I ask all of you to think of a language that you speak fluently Steven do speak any languages other than English at those if you could do think of a language that you speak other than English if you do and let's let's make French for those of you who are looking for a language I want you to picture a perfect French accent okay that didn't work that it tried drawing it doesn't work in the visual medium does it okay wait now try to do it kinesthetically can you stand up and act out a perfect French accent after cured and I think so many tests work that way that you didn't give that somebody was about to stand your fake friends write a lot of some things we just have to learn by doing them and others that we have to learn by hearing them or reading them and so I would just love to know how do we get this particular myth to go away so I trust you and believe you but I'm not sure I fully embrace the concept there is an outfit that's now called I think new classrooms I don't know if you've ever heard of them but I'm it operated from a very basic idea which is basically the idea that you're trashing which is that there are different quote learning styles but basically there were some Educators who looked at kids trying to learn math needs were mostly kind of kids who didn't come low income low education kids and they were getting really really stuck on math in like 4th to 6th grade whatever and the guy who originated it looked at what was actually happening in a classroom you've got Thirty let's say kids and one instructor and one mode of instruction which is to illustrate and describe it and then let the participants kind of practice and master it and they all have to go at roughly the same Pace what are the odds that that's going to work out really well as you can it's very easy to imagine how it wouldn't so what he did is he totally free Sheridan said we're going to take smaller groups with him up and we're going to offer a bunch of different modalities of learning some kids will do group learning peer-led teacher-led virtual learning game playing Bubba blah and then every day every kid gets tested in that area to see how they did using which modality of learning and then the next day overnight the algorithm writes your playlist for the next day to see what modality should you use to learn the next lesson and hint that program showed really impressive gains because it seems to say to me and then you made you may know more than I or you may just disagree with that it would seem to say that in that case for 11 year old kids learning math indeed there are some people made it's not a learning sound personal Comfort think maybe they didn't like being surrounded by kids that they felt we're smarter maybe they didn't like they hated the teacher so it may be really hard to dispute angle that maybe I hate attention to them they let them be a little more engaged or exercise some some individual discretion their preference and then it's not as bad as I thought I agree again I totally believe you know a lot more about this tonight so I totally believe that what you're saying is true but I would be a little bit hesitant to throw out the baby with the bathwater I like living in a world where people not only have different capabilities but different ways to exercise has capabilities so again I'm nothing but I'm going to stick with my story I like to hear a stick of differing to the expert almost different but it's very high emotional intelligence and something to hear it it's interesting to me that that What I Hear What I Hear You talk about that if you think about this Freedom that's a good thing but I worry about with learning styles is that they actually restrain people right so I have people come into my classroom all the time he will say things like well I'm just not an auditory learner so you know I can't listen to a lecture and the other reality is will be Electra needs to be better or we should find some ways for you to pay attention differently right there's no reason why somebody should get away with saying this is not the way that I like to learn and therefore I can get away with like you're worried that they're limiting their own learning and they're closing the door two different ways of engaging because they say I prefer to engage that doesn't mean I can only learn that your view is that they just they have some aversion to and if they worked at it they would Master it or just that you don't have to lie I definitely disagree with you on this podcast but I do not like podcasts I'll say it right here I do not enjoy listening to podcast they're too slow like that's why we listen on 2X and I had to excuse that makes it chipmunk that's no better what I mean by what I mean by it is they the amount of for me useful and or entertaining and or chuckle producing information that they deliver per second is really low for me I'm just saying if you so I know and I realize some of them are awesome I love reading the transcripts of those same podcast that I wouldn't want to listen to why because I can read a lot faster than I can skim and scan so are you telling me that I'm I should just like get with the program and learn to listen slowly and be bored no definitely not your learning actually might not be better in that reading is giving that you're doing you might enjoy it more if you're not that's really getting more out of it I'd also say that what I've learned to love about listen to podcasts I can listen when I'm at the dentist or when I take out the garbage I just love being able to learn and listen without having a stroke I make it a point to not go to the dentist I don't take out my own garbage so I so I really feel like I'm solving your problems for you here by a different kind of wish one more thing before we wrap since since you're trying to master golf I have a very strong feeling that golf is not a sport it's a game I'm at my rule is that if you can be drunk and still play it well it's not a sports and so golf belongs in the category with billiards and darts and poker agree or disagree lot of people like to have the sport vs. Gameboy argument it's been going on in my circles for many years and it includes NASCAR and formula one that really I don't really care I will tell you something of more probably important than my opinion is that Mike Arthur and Freakonomics stuff Steve Levitt wrote a really nice paper about poker that ended up being significant in a legal argument about whether it was a game of cancer game skill that's a different argument than whether it's a game or a sport but poker I think anybody knows even a little bit of Poker a stupid as to acknowledge that there is fair amount of skill involved so if you want to call Gulf a game as opposed to sport I'm totally fine with that the one thing I will Channel yuan is nobody plays it as well drinking and I know that cuz almost everybody I play with except me does drink when doing it and that's why I play with them it's cuz they're all better than me but because I know they're going to be drinking I know that by the time we get to the end I will be better than them so that's um I feel bad that you spilled my strategy but that's the only way I can beat people to have them drink then my work here is done thank you for sharing this is fun what type is hosted by me Adam Grant shows produced by Ted with transmitter media art includes calling Helms Greta code Grace Rubenstein Michelle Quint Angela Chang and Janet Lee Curtis episode was produced by Jessica Glaser and Dan O'Donnell on original music by Hans Dale suit and Alison Laten Brown thanks to MIT for hosting our discussion and is Stephen Dubner for joint and texted you for listening if you like what you heard please rate and review the show and help people find us what is your take on emotional intelligence I would argue that mine is relatively low I don't know what to make of that because if if you said yours was high I would say that's a sign that it's low. One more thing you know I love data and we'd love your help in gathering some data about work-life let us know what you think at survey.com work-life will appreciate your feedback on strengths to build a gun and weaknesses to overcome that survey nerds.
