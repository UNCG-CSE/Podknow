Los Amigos Mexican Restaurant & Bar is a sliver of a play stuck between the monolithic gambling Halls of Caesars and Bally's in Atlantic City and its tacos are a Talisman of sorts I think so few people like I had a couple gamblers that you said to eat here before they went that's patch melee she's owned Los Amigos for 40 years and in that time she said more than a few superstitious high rollers swing through her spot for some baja fish tacos or Carnitas before hitting the tables there post would bring them in and said I was just someone employed by a casino to take care of the big gamblers who are also called whale and this one well couldn't get enough of Lowe's Amigos so that fella told me he win when I come here so happens like that you know it's awesome really yeah he felt lucky so that was a big plus please his gambling spot of choice was Trump Taj Mahalthe now-defunct casino previously owned by the 45th president of the United States Donald J Trump give high rollers are whales than the Taj Mahal was the most opulent over-the-top whale sanctuary in the world when it opened in 1990 it was the largest most expensive Casino ever built with its minarets and domes and life-size elephant statues the charge cost nearly a billion dollars and most of the gaming floor the size of three football fields is New Year's Eve the 8th Wonder of the world the Trump Taj Mahal casino resort in Atlantic Citynew casino the 8th Wonder of the world wonder where the Pyramid of Giza thought about that pop Superstar Michael Jackson and supermodel Elle Macpherson wear on hand for the grand opening so was Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous is Robin Leach because you know why not the white supermodel Elle Macpherson from the Taj Mahal he's my friend he's a tremendous talent and that it's really my honor it's too big day for metrump card in an absolutely an ironic way in addition to its other superlatives the charge was the most lucrative Casino in the world hauling in hundreds of thousands of dollars a day at least for a while but then just a year after it opened Atlantic City's most glittery diamond and the Crown Jewel in Trump's Casino Empire went bankrupt a year after that comes to other New Jersey casinos also filed for bankruptcy by the time the final dice were thrown at the Taj in 2016 Trump's Casino operation had gone bankrupt six times the holding company that owned Trump's casinos was the only public company Trump ever ran and every year that Trump was in charge lost money in spite of that its CEO Donald J Trump pulldown seven-figure bonuses year after yearthe story of trump entertainment Resorts is a story with many things it's about the basic supply-and-demand the relationship between a slit developer and a desperate City and the consequences of gambling with other people's money and livelihoods and losing I've learned over and from American public media in the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota this is spectacular failures the show that goes all-in failure even though Lady Luck isn't always on our side if you've ever been to an American beech you have probably felt a presence of Atlantic City in the form of salt water taffy that sticky Coastal convection that can be found in every tchotchke shops selling seashell jewelry and t-shirts that read life is better in flip-flops salt water taffy was invented in Atlantic City in the late 1880s Legend has it that a storm dumped ocean water on an early batch of the candidate hence its name but more likely the treats and Bender was just really good at marketing and that's also the story of the queen of resorts for sale Atlantic City and it's early days Atlantic City was billed as a health resort the idea was that the are there would sure people of illnesses and I and I love that the one of the references they promised if you come to Atlantic City that time you'll get lots of ozone that's Bryant Simon he's a history professor at Temple University and the author of the book boardwalk of Dreams Atlantic City and the fate of urban America and I can tell you from a recent trip to Jersey's most famous sure I took in tons of ozone and now I'm cured of The Vapors by the early nineteen-hundreds Atlantic City and shed its health resort by Band start attracting a new white middle-class who suddenly had Leisure Time thanks to a changing American economy as a destination Atlantic City offered affordable luxury for the masses and was a place to dress up the March and say look I have enough money to take a week off and dress up and do nothing and and that quickly became the more important thing the thing that would make it lantic City America's first great middle-class Resort Disneyland before there was Disneyland or was the boardwalk with a capital B like the most expensive Monopoly property the original Four Mile Long wooden walkway as wide is a two-lane Highway and some places was finished in 1916 and it was one of the most important Promenade the day a place to see and be seen go on the boardwalk save their best clothes for when they walk down the boardwalk and and they weren't demure closing they were meant to be ostentatious in over-the-top pants that were Kris so sharply they could cut you in the middle of the summer women wearing cashmere sweaters with mink stole is not worrying about sweating they wanted you to notice the mink stole and at the heart of that Ray was this ride down the boardwalk in a rolling chair the rolling chair find the most unique attractions early Atlantic City and one of the most troubling so think of a two-person chair made out of wicker and then give it wheels and a handle the back so I can be pushed it's like a rickshaw but there's no real Transportation purpose the people getting pushed along had no particular place to go and the job of rolling chair Pusher that was generally reserved for black men for white immigrants who sometimes we're not included in the American story for Jews particularly for Italians for the Irish to be fully made into Americans and how do you become fully made into Americans you become white and part of being way it is controlling black labor mean that is a story of America elegant hotels and restaurants staffed by black workers allowed weight vacationers to live out their race and class role-playing fantasies and this friction would permit the city for decades to come Simon jokes that Atlantic City's hay day was when everything along the boardwalk with shiny and new like almost a hundred years ago but at least world population standpoint he's right the city chopped out at 66,000 year-round residents in 1930 around that time prohibition brought all kinds of Nair do well to town doing things that Nair do well do Boos and booze Halls flopping and flop houses your garden-variety Hustlin by World War II the city and tidied itself up and pitch in to the war effort housing convalescing soldiers in the city's Grand Jazz Age hotels and it's still captured a place in the country's imagination City life will be peaches and cream that is the voice of mr. dick haymes but everything wasn't peaches and cream for Atlantic City city ground to a halt this is a place that lives on fumes for a long time business hold out in the 1950s it's past its Heyday there's not a lot of investment there's not much new housing being built so it's really one of these places like a lot of small American city is where the hate is 1929 plus as the country's black population became more upwardly-mobile and began vacationing at the shore a lot of white people were treated to The Burbs and the Backyard Pools there in you know your standard grounds white flight story I would argue that race and racism kill Atlantic City that middle-class whites no longer wanted to vacation in places that were diverse in and so that they went to see places that could create that exclusion and that's Disneyland in 1964 the city tried to pretty itself up for the Democratic National Convention for reporters still wrote about how trashy this city had become the hotels were in disrepair the stores were boarded up and hucksters tried to shake people down for money at every turn by the early 1970s the city was desolate Ryan Simon Says residents used to joke that you could roll a bowling ball down the center of the boardwalk and it wouldn't hit anyone which probably wasn't a hilarious joke of you ran one of the boardwalks Penny arcade's or hot dog stands or 9000 salt water taffy shops local leaders knew they had to make a drastic change Ralph's Atlantic City was going to become a ghost town so they propose a little plan to change their luck they would become Vegas by the Sea Atlantic City used to be the resort area in the country is deteriorated at the house on casino gambling in Atlantic City and the move broader of I sense of hope to the place reputation yes there will be problems like making sure I can Eyes Crying is kept out but as a former judge and prosecutor that's something I know how to do and as Governor that's what I intend to do in 1976 New Jersey voters passed a referendum allowing casino gambling in Atlantic City before this Nevada was the only u.s. state with a legal gambling operation the decision monumental drive around this town enough and you can feel a change is coming it's not part of the regular seeing likes a salt water taffy butt in among those familiar landmarks and down the length of Atlantic Avenue you sense the excitement and challenge of change on the way of course he's change but a bold new decision sets the city in motion for Atlantic City the decision of the century was casino gambling casinos legalized that was much more interesting place to be in to work again he was the gaming writer for the Press of Atlantic City for 20 years he also worked at the New Jersey casino Control Commission so he knows a little something about the business of chance we are walking along the longest boardwalk in the world on an absolutely scorching hot day like I was sweating through my trousers so cute who remembers that after the referendum the city was Deluge with Casino bids from all kinds of operator at one point we counted somewhere around forty six different proposals for casinos oh my gosh in order to make way for the Glitz & Glam new casinos most of the old legendary Atlantic city hotels including the treymore in the Marlborough Blenheim or demolished because when the chips are down you better put on your Poker Face double down and go For Broke the first casino to open in Atlantic City was Resort which is like a who's on first situation Resorts is actually the worst name for a resort am I the only one who thinks this anyway the hype around Resort opening was huge was swamped it was absolutely mop the biggest problem they had they didn't have to do any marketing couldn't count the money the one fast enough right but they would run out of coin years how hennigan's old paper the Press of Atlantic City describe Resorts opening at the time quote the wheels are spinning in the dice are rolling in the coins are blinking and the grand old damn Atlantic City has a saucy swivel in her head she never had before the city will never be the same again and the writer was correct the city was never the same but perhaps not in the way the writer expect it Resorts was part of the first wave of casinos to open in Atlantic City it was followed closely by Caesars Bally's in Harrah's all Vegas Mainstays 9 casinos open in the span of 3 years and they were great for the city they brought year-round employment and tax revenue what's the building boom made the city feel alive again but then the number of casinos Nevada Casino space had grown faster than the demand for it did so basically there were too many casinos and non-gamblers that it was in that environment that was Trump first came to town we're going to take a quick break so I can go hit the slots big money big money big money when we come back how Donald Trump's Casino Empire took shape with the help of junk bond 1800 lawsuits and an elite 3.5 million dollar loan from Daddy Trump and

everyone will be smoking out while I was drinking martinis shaken not stirred not so casinos at least in America are for the masses and recently added lantic city is Golden Nugget Casino my producer Whitney and I were those masses prepared to lose $25 is the best ranked Casino out of 9 according to the news website nj.com the casino features about 1,500 slot machines which for person with sensitive ears like me is about 1499 slot machines too many in this eMachines it was hard to know which one to pick which game should I play Beer House Spartacus Napoleon and Josephine pirate ship or Double Diamond deluxe Triple Diamond game called triple double diamond and feta $5 bill into the machine sadly we didn't quite know how to play today's one-armed Bandits are just a bunch of flashing buttons and Loud dings the recently video games with no fun levers to pull so this it we're playing we're playing the slots right now yeah do you want to play the remaining ones you're doing great in fact I wasn't you got to get that cut to three minutes later for definite can I get is $5 richer you're welcome Casino we picked the Golden Nugget not because of what it is now but because of what he used to be see you before the Golden Nugget was the eighth best casino in Atlantic City it began if life is part of Donald Trump's gaming Empire in the late 70s, was just beginning to grow his real estate development business one of his early projects was the Commodore Hotel in Midtown Manhattan in the middle of the Commodore deal Trump got wind of just how much money a mid-tier casino could bring in this is from his book The Art of the deal now for the first time it occurred to me that even if I finally got the hotel built and it became a major success in the greatest city in the world it's still wouldn't be nearly as profitable as a moderately successful Casino Hotel in a small desert town in the southwest I tried to get pepper do surgery done is best Trump voice but he refused sad in order to understand the growth of Trumps gaming Empire you first have to understand a little about the man at this time and that will turn to Pulitzer prize-winning investigative reporter David Cay Johnston he discovered from since the late 1980s he was the story of Atlantic City casinos and he's a flamboyant character unlike the Casino Executives who are boring suits he was clearly out marketing himself is this empresario Johnson says fellow Casino owners and state Regulators Trump might be great at telling a brand he might not be so hot at running a gambling operation Donald is not an operator and I go what do you mean Donald is not an appointment what does that mean and it was code for other people run the business cuz he doesn't know anything about the casino business as with most things involving Trump the story gets real complicated real fast in 1982 Trump received a license to run a casino in Atlantic City the approval hearing took just minutes according to Trump he got his financing in place and had received all the appropriate permits when he got a call from the CEO of the company that owned Harrah's Casinos they wanted to partner with Trump on his new Venture and Trump was like oh hell yeah partnering with hair has meant at Harrah's would put up a financing for the price and Trump wouldn't have to risk anything and have that all taken care of on his first Casino outing that was huge sorry so just like that trump it out of the casino to his growing portfolio properties so the attraction was this was quick easy money and low risks compared to being a developer mom was never a big developer has the biggest developer New York he was nowhere near that he wasn't even in the top five or ten but this was an easy way to make a lot of money from Plaza opened in 1984 to Great Fanfare the casino and hotel to pop an entire city block and featured 60,000 square feet of gaming space it was sleek and flashy and gave the Common Man a glimpse into deep breath and class of Trump's New York World also it made a lot of cash Trump Plaza whose first Casino which is right at the center of the boardwalk what is a mighty cash engine was just spilling money into his pocket left and right shortly after Trump Plaza open on the boardwalk opportunity to open even bigger casino on the Seas Marina the Hilton Hotel chain had built a hugely expensive Waterfront Casino the casino Control Commission denied its application for a license it seems surprising that Barron Hilton owner of one of the largest hotel chains in the world couldn't get a casino license but Donald Trump could especially given the criteria which former gaming reporter Dan Hennigan explains our character honesty Integrity Financial stability your business ability and this applies to everyone involved holding company and parent company and the Employee Self Service directors all have to meet this standard after being denied a license Hilton was desperate to get his project back on track while simultaneously trying to fend off a takeover by Vegas casino Mogul Steve Wynn so when Donald Trump called with an offer to buy the salt Casino project Hilton reluctantly answered Trump borrow 350 million then $5000000 fee off the top to pay himself for the deal and she named the new operation Trump's Castle it opened in 1985 just a year after Trump Plaza's roulette wheel started spinning naturally Trump's Partners in his first Casino weren't thrilled about the new purchase which would directly compete with their investment hair is to Trump but eventually you just bought out the company shares again with borrowed money that lost who was just one of nearly 1,800 the Trump's casinos were involved in despite all those lawsuits David Cay Johnston says Trump was never personally on the hook for anything financially Donald never had a dollar invested in any of his casinos in the first one he got money upfront from his Partners II won the Hilton he borrowed 100% of the purchase price and took a 5 million dollar fee off the top for himself the third one same thing he took these in that so it never did Donald Trump have a dollar. No skin in the game in Atlantic City so his rate of return you can't calculate its infinite people wanted with Trump was selling and that was gold-plated Grandeur and every man sort of luxury and he promoted that using the ultimate equalizer boxing Trump Plaza was legendary for its fight night and there was none more legendary than the 1988 heavyweight title bout between Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks when did Sanaa Lathan Elementary special introduction first in the ring at this time that gentleman responsible for bringing this spectacular event to Atlantic City and I would like him to be properly acknowledged the man who could sell the business epitomizes the American dream the author of the year's best selling book The Art of the deal is vision and accomplishment make him the quintessential entrepreneur ladies and gentlemen New Jersey's tanks in our host for this great evening ringside seats when for $1,500 each and every celebrity who is anyone was there that night Oprah Madonna a handful of Madonna's ex-boyfriend Tyson won by a knockout just 91 seconds in but the match brought in more than 70 million dollars at the time it was the highest grossing fight in history Trump Plaza Casino earned Millions more than usual that night thanks to high rollers feeling particularly flush the Donald had become an Unstoppable force in Atlantic City fresh off his Tyson Spinks windfall Trump bought the old Playboy Atlantis Casino for $63 and renamed it Trump Regency so if you're keeping track that's three Atlantic City properties for Trump in 5 years then came the biggest deal of trump career the Taj Mahal Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City some Economist call it a reckless gamble but the customers we talked to seem to like it just fine Beyond pet relief remedy staff white then Matic and controversial owner Donald Trump Fox News Bill O'Reilly doing Inside Edition puff piece on Trump in 1990 simpler times the driver call was a beast of a resort at the time it was the tallest building in New Jersey with more than 1,200 hotel rooms well restaurants and strip club because why not but at the end of the day the charger was still just a casino from stirred in what was already an oversaturated Market when he got his third Casino the Taj Mahal he was competing against himself you know when General Motors had the Cadillac the Buick the Oldsmobile the Pontiac in the Chevrolet they differentiated them the only real difference was how they were financed like drums to other Atlantic City casinos the Taj wasn't Trump's original development he swooped in when the owner of the company developing a property. I even beat out entertainment Legend Merv Griffin for ownership of the casino that would become the Taj now this casino wasn't cheap but Trump had to have it and promised to be doubling yes most disneyfied Casino in the city so he found a way to finance it and how did Trump pay for this Leviathan of loot junk bonds now if you listen to previous episodes you'll be familiar with the concept if you're new to the show Welcome a junk bond is a risky Financial product that offers the promise of a big payout for the investor if the issuer of the bond is successful and it can get much-needed cash to the bond issuer quickly but it can also put them up their eyeballs in debt just as fast junk bonds are basically inject that on the books of your company the same way that heroin dealers get you inject drugs into your bloodstream and it makes you feel good for a while but unless you have produced really phenomenal profits the interest rate is so high you're not going to recover and Donald borrowed money in one case at 14 and a quarter percent interest for one of his Casino deals funny the trumpet all over town with his other properties plus fees junk bonds which by the way he told the casino Control Commission he wasn't going to use it was more than a billion dollars on the line and trumpet personally guaranteed 833 million dollars of that sometimes when you can't afford your dad so you have to ask people for help in Trump's case he called on his father Fred in 1990 shortly after the Taj open trunk was having trouble making interest payments on one of his loan soap opera Trump sent an emissary to Trump's Castle to buy 3.5 million dollars and chips that were never going to be at the casino Control Commission caught wind of this and the casino had to pay a $65,000 penalty for accepting an illegal loan still says dan Hennigan Trump's appeal remained miraculously intact image that he was a big rich powerful guy and folks want to be close to him and he certainly bed that image here and created a buzz in town any time he comes around if you have followed even a minute of coverage about Trump's presidency this will likely sound familiar to you but in Atlantic City the bus didn't last in 1991 things start to go south for Trump's Casino Empire first Trump Plaza had to pay a $200,000 penalty for discriminating against black and female dealers apparently the casino would remove those dealers from the floor when one particular High Roller played do you would actually flip out if he saw people dealing cards were white men then the Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy buckling under the weight of all those junk bonds Trump Plaza in Trump's Castle followed with bankruptcies has their own not long after ears from in 1992 explaining his No Good Very Bad Day Year too late night host David Letterman were you ever near broke divorce let's go back if you don't mind what did you have to unload a loaded the wife super classy what a guy not only did Trump lose his airline but he was also forced to give up his yacht and other holding though and he had been put on an allowance of $450,000 a month after all those bankruptcy proceedings Trump's Casino operation was desperate for cash so in 1995 he created a public company to house all of his gambling Enterprises the stock ticker symbol for his company was djt Donald J Trump Donald only had one publicly traded company and everybody lost money in that company vendors weren't paid worker sometimes weren't paid but Donald walked away with at least 83 million dollars but we're getting ahead of ourselves between 1995 and 2000 lots of reshuffling happened in Trump's Casino operation one property got demolished another got renamed and by 2001 the stock and Trump's public company was trading for about the price of a turn on a dollar slot machine not to be plie in 2004 Trump's public company Trump entertainment Resorts filed for chapter 11 so for those playing along at home or up to for bankruptcies related to comes Casino so far then the parent company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange by this point we're starting to look a little long in the tooth especially in the shadow of the sexy new Borgata Casino Dan Hennigan says because Trump's Casino company was leveraged to the hilt it was hard to find the resources for anything more than quick spit shine or patch job you come down as a player in its place starts to look a little shabby a property nearby that is reinvesting that closes one restaurant and opened up a brand new one you're going over there and you're seeing this. Dynamic Property you come to a place that's in financial trouble you see something a lot more static and it loses its excitement but deferred maintenance and competition from new properties weren't the only reasons Trump's Atlantic City operation was struggling neighboring states had slowly been legalized and casino gambling since 1993 by the mid-2000s gamblers had options up and down the Eastern Seaboard that would be purely looking for can I go and Gamble and if it's within my driving distance 20 minutes I'll go and do that that's rummy Pandit he is the executive director of the Lloyd D Levinson Institute of gaming hospitality and tourism at Stockton University he says this Market saturation is forced Casino owners to rethink their approach as time went by other markets in the area opened up Pennsylvania Delaware New York Maryland there for the shift had to be made which is what Atlantic City is looking at doing now is how can we follow model that's going to bring people in as a destination Resort in later wrestling to Atlantic City and Trump's Castle had its own live TV game show called Trump and the strip club and forget about that but there was a lot to differentiate the city or its casinos unlike in Las Vegas Celine Dion was doing residencies at the Tarzan Cirque du Soleil didn't stage a gasp inducing show at Trump Plaza in 2006 Atlantic City casino revenue peeked out at 5.2 billion dollars then the city and its gambling industry took a tumble and Trump's properties were falling faster than the rest in 2009 Trump entertainment Resorts filed for bankruptcy again that brings our tally to five this time Trump was pushed out as chairman of the board though he did retain a 10% stake in the company for use of his name his daughter Ivanka who was also on the board was scooted on out the door as well David Cay Johnston basically the people who control the Enterprise car like on his buddies they paid Donald to go away. I don't have no more Marquis value for them you know people weren't lying and saying we want to go meet Donald and they needed to cut down every expense they could and you know feeding Donald just was no longer a viable option by 2014 Trump entertainment Resorts now under the ownership of buyout can Carl Icahn had gone bankrupt in one more time that was number six and two out of the three Trump casinos have closed a year later the treasury Department find the Taj Mahal 10 million dollars for money laundering violations something Trump's casinos also got popped for back in the 90s the final die in the Trump casino Saga was cast by Worthy foe the casino Workers Union the union charge the Taj Mahal with failing to uphold its collective bargaining agreement that guaranteed employees health care and a pension in a proposal Trump entertainment Resorts suggested that because employees could get ObamaCare the casino didn't need to provide Health Care they could just give full-time workers the stipend to pay for Healthcare on The Exchange in the union was like nope Carl Icahn the Utah Jazz owner estimated that rehabbing the outdated Casino would have cost $100 but just be with the Union pushed him over the edge rather than up the ante icon folded the Trump Taj Mahal once Atlantic City's philashes casino was done guitar shudder just hours after then candidate Trump second presidential debate with Hillary Clinton 3,000 people lost their jobs naturally his opposition cast the failure as one of the many reasons why the Donald wasn't fit to be leader of the Free World Clinton took that message right to the city's iconic Boardwalk we're standing in front of the old Trump Plaza Casino and Hotel Donald Trump wants predicted it will be the biggest hit yet now it's abandoned you can just make out the word Trump where it used to be written in flashy lights he had the letters taken down a few years ago but his presence remains okay looking back you can totally see why she didn't win so it's fair to ask since he is applying for a job what in the world happened here girl the collapse of Trump's Atlantic City Empire came up over and over on the campaign trail Fox News host Chris Wallace asked him about it during one of the Republican primary debates question why should we trust you to run the nation's business because I have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country the chapter laws to do a great job for my company from myself for my employees from my family at cetera I have never have gone bankrupt by the way I have never but out of all the bills that I've done hundreds on four occasions I've taken advantage of the laws of this country like other people I'm not going to name the names cuz I'm not going to embarrass but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business section save used what the difference is when somebody else uses those laws nobody writes about it and then Tramadol like you got to know when to hold them all. I just told you I had the good sense and I've got no credit in the financial Pages very proud of it I want to tell you that very very proud of it now remember it was six bankruptcies 3 for the individual casinos and 3/4 the holding company another fact check Trump was pushed out of the public company that he started but not before he raped in a ton of cash though the casinos investors vendors and workers many of those folks to get a haircut David Cay Johnston says Trump left an indelible stain on the place would be a lot better off today if Donald Trump had never come to town Donald was there to just extract as much cash as he could as quickly as he could with no regard for what that means to the community to Trump's old casinos have new life Trump's Castle / Trump Marina is now the Golden Nugget and in late 2016 the Seminole tribe which owns the Hard Rock Brand bought the Taj Mahal for pennies on the dollar and turned it into the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino there is one Vestige of trump left in Atlantic City and that's the property that started it all the old Trump Plaza sits derelict in the middle of the boardwalk the Sea Air has not been kind to the building and it's been crumbling for years friend's name is Ben fried off the casino but you can still see the outline of letters it was scheduled to be demolished in 2018 but the deadline passed and much like its namesake it's still standing in games of chance the house has a built-in Advantage most players will eventually lose and the more times a player plays the more he loses there is apparently one exception to this rule President Donald J Trump read em and weep spectacular failures is a production of American public media in the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota its host an improved by me you do loser Lauren over winner Whitney Jones the show's producer editor is high roller Phyllis Fletcher RV music is by the delightful David Shulman other original music from the show comes from the Jeremy's Jeremy Castillo and Jeremy Ray Lauren he is the interim director of high-capacity p.m. are other Stellar APM buds include Alyssa Dudley Tracy Mumford and Christina Lopez big love to the marketplace DC Bureau especially pets East rise in the engineering staff John evens Evans Veronica Rodriguez and Corey schreppel are the heroes we need but don't deserve do for lots of things go to the following people on a Rosen just leaving Dan Zak Mali Harries Lulu Miller family dinner radio girl gang including Pam linga Big Bear Cafe that's rough and the numeral Uno Michael d'antonio book The Truth About Trump with super helpful for this episode as was making of Donald Trump by our pal David Cay Johnston and things too much to you are extremely successful listeners for checking the show out this is the last episode of the season but hit us up online we are in all the places and finally much gratitude to patch melee at Los Amigos for saving us from the casino buffets with her delicious vegan tacos Dolly Parton Dolly Parton was here.
