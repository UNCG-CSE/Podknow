these are the finest people in all of Houston Texas right here at Lakewood we love to have you be apartment thanks for tuning in today I like to start with something funny and I heard about these three men that were out in the wilderness They Came Upon This vile raging River they needed to get to the other side the first man prayed God please give me the strength to make it across and poof God didn't big arms and strong legs he was able to swim across in 2 hours the next man play God please give me the strength and the tools to make it across and poof God gave him a boat he was able to row across in 30 minutes the third man played God please give me the strength the tools and the intelligence to make it across and proof God turned him into a woman she looked at the map high five minutes up the stream and walked across the bridge and yes that was sent to me by a woman but here we go this is my Bible I am what it says I am I have what it says I have I can do what it says I can do today I will be taught the word of God I boldly confess my mind is alert my heart is receptive I will never be the same in Jesus name God bless you I want to talk to you today about don't settle for less all of us have dreams that were believed in foreign promises that God has spoken to us at one time we were excited about them but too often when it's taking longer than we thought because our health hasn't improved we didn't get the promotion our child isn't making good decisions we get discouraged and quit believing for the fullness of what's in our heart it's easy to water down what God's promised us I don't like this job but at least I'm employed is good enough I was believing for a nice house but I guess this apartment will do I was hoping to get well but I've learned to live with this sickness I guess I'm at least Okay no Okay is not who you were created to be good enough is not what God promised you the enemy can't stop God's plan for your life but he'll do his best to convince you to settle along the way if you're going to become all you were created to be you have to keep a fire in your spirit there has to be a holy determination are resolved that says I refuse to settle for less than what God's promise me you have to make up your mind you're not going to be talked out of it you're not going to water it down you're not going to let good enough be good enough it may be taking longer than you thought it may be more difficult the good news is it's not too late you haven't missed your chance what God promised you is still on the way not a watered-down version not a partial healing not a make do promotion not a good enough marriage know exactly what God promised you what you were excited about before the delays before the bad brakes is still in round God doesn't abort a dream he doesn't get talked out of what he's promised he doesn't water down what he spoken to us I may be the reason you're not seeing this favor is you settled you've accepted that your dreams not going to happen you never get well you'll never get out of debt as long as you think that way it will limit your life I'm asking you to pull up your steaks pack up your belongings mediocrity is not your home good enough is not your destiny getting by is not where you belong you may be there now but that is not your permanent location don't settle for an okay marriage okay job okay he'll okay Li yes we should be content but you shouldn't be satisfied with less than what you know God put in your heart I sometimes instead of stirring our faith up and believe in for the best we move the goalposts back to justify what we're saying I can't seem to break this addiction but if I can learn to manage it that's good enough I'll never reach my dreams but hey I'm doing as good as my co-worker that's not too bad I want instead of justifying it moving that goal post to FIT what you think is going to happen why don't you leave the gold there and say God I don't see how this can work out I don't see how I can get well how my family will be restored how can reach my dreams but God I know you wouldn't have promised it if you want to go to bring it to past I know you have a way where I don't see a way so I'm not going to settle here I'm going to keep believing I'm going to keep dreaming I'm going to keep stretching my thing that's what allows God to do great things Genesis 15 God told Abraham he was going to have a son the problem was Abraham was 75 years old his wife Sarah was 65 they never had children she's been bearing all these years now she is going through the change of life is impossible in the natural after you went by and no sign of a baby every thought told them you're wasting your time you're both way too old it's never going to happen Sarah finally told Abraham to sleep with her maid she thought that's the only way they could have a baby it seems so impossible she watered down the promise to reduced it to what she thought Could Happen many times we do like Sarah when God speaks something to us instead of coming up to his level believe in for the unusual The Uncommon the extraordinary we bring it down to our level look up word that the Compaq Center was coming available and the rockets were going to move out of this building something came alive on the inside I knew it was supposed to be ours but even though I was excited in my spirit my mind said there's no way we'll get the building it's too expensive the city will never let at church have it I was tempted to water it down voices whispered or come back to your senses don't get your hopes up it's never going to happen it's easy to get talked out of the great things God has in-store there will be times God speaks things to your spirit that don't make sense to you remind Sarah you can't have a baby at 80 get the basketball arena Dodie you'll never beat terminal cancer just accept it you never write your book never start your business never billed at Children's Home you're dreaming about you don't have the resources you may not but God does he's not asking you to figure it out he's asking you to believe why don't you take the limits off of him what you want I can't think of any good reason to get my hopes up seemed so unlikely so impossible let me give you one great reason the most high God is on your side he is breathing in your direction right now you wouldn't be hearing this if he wasn't about to do something unusual uncommon something that you didn't see coming you can't explain it it didn't make sense people will scratch their hands thinking how did you beat the sickness I saw the medical report how did your business take off so fast you didn't have the connections no but you have the favor of God you have his Blessing on your life what he's promised you will come to pass not a watered-down version not a get by version not a good enough version get ready for the fullness of what God Said make room in your thinking for the Abundant overflowing more than enough life that belongs to you the mistakes are made is she reduce what God promised to what she thought Could Happen Abraham I'm 80 years old Shirley God didn't mean I would have a baby let me find the maid and you can have a baby with her and we'll call that child our own oh you don't have to take up for God you don't have to try to make sure he doesn't look bad in case he doesn't come through let me help God make this happen God doesn't need that kind of help he flung Stars into space he spoke world into existence he's not at a loss at how to turn your situation around how to bring your child back on course and how to open a new door for your business don't reduce it to what makes sense to you don't let what you don't have to talk you out of what God does half get an agreement with him God this seems impossible to me but I know you can do the impossible I'm looking at it in the natural but I know you're a supernatural God you can take me where I can't go on my own when the three Hebrew teenagers were about to be thrown into a fiery furnace because they wouldn't bow down to the Kings golden idol the guards tied their hands and feet with chords they were thrown into the furnace bound they should have instantly been killed the fire was so hot when the guards threw them in the guards lost their lives put in a little while the king came to check on then he said didn't we throw three men in Bound I see four men loose and one looks like the Son of God there's my point you may feel like your hands are tied you've done your best you worked hard you prayed you believe but it seems like you've reached your limits it's never going to work out the good news is God's hands are not tied he's not limited but what's limiting us and I believe today some chords are being broken some change or coming off what's restricted you in the past has lost its grip that addiction that's held you back the sickness the financial difficulties the trouble at work this is a new day the Fourth Man In The Fire has shown up like these Hebrew teenagers you're going to come out not found but loosed free healed promoted Vindicated with that dream your believe in for now start seeing yourself friend see yourself breaking the addiction see yourself rising to new levels for filling your purpose your hands are not tired anymore God is releasing you in the new levels of your destiny Abraham slept with Sarah's maid and they had a son that they named Ishmael they loved Ishmael they were happy to have him but he was not the promise child no disrespect to him but Ishmael represents a spirit of good enough this is not what I was believing for but it's close it's good enough I'm not completely well but at least something better that's good enough I was hoping for that management position didn't work out this other job is good enough you don't have to sell God is not going to give you a substitute blessing he's not into counterfeit he's not into making do he has the real thing coming and you may have some good enough areas in your life but don't stop there don't let that Spirit of good enough cause you to be satisfied you have to keep stretching keep believing for the fullness of what God promised 25 years after God told Abraham he was going to have a son Ishmael was now 13 years old God came to him again and said in Genesis 13 Abraham Sarah is going to Bear you a child when Abraham heard this the scripture says he fell down laughing saying God I'm a hundred years old now Sarah is 90 how could you possibly have a baby at that age seems so impossible so unlikely he went on to say may Ishmael enjoy my inheritance he was saying God I'm okay with good enough I'm okay with the substitute blessing we love is Chanel what was he doing moving the goalposts God said Abraham I am not a God that gives good enough blessings you may be satisfied with a look alike with a mate do but not me I love you smell but I didn't say you made was going to have a son I said Sarah was going to have a son by this time next year she will give birth you were to name him Isaac even though Abraham settle for Ishmael even though they settled for having a baby a different way God said in a fact I don't settle I don't get talked out of what I promised you you may have watered it down but I am true to my word what God has spoken over you will come to pass not partially not in an indirect way not through your cousin not to wear you say this is good enough God is going to surprise you he's going to do it even though it seems too late even though you've made mistakes even though you've already accepted it Ishmael is good enough God is saying get ready Isaac is coming for some of you like God told them by this time next year you going to see something God promised that you've already written off something that you've already accepted it's too late now you settle but you don't know what God is up to he said have I spoken it and shall I not bring it to pass at 90 years old Against All Odds Sarah gave birth to a son they named him Isaac she looked at him and said who would have ever thought an old lady like me could have a baby God has some of these who would have ever thought blessings coming your way blessings you can explain favorite that doesn't make sense who would have ever thought we'd be having Church in the former Compaq Center who would have thought you would lead your company and sales who would have thought you can have a baby when you were told you couldn't have children who would have ever thought you could pay your house off this soon what am I saying don't settle for a watered-down version of what God promised you there are dreams he's whisper to you in the light things that seems so big so unlikely you don't tell anybody like Abraham you could laugh me be free from this addiction everyone in my family struggles with me have overflow in my finances have more than enough or maybe healthy strong in shape energetic that may seem so unlikely Easley discounted God wouldn't have promised it if he wasn't going to bring it to pass don't do like Abraham and Sarah talk about how impossible it is they settle for Ishmael what God was waiting to bring Isaac maybe that's why it took 25 years are you settling for ishmael's for good enough are you watering down what God promised talking yourself into it Isaac represents something that you never seen Isaac is more than you can imagine the greatness of God's favor what would happen if we would say God I've seen Ishmael God you've been good to me but I believe Isaac is coming Lord thank you for the fullness about Destiny thank you for opening doors no man can shop thank you for bringing promises to past it seem impossible thoughts will tell you all the reasons why it's not going to happen for you you're too old or Too Young you made too many mistakes you don't have the talent education the resources none of that stops Our God one touch of his favor and you'll see Isaac a friend of mine works in commercial real estate she had a large piece of property on the market for one of her clients for more than 20 years right on the main freeway the owner wasn't in a big hurry to sell it over the years she kept raising the price from several million to 12 million to over 20 million people told her it would never sell for that amount she was wasting her time a few months ago she brought a large check to the ministry it was the time the first 10% of the commission from selling the property she said I never went to school for this I didn't have the training but when this company called that wanted to buy add the property I met with their attorneys I was very nice but I said our price was firm they said fine will give you what you're asking she sold the property what's interesting is 15 years old leader she had given a $100 check to a young man in our ministry she's sold that as a seed and said God I want to be able to do more that dream was planted in her heart when she sold this property this new gift was a thousand times what she's given that young man God knows how to bring Isaac he said in Deuteronomy I will make you a thousand times more than you are wait here then think there's no way Jose nobody in my company makes that much your job is not your Source God is your source you may have seen Ishmael you seen God's goodness but there are some far-out things God has in your future goals and dreams that you can accomplish in the natural is going to take the supernatural the good news is God knows how to do the extraordinary things that you can't do on your own things that will Amaze you sometimes the reason we settle his life hasn't turned out the way we thought we going through disappointments unfair things have happened now we've lost our passion this is what happened to Abraham's father his name was Tara he had three sons one of those Sons a young man named Aaron died at an early age Tara went through this great disappointment of losing a son years later God told him to leave the place he was living and moved to Canaan the promised land he got his belongings family and he started out that way but when they came to the city of her on the same name as the son he lost instead of passing through the city set of continuing on to what the promised land the scripture says Tara settled in the city of her and he started out good but when he came to the place that reminded him of the loss of his son the place of disappointment he got so discouraged that he gave up on his dream Tara could have become the father of our faith he's the original one God told to go to the promised land not Abraham but because of the laws he chose to Sandler if you're going to reach your destiny you have to dig down deep and say yes I've been hurt but I'm not settling here I've been through disappointment but I'm not settling in self-pity I've been betrayed but I'm not settling in bitterness I lost a loved one it was painful but I'm not settling in despair I know God has Beauty for these ashes I know weeping endures for a night but joy is coming in the morning the truth is we've all had bad brakes we can all find a reason to live offended bitter angry but if you refuse to settle on the other side of that hurt is a new level of your destiny you have to press pass the pain press pass the disappointments press pass those Lonely Nights thoughts telling me it's never going to work out you seen your best days what if my father would have settled in poverty the way he was raised I wouldn't be up here what if my mother would have settled in despair when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer she wouldn't be alive what if Joseph would have settled in bitterness betrayed by his brothers he would have never become the prime minister of Egypt what if Ruth in the scripture would have settled in discouragement when she lost her husband she would have never met Beau as they would have never had a son that would become the great-grandfather of King David she would have never been in the family line of Jesus amazing things await you if you just don't settle you may have gone to disappointments life is throwing you a curve you have to get your fire back God did not bring you this far to leave you your greatest days in your health in your marriage and your career and your finances are still in front of you but the enemy would love for us to do like Abraham's father get so discouraged is so disappointed that we settle on the way to our destiny that we missed the fullness of what God has in store he's okay if you have Ishmael he doesn't want you to have Isaac this is what happened with the Israelites God brought them out of slavery they travel through the desert made it next door to the promised land God told them he would give them the victory but when they saw how big the people were when they heard all the negative reports the scripture says David came to discourage to believe instead of going in and taking the land they settled in the desert and yes God took care of them out there he provided for their needs I saw it smell but they never saw Isaac I believe many of you are next door to your Promised Land you're on the verge of seeing a new level of blessing and favor the question is are you going to settle there or you going to store your face up and say no I've come too far to stop now these Giants may be big but I know my God Is Bigger I may have had this sickness a long time this financial difficulty this trouble at work but I know God is still on the throne I will live and not die I will prosper and succeed as for me and my house we will serve the Lord I know today I'm not looking at Settler's I'm looking it over commerce I'm looking at more than conquerors I'm looking at Victoria's not big-time no not settling me mean going back to school getting training so your gifts can come out new ways it may mean developing your business plan meeting with mentors to bring about your goal or not settling for you may mean joining a support group to help break the addiction not learning to live with it but getting the help you need it may mean putting more effort into your marriage spending more time with the person God gave you the love perhaps not settling for you is going up to the gym taking walks at night instead of watching television being proactive to get back in shape but I wonder where you could be in 10 years if you just don't see who knows where God is taking you who knows the doors he's going to open the people you'll go to me the dreams you going to accomplish the gifts that are going to come out of you I'm more sobering thought where will you be in 10 years if you do send what will you miss if you settle in mediocrity settling dysfunction settle in self-pity in bitterness you will miss who you were created to be friends what's in front of you is way too important to settle God has your Isaac's he's already lined up your good breaks the healing the freedom the business. Do your part don't let good enough become good enough get your fire back and go after the destiny that belongs to you all right attitude should be I'm not going to settle next door to buy Promised Land I am going in I'm going to become all I was created to be if you'll do this I believe and declare Isaac is coming something more than you've imagined new levels in your career freedom from that addiction breakthroughs in your finances healing wholeness abundant the fullness of your destiny in Jesus name and if you receive it I'd like to give you an opportunity to meet Jesus the Lord of your life would you pray with me just say Lord Jesus I Repent of my sins come into my heart I make you my Lord and Savior if you put it that simple prayer we believe you got born again didn't a good Bible based Church keep God first place Victorian I'll be right back to speak a blessing over you thank you for listening to the Joel Osteen podcast help us continue to share the message of Hope with those all over the world visit joelosteen.com give hope to give a gift today thanks so much for listening to today's message I hope you'll subscribe so you can receive the latest podcast to keep you inspired all through the week we're praying for you I know God's best is still ahead we'll see you next time
