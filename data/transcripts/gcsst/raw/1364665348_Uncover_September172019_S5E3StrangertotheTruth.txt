Smith is retired now he was born and raised in Peterborough and he brought up his four kids there for most of his 36 years on the force he worked in his hometown when she first years name when did you get involved we were notified when he first moved to Peterborough area because he was already on probation for stalking another woman up and call them so he was he was on our radar right from the day he arrived in Peterborough he we just had a feeling that you want the first hint of trouble came when Tippett allegedly offered a 12 year old girl a fake job at the YMCA but she told her mom her mom called the police but no charges were laid this idea of a fake job brings back memories of sharmini show me Nia disappeared on the morning of what was supposed to be her first day of a new job after looking into it please determine the job wasn't real and the whole thing was a ruse but these were the only times Tibbett was accused of offering a fake job he approaches this girl in a lineup I think I'm at Walmart or something like that she was looking for a job once again new Canadian vulnerable and sulci at the YMCA and somehow gets around dress he starts dropping stuff off and then you Caesar I got Taco Bell and John. John YMCA in Hawaii the YMCA was like no there's no job openings here they called the police and that's when the bells and whistles when I'm off. Police moved in to arrest have it searched his home and seized his fan they discovered Tippett was using a fake name calling himself Jason and 4/8 days he pursued the woman that's when they found duct tape it is fan they found concealed knives a hammer under the driver seat rope plastic sheets and restraints in his home they found a pellet pistol hidden in the basement typically too guilty to criminal harassment and was sentenced to two years Justice Lauren Chester stated during sentencing that Tippett had designed a sophisticated plan for the fate of his victim he wrote quote yes I guess in a way there speculation about the pellet pistol hit in the basement and the plastic restraints and the ropes in the back of the van yes that might be considered speculation but under the circumstances perhaps it's not a Quantum Leap to think we are dealing with a situation that could have escalated into physical violence against the victim hi Michelle. I'm here to meet Stanley Tibbetts lawyer he works in a nondescript Mall in Mississauga a suburb just outside of Toronto all right so as you know my name is Haig derusha and I've been wearing for a long time called to the bar in Ontario 1984 and I've been doing some elements of criminal law ever since he and we talked for a long time Stanley is a person who has being challenged first of all with a syndrome is called Treacher Collins syndrome and what is a genetic type of disorder so he's born with it other members of his family have it it's not something I have but it is something that other members of the family have and it creates difficulties in hearing with deformed ears it creates difficulties in terms of the appearance because it it makes the eyes look unusual it is in a sense a a curse that someone has to carry around with Treacher Collins syndrome is there anything else about Stanley in terms of his growing up I think on the phone you would mention that he had some difficulty had been bullied at an early age can you pay a little bit more of a picture of is today early years we didn't live in the same community so I would see him at family events and he would be like any other person at a family event you talk about your life generally you talk about how things are going but I certainly got the impression that he was felt very challenged by by his situation Stanley is not mentally challenged to my knowledge in the terms of having low IQ but he is challenge because if you if you don't have the background in the ability to get into the college University system that limits you he has always had to face these challenges and that will happen for him the rest of his life in this case was Stanley he says I didn't do it I'm prepared to assume Stanley is telling the truth and I think everyone should in terms of shemini but Hank says that's not how the police or the media see it I can say that he was pursued by the police for years following Germany's murder and it's her murder is absolutely tragic of course it is but what has happened to Stanley because of her murder is also terrible because he's a suspect wherever he goes now if he is the perpetrator and you cannot find evidence to get him convicted in spite of all of these steps don't you have to acknowledge that he's not really the perpetrator that he is innocent and but he's not labeled Innocent by the public because of the newspaper reporting about how he's a suspect and if you cannot find enough evidence to convict or try to charge at least the suspect that you have at the time and you follow them and you assemble everything you can and 6 months or a year goes by and you still haven't got enough evidence to charge him and 5 years goes by in 10 years goes by and you still don't have enough managed to charge them don't you have to let acknowledge that that you you probably been going down the wrong road or that there's no reason why that they should be labeled this suspect and be presumed to be a a a a dangerous person any longer stop asking you questions well I went to that school at the end of June in 2007 Rosemary Hanks was a principal at St John Catholic Elementary School in Peterborough it had just enrolled three of his five children when you met Stanley and his wife it was very uncomfortable he was fairly aggressive he was he tried to make himself out to be very clever and was basically trying to tell me what would be happening and he and he was very dominating of his wife at this point Rosemary didn't know anything about tippet she just had a feeling that something wasn't right then she got a call of parent phone to school anonymously and said that did we realize who this person was and we didn't end I think the person sent us newspapers or else told us to check online Rosemary read that tip it had been a suspect in Germany's death and that police believe he learned her way with the offer of a fake job and then there was a case in Peterborough and when she done something similar with but she was a 19 or 20 something like that year old girl that he had come across in the Walmart I think so we knew that we had to really be very careful around him that he he had this propensity to Target young girls so we increase the supervision of the yard and he was frequently seen on the yard or he would be at the fence looking at watching when I was recess I also the staff was not allowed to speak with him alone for two reasons one is I want it to be there cuz I didn't think it was fair for them to be in that position and secondly he was never a truthful so we need another Witness did you talk to the police at all during this time throughout the whole year yes he was always trying to charm his way in with students and and it would you would find them in odd places in the school or in the school grounds and we don't say you're going to be here but it always seemed like he would try to find a way to be in a place so that he could be watching the students did you ever hear reports of what he would tell the students I got a report from a teacher that we had a page Co-op student from the local high school the teacher was concerned that he would be talking to her befriending her being funded Community police officer and when the school board as a result of that we were able to serve a no-trespass order did he ever reach it yes he did he came one day he brought a lunch supposedly one of the children had forgotten and lunch so he came in through the front door and came to the office to get my ass if you can't be in here and you know you can't be in here so I followed him up to his fan I said Stanley you know you cannot come into the school I don't see what you need got very argumentative like this is ridiculous and he just became pretty aggressive and then I said no you cannot come and I'm informing the community police officer that you were here but I did take the lunch and took it in but I thought it was just ever see it was something he thought of as a way to get into the school Rosemary had a terrible feeling that when the school year was over it would not be the last time she care of tibbitts he's incorrigible as far as we could see he was very deceptive very manipulative and he just I don't think he can help himself less than a year later she would hear his name on the news another bizarre twist today at the Peterborough court house that's worth 32 year-old Stanley to that made his first court appearance accused of abducting and sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl Tibbetts van was found by police Wednesday after it was spotted racing from the court has high school where the 12 year old was assaulted I got called in in the middle of the night we had a missing girl has been abducted this is Dan Smith the Peterborough, we were just about ready to put an amber alert I know we were had an idea based on description you don't because it's really when people describe Stanley bring the scrap price the red van and his facial features on the steak Bowl as we're getting our ducks in a row in the morning they've got a caller on the phone who wants to come in and take over the related to what we were just kidding internet she tossed and turned in my office and and I recognize his voice and trying to tell me that he had his van was stolen then I want to find a word what I want to get to him before he could even so I started having I was with him according to a court judgement tip it was driving home just after midnight and he stumbled upon these two young girls they were very drunk one a 12 year old was so drunk she needed help walking tip it offered them a ride in his van he dropped off one girl at a park and then he drove off with a 12 year old that was more of a a crime of opportunity you know he came across these 12 and 13 year old girl the judge concluded almost from the first moment of encounter Mr tippet begin to ice later from her friends by means of Lies like I'm phoning the police and I'll take her to the hospital these lies enhance his ability to isolator and sexually assault her temperature of almost an hour away to the town of Curtis Ontario there he stopped at a local high school and he parked his van neighbors heard the child screaming no and please and I called police at 2 a.m. one caller said the screaming voice it wasn't the sound of a young person horsing around when police first arrived at the school they walked along a path that separates the school from a wooded area and also saw a van in the school's back parking lot and then a person walking towards the van when he shouted police and stop the man jumped into his van and drove away to avoid the police cruiser the van's driver drove over the curb and became airborne the news footage from the scene you can see broken car parts on the road the van took off the officer followed speeds reached as high as a hundred kilometers an hour on the Sleepy residential streets of Curtis eventually the chase was called off because it became too dangerous but not before the officer was able to get the license plate and a good look at the driver he later identified him as Tibbett noting that the physical features of his head and face were very distinctive the van it was registered to tip it back at the wooded area outside the school police found a child stumbling around she was confused and intoxicated she had no idea where she was her shirt was torn she was naked from the waist down as he was being led out of court this morning 33 year-old Stanley Tippett insisted the judge was wrong tip it was found guilty inside Justice Bruce glass pronounced guilty on all seven counts including kidnapping sexual assault and sexual interference the lead detective spoke just outside the courtroom after the verdict came down as an investigator it's it's difficult to manage an offender like him and we're just pleased with the verdict today for sure to this date if it maintains that he did not attack the child yes he says he picked her up in those early morning hours but only because he wanted to help she insists he was not only wrongly convicted but he was also a victim of a crime cheers Tibbetts version of what happened he picked up the two girls he dropped one off and then he was carjacked by two men and driven around for a bit then the men thrown out of the van and they took off with the girl Tippett says he landed in a ditch and had to climb out he walked for a bit then he phoned his wife and she called him a cab then he took the cab to his uncle's house and it was from there he called Peterborough detective Dan Smith to report the carjacking those two people would also know if there are two other people that committed this offense and not Stanley so that's three people on the planet this is Hector urrutia again Tibbetts lawyer and cousin other than that nobody on the planet I can imagine would know not the young girl because she says she was drinking and she's not accustomed to drinking I guess and she was basically blacked out or still functioning I suppose but has no recollection and cannot assist in describing how it is that she was I'm sexually assaulted I guess the question is do you believe in this case was Stanley he says I didn't do it I have no personal knowledge as to who did it in terms of I wasn't there so I can't form an information about what happened because I was a witness or I was there so I'm prepared to assume Stanley is telling the truth and I think everyone should police found to use condoms inside the abandoned van and the victim's clothes nearby do you want to say anything but the judge's decision what do you think your chances on a Fueler while DNA was collected there was never enough to make a match for anybody other than the victim was there ever a moment when he's going through this abduction story that you think okay this is this is absolutely ludicrous but maybe like I have to keep an open mind maybe maybe there's something to did you ever for just a nanosecond think that there's no way but in my view we have so much evidence to suggest that it didn't happen based on on everything this again is retired Peterborough detective Dan Smith every time his lips moved it was a lie than that involved weiners we knew what he was capable. We knew you know Miss Manners so dangerous immediately after tippit was convicted of sexually assaulting and kidnapping a 12 year old girl the crown applied to have him declared a dangerous offender they wrote in their application Mr tippet is a stranger to the truth as part of his pattern of repetitive aggressive and sexual behavior he lies to his targets his wife doctors Children's Aid Society officials police officers and the court do I say anything but the judge's decision no comment from Stanley Tippett as he leaves the courthouse Justice Bruce glass says Tippett would reoffend if he was ever released from prison but he's obsessed with sex and the community isn't safe you are declared a dangerous offender in Canada if the court believes it's not safe for you to be released even after you finished your sentence the judge says over the years Tippets crimes escalated from setting fire to a teacher's desk in the early 1990s to kidnapping and sexually assaulting a drunk 12 year old girl in 2008 dangerous offenders can apply for parole but it's rarely granted October 31st 2011 Stanley Tippett was designated a dangerous offender say don't think you should ever come out of jail I think there are rehabilitated by believe wholeheartedly 100% that Batman can never ever step foot in inches size of putting people at risk you've been on the force for 36 years have you ever met anybody like him before never never never have I met a man like him and dealt with a lot of serious offenders never am I ever come across a person like Stanley Cup when I interviewed tippet 20 years ago I knew very little about his past I was focused on the details of Charmaine he's murder and his alibis on the day she went missing I asked all the questions I cut but now we've learned about his crimes both before charmilles death and after how there's this pattern of impersonating cops of harassment and attempts of luring young women with fake jobs there's so much more to ask him now next time on a cover sherwani Hi how are you do you want me to put a belt table tipping uncover sharmini is written and produced by myself Michelle Shepherd and Kathleen gold her our associate producer is Alina Ghosh are audio producer is Mitchell Stewart are digital producer is Judy xeku Chris Oak is our story editor or video producer is Evan a Girl by Rosh Hashanah and Carroll Park our senior producer of CBC podcast is Tanya Springer an executive producer is are ignorant if you like this season of uncover checkout uncover the village for years men were disappearing from Toronto gay Village Police said they weren't connected but they were and it turns out that was only the beginning of this story subscribe to uncover wherever you get your podcast four more CBC original podcasts go to cbc.ca original podcasts
