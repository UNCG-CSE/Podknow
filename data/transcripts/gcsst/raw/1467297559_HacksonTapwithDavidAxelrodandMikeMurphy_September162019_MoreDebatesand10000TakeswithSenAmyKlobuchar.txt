a pull up a chair tax on tap with David Axelrod and Mike Murphy Mike Murphy how you doing brother I'm doing good acts I'm doing good I'm I'm a little worried looking at the world situation complicated politics in the Middle East just with President Trump was created to handle and of course we're we're back to the Supreme Court nomination battle again are we in the Wayback machine a lot of stuff to cover because we we we now have the aftermath of the debate and we got to go through it and see what what it all meant but yeah Kavanaugh back in the news and New Revelations in a book by a couple of New York Times reporters suggesting that evidence additional evidence was overlooked by the FBI maybe by the Senate Judiciary Committee President Trump at energetically leaped into that debate and lasted Mitch McConnell table at the far left and besmirch Inus good man Buffet at least four Democratic presidential candidates may be 5 immediately called for Kavanaugh impeachment what do you think the politics of this is this is classic bass food on the right the conservatives they like Kavanaugh they think you got a bum rap they're not sure I think if they were honest about it about what happened all those decades ago is a drunken college student but they think he's letting exemplary life since then and they're seeing an attempt to bring a can opener the Supreme Court in on the other hand the Democratic beso use somebody who lied and is guilty of sexual assault and therefore I get why the Democratic candidates are piling on but in the general election I don't know again this is yet another thing that Republicans will create a wedgie issue out of for being a conservative you he's being totally maligned I it's messy and it is the incentives hour to fight like everything in our politics now believe that that whole process was was was really suspect and that they didn't thoroughly investigate but you would you talk to Claire mccaskill in some of the Democrats who lost in 2018 and they would say that they had momentum until the Kavanaugh Hearing in that really stoked up the Republican base so as a matter of politics it's a year I could base politics in if you are running in the Democratic primary it's a good place to be to call for impeachment I look forward to talking with our guest today Amy Klobuchar who was on who's on the Senate Judiciary Committee played a big role in those cabinet hearings to hear what she has to say about it you mentioned me the Middle East this thing where they ran as really ratcheted up now they are there was an attack on the Saudi oil installation the houthi rebels from Yemen claim credit for it but it looks like a pretty sophisticated attack in the administration immediately blames a ranen word let word out that they're considering all options including military options where is this all go well that's a billion dollar question is an interesting one because the uranians in the Saudis have been having this proxy war for a while fighting it out in Yemen although there's some evidence that the missile which apparently could have been in a rainy and copy of a Ukrainian Russian missile they bought on the black market a cruise missile could have come from Southern Iraq from the north so this thing is escalating and it could be we could have retaliation by the Saudis or armed to the teeth and they even there are allies some American participation I think prison at Trump if you're a cynic might want to change the subject a little bit on the other hand the Iranians are escalating their troublemaking so if we have an election that suddenly about turn policy that could Shuffle the deck and then yeah I know it's really complicated because Trump is a guy who ran on non engagement on withdrawing from these foreign Bowser maybe people believe that New York since it involves oil and gas prices which are going to go up inevitably that that will that he needs to to act but I think it's a really tough call for him I remember being in the white house and I remember what the military people said about what would a war with Iran would really look like and it is not this is not Iraq where you just kind of knock out there are yep and these are serious these are serious foes what you start with the chain of escalation you don't know where it stops that is surprising that you committed American forces to it I don't know but the fool who wins does a candidate like if Biden does he say he's Captain foreign policy me repeat the veteran I think it Shuffle the deck a little for the DL who knows where we'll be in a year with a 1 election that it may affect is Israeli election Bibi Netanyahu sup on Tuesday he is hole in one of his predicate is the threat the Mortal threat that it ran poses to Israel Donald Trump's very popular there little saber rattling in advance of that is not it's not a bad thing I remember once I have even tried to hire me and I was unable to do it but we had an interesting conversation and his beer which I thought was correct is that the fulcrum point of Israeli politics is always the topic of the election if it's domestic stuff it labor the opposition does well but if it security that I could and Bebe does well in that it does seem to be playing into his hands in the polls show baby having a little come back then just last week just last week he had a a pressure disclosing what he said were unknown here to heretofore unknown in terranean you know nuclear facilities and so you know he's leaning into that so we'll see what happens with that but we had some country attempts of our own of a different kind last week in that democratic debate I want to get to that in a minute but first I want to talk about insurance well you know actually it is National Life Insurance month I bet you didn't know that most people don't that's why 40% of people don't even think about life insurance and don't have any and people really should think about it cuz right

because in this last debate the stakes were so high for many of them they're starting to run out of money they got to break through and I think a few of them did pretty well I called the night of the understudies because the Bookers the klobuchar's me repeat even they don't had a bit of a comeback and may not be enough but I thought they did a good job kind of getting into the race for one last charge interesting things about it was this is the first time that we've actually seen people draw very hard philosophical radiological limes and one of them was around this medicare-for-all proposal that Bernie Sanders has in Elizabeth Warren has indoors and people really pick that apart let's listen to Senator Klobuchar who we're going to hear from later and while Bernie rosabell I read the bill and on page eight page eight of the bill it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it and that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current Insurance that's in four years I don't think that's a bold idea I think it's a bad idea you know this became a flare Point early in the debate between Joe Biden and Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who are his to closest competitor it was really interesting the formulation that he chose I think we should have a debate on Healthcare I think I know that the senator says she's for Bernie well I'm from Barack I think the Obamacare work what I was saying and what app are you know from polling suggests is a really strong argument is he was for building out the Affordable Care Act not for not for Medicare for all Witchwood and private insurance in 4 years it's interesting no one's really touched those two on this here Elizabeth Warren did a good job of talking around whether it would require significant new taxes on the middle class just single reduce expenses on The Middle I thought she navigated that well but just going to continue to be a problem for them I think in the in the coming months yeah I thought it was a really telling moment I thought the first hour of the bay was the Best Buy in we've seen I thought he did a good job with a how do you pay for it refrain and for the first time in one of these campaign debates I saw Elizabeth Warren a Droid is she is a bit on the defense nobody smelled to do that to her yet and they're even parts of the bait was she kind of disappeared so I don't think your performance cost for anything but I don't think it was one of her better nights and for the first half I think buying did well is very clever to make a medicare-for-all now a referendum on are you for or against Barack Obama in his plan I mean that that really gives the non medicare for all people something to work with so I thought we saw those politics change a little bit and that could affect Warren's trajectory going forward by the way Obama had a very good debate for a guy who wasn't going to State everyone was in after previous. where there was a lot of sort of inferential criticism of the Obama policies people are tripping over each other trying to say nice things about him I kind of disagree with you on Warren I thought that that that was a trick he passed that she had to navigate on Healthcare but I thought she had a good debate for one specific reason you look at Elizabeth Warren polling numbers and she's doing very well with upper-income Highly Educated people with very liberal voters and with young people she's not broken through a particularly with white working-class voters African-American voters she Trails Biden by double digits in in the case of African-Americans biomass of number and so she took this opportunity to burnish her biography which I think is her whole card here in terms of trying to break through with each other voters you said before she has to be less the professor from Harvard and more you know that fighting grandma from Oklahoma on your right sheet started to play the biomotiv card let's listen to it let's listen to some of that song I was born and raised in Oklahoma but I'm sure glad to be in Texas tonight all three of my brothers served in military bases here in Texas that was their ticket to the middle class I got my big opportunity about a half mile down the road from here at the University of Houston back when it cost $50 a semester for a price that I could pay for on a part-time waitressing job I got to finish my 4 year degree and I became a special needs teacher I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher I can tell you what those babies look like I had for 46 year olds but I was visibly pregnant and back in the day that meant as a principal said to me wish me luck and hired someone else for the job and the reason I'm standing here today is because I got back up I fought back I know what's broken I want to be in the fight to fix it in America yeah that's exactly what she needs to be doing a lot more of them she's going to pull off the pivot from the Harvard faculty lounge and I thought you wasn't right at it I just never heard around the defensive the little bit on Medicare for all before and it shouldn't have to fix that it listen I write what I find really interesting is Elizabeth Warren who has a plan for everything has not offered her own plan on on Healthcare yet and I think that there's going to come a time in this campaign when she is going to present a much more nuanced plan on Healthcare that helps her Escape some of the downtown side of the Sanderson we should note that Bernie Sanders was Bernie Sanders and that he had a you know he I always say Bernie Sanders is the Billy Joel of of this race he he he people come to see him to hear the greatest hits of the 70s 80s 90s and and he is very consistent in delivering on that and there's an authenticity to it so he was raspy voice that hindered him in the debate but my guess is that to the 15% or 18% of people who say they're for Bernie he did just fine. No you're right about that Bernie's Bernie he's got his chunk and they're going to like to hear the heads still think Bernie Goetz little credit for is yeah one of the things that's off-putting to me about Warren is she has a little bit of a trumpian style demagogue a thing where every problem goes back to taxing some rich people when a guy after paying for all the free college text rich people when it got to paying for the new healthcare plan or everything is going to be really inexpensive and wonderful tax the rich people Bernie will go out there and tell you yeah I'm going to soak the hell out of these people and pay for it and we're going to do it now he paints and Vivid color and he involved that you know I've spoken to a few of your Republican buddies in the last week and there is a sense that you know well everybody says warms populism will limit her ability to win they're concerned about her cutting in ultimately on some of Trumps base just because there is a common theme of the system being rigged against the middle class I don't know if it will work out that way but if this is it's it's it's it's big and we don't know if she's going to be the nominee it's it's pretty interesting do you know I said dressing I subscribe to that theory because I think she is a very risky nominee for the Democrats in the year where why would you want risk cuz she gives Trump something to work with but and she's pugilistic at a time when people don't necessarily want more pugilism but exactly fighter fighter fighter her answer always has that word 20 times but that said if she can't have it to the fight and Grandma and get big is bad populism which is a third cousin of Trumps she could win the general election I don't think like a lot of Republicans it's impossible I think I guess the other big thing of the debate is buying old way down at the end of the stage old Castro decided to help the RNC out again like you did in the first debate by making everybody raise their hands on decriminalizing borders by essentially calling the vice president knighted states senile what's your what's your take on the the Castro attack well let's listen to let's listen to that exchange and I would not require them to opt-in they would automatically be enrolled they wouldn't have to buy in that's a big difference because Barack Obama's Vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered he wanted every single person in this country covered my plan would do that your plan would not have to buy in they do not have to buy it just said that you just said that 2 minutes ago you just said 2 minutes ago that they would have to buy it you said they would have to buy it to buy in if she qualifies forgetting what you said to me to pay in for repeated that a couple of times for emphasis so it wasn't as if it wasn't sort of intentional and it was clearly calling a by now as as sort of addleton as addled and old you know a thing about it was first hope I had a colorable argument that he was right in Castro was wrong about what he said so rude and wrong or if that's a very bad, you know Castro sitting down there 1% and he was throwing long trying to get into the mix but I think he he hurt himself there first time in a long career in this racket that I've seen somebody not only blow up their dormant and probably hopeless presidential campaign but also blow up there more promising vice presidential campaign in the same 22nd see how they may give Joe the nomination or they may give him a gold watch at the end of this but either way he is a popular beloved guy in the Democratic party and it was a cheap shot ya it was a cheap shot the and I am you know we've had Julio Castro on the show I like him very much I think that was that was ill-advised it did raise a question though didn't it yeah either subjects of it was bad providing I think is everybody's talking about it now and and the fact is this was a very long debate I think it went on for 15 hours or maybe 3 hours and and bite you know yes you said he was very energetic and an hour one by the end he seemed exhausted and he there was there was a question about race at the end of the debate and it's always been so touchy somehow he's very reactive to those questions understands that his base is very much in the African American Community but he gave a Meandering answer in this is a piece of what he says listen a kid coming from a very poor School are a very poor background will hear 4-minute words you were spoken by the time I get there yeah so this is part of the hail of words that didn't necessarily make a lot of sense in the context of the question now I know you're a vinyl guy so you probably have a record player but you know a lot of people don't have record players in the morning and it really felt like just to make the record player reference that by the end of the night he was moving at 16 RPMs and everybody else was at 45 I think he's going to only campaign in Brooklyn vinyl shops now to connect himself look I thought he was going to finish with and get the grandkids and watch a talky together you know it was with one click away from the President Reagan's famous Meandering discussion of the Pacific Coast Highway but Reagan one so yeah, that is built into Joe but these things build up and the new expectations form is Christmas going forward because well cancel blue himself up the issue you raised is now here it's been lurking in the background for a while and sound abiding to knock it down yeah yeah so another interesting development in that debate or you know where's the re-emergence of Beto O'Rourke after the tragic massacre in his hometown of El Paso he seems to have found his voice and may not be a voice that leads him to the nomination but one particular question he was very passionate and got a lot of note let's listen to that are you proposing taking away their guns and how would this work I am if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield and in Odessa I met the mother of a 15 year old girl who was shot by an AR-15 at mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in I'm hell yes we're going to take your AR-15 your AK-47 so that was a big moment and it resonated with a lot of Democrats and a lot of people who are concerned about why these weapons of war are are on our street that said they're all too loud exhaust and Republicans who who clip that and are using it to motivate their own base and first of all what do you make of Betos Resurgence and secondly as a as a fallen are what do you what do you make of of of this issue and you put it together with Medicare for all the yeah the Border stuff I believe he believes it in the passion and authenticity is giving him a jumpstart in the Democratic primaries he'll probably turn it into a little bit ago now the problem is these debates have been a factory for potential Republican wedge issues we have the decriminalize Border slave reparations confiscating private insurance which is how the is Warframe medicare-for-all and now an issue that Democratic strategist at least in the past maybe gun politics of totally changed my guess is they having the idea of mandatory you know seizure of of of guns you don't want to go into a Midwestern swing state with that message so this thing is going to get Factory for the Republican operatives and I can tell you they're high-fiving each other cuz they know the country wants to fire Trump and they're looking for a path to make the election something else and so Beto you know it's short term I get it I think it's legitimate is what he believes but long-term oh it's risky nitroglycerin they're playing with yeah I do think I'm politics of change but maybe not to that that much and we know that we know that there's you know huge support for Universal background checks and some other steps may be limiting ammunition for summarize the but the but the cop the confiscation of Guns is a is a you know what is a problem I will say this battle lost in this presidential race for months and he seems to have found his role here as a passionate you know what you would say truth-teller he believes what he's saying I saw him on a Meet the Press yesterday and asked him about Biden's age and he gave a really passionate answer about all the things that that are going on right now that we should be addressing and you know it was very young but you know beyond that or just you know not that and you know it was really really strong my guess is he gets a little bump here getting ready for some money and sell some tickets and you can feel the nervousness among the other Democratic understudy level candidates who were kg and have an i in the general election mayor Pete distancing himself from this Klobuchar why I thought I had a pretty good night going on the offense from the center for the first time and distancing herself on a mandatory take back so this is going to be a head versus heart thing and they're going to be plenty of Democratic primary voters are going to go with heart but if feeding Trump is the big mission that that can be an expensive Hobby and speaking of heart one of the really moving closing statements in Houston came from Amy Klobuchar who talked about her biography and some of the struggles that she's overcoming life in the lessons that she learned from them let's take a listen to that night challenges and resilience have brought me up here I grew up with the dad is struggled with alcoholism his whole life and after his third DWI get a choice between jail and treatment he chose treatment with his Freight Faith with his friends with our family and in his words he was pursued by grace and that made me interested in public service because I feel like everyone should have that same right to be pursued by grace and then got married my husband is out there somewhere hopefully smiling and our daughter and our daughter was born I had this expectation we're going to have his perfect perfect birth and she was really sick and she couldn't swallow and she was in and out of hospitals for a year-and-a-half but when she was born they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours she was in intensive care and I was kicked out and I thought this could never happen to any other mom again so I went to the legislature our state legislature not an elected official and Mom and I advocated for one of the first laws in the country guarantee new moms and their babies a 48-hour Hospital stay and when they tried to delay the implementation of Outlaw I brought six friends pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumber the lobbyists 2 to 1 and when they said when should it take place I'll raise her hand and said now that is what motivated me to go into public service and now with us from South Alana is senator Amy Klobuchar Amy Klobuchar great to have you here you're coming to us from South Carolina and you're dizzy and tour of states and we appreciate you taking the time so before we get into the race itself there is the story kicking around this morning about Justice Kavanaugh and some unreported and apparently unreviewed evidence that your committee did not get a chance to consider and some of your colleagues have already called for impeachment proceedings and I'm wondering what your view is having actually been part of that proceeding no one was better known for having to deal with his hearing than me and no one got hit and to the point where the nominee had to apologize to me than I did when I was simply trying to ask him some questions about whether he may have blacked out and that's why he couldn't remember what happened and he been hit back at me and said while view blocked out he later apologized I'm and since that time I have taken a very strong position that this hearing and how this whole thing went down I was a sham there was not proper wedding we weren't able to see all the documents and then when we had that second opportunity to look at documents it was in a basement room and we could only look at it for an hour and then the other party came in for an hour and then we could go back for an hour you couldn't even write down notes that you could take out with you and it really was an unbelievable thing it was all the FBI tips accident be 1090 tips and then there'd be one real document of someone that had called in and you had no idea what had been investigated and what didn't and so I have always taken the position that those documents should be have been forwarded to the committee like a normal background check and they weren't and that's what I think needs to happen here if you really want to look into these allegations they are the same that was a case of course I'd come out at that time but the New York Times seems to have Unearthed some new information we should get those documents and once you are able to look at all of this and have an appropriate investigation then a decision could be made by the House of Representative about what they want to do with it and I just think that is the proper way to do this and prematurity cause premature to call for impeachment well I think you can you can't do the impeachment even if you want to unless you have the underlying information and you're able to look at it again I love the people that are saying all he should be you should step down wide like a lot of these people to step down I buy President Trump to step down right about a lot of this is making sure if you're going to go forward with that that you actually have the information to do it and that decision would rest with the house but it's good politics right I mean doesn't it doesn't resonate with some of the base of the democratic party to call for impeachment right now stations for how I am running my campaign and you know this is I'm running my campaign based on what I think we need to do is a country in the only way any of this changes that we gets justices that respect the law in place after we get something done on climate change and gun safety in doing something about pharmaceutical prices is if we have a president of its going to wake up everyday thinking about what's best for the American people instead of what's best for themselves and the only way we really get this stuff done is if we also make sure we have a house and that Mitch McConnell is not the majority leader and the only way you do that is by focusing on bread and butter issues because these are real States these are states that we're going to have to take back from Republicans in Arizona and Colorado State we need to keep like Alabama so we don't just need to win we need to win Senator hi Mike Murphy here let me ask you a question about all that cuz I've watched your campaign with interest I'm in this Pizarro world of being a rebel anti Trump Republican suffix not I'm not normally semi routing for a Democrat and I've said since the beginning I think you're one of the strongest general election campaign candidates the party can almond said that behind your back too by the way the first half of the primary here you've struggled a bit you got other candidates or more famous better-funded I did see you step it up in the debate a little more about drawing distinction she didn't go there with Beto on the idea of mandatory BuyBacks II content on this impeachment thing you're moving a little slower than some of your more excited competitors are you ramping it up now to draw more ideological differences what's your strategy to get to that top three in Iowa between now and then to try to break through is it more ideological play if I told you my house strategy I might not get there but I will say that was staged to make my case and I've been clear about this you know if you are someone that wants to kick 149 million people off their insurance in 4 years or current Insurance then I'm not your candidate or if you think wealthy kids should get free college that I'm not your candidate if you want a 16 trillion dollar package some of our very important issues on climate change where I think I have a much better plans when we only have a 20 trillion dollar economy then I'm not your candidate and so I think it's really important that you have someone that is running for the people who are tired of the Extremes in our politics are people who feel stuck in the middle of this and that's the case I'm going to make and it is a somewhat unique case on that stage and I'm going to keep doing it big that is where the vast majority of people are that's how we won the governor's race in Kansas that candidate Laura Kelly who is now the governor of beat Kris kobach she wasn't famous she wasn't celebrity candidates she just understood that states and was able to win the same thing and how we beat Scott Walker in Wisconsin hockey stayed in the general election I'm so that is the case that I'm going to make is that I don't want to be present for half of America I want to be present for all of America let me ask you a question political question can can Democrats shock it must be a Monday morning thing I don't know if the Democrats win are you concerned about the positions that you heard on the stage given what you just said Can Democrats win by advocating of medicare-for-all plan of the sword that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren that advocated can they win on the platform of decriminalizing a border crossings up you heard Betos call and I think it resonate with a lot of people cuz that people are so horrified about what we've seen but in the end of the day and Murphy would know better than I have you seem like things that Republicans could have a Heyday when I'm not going to be dependent are you guys are better at that than me but I just look at it policy-wise and I think a lot of these things are bold ideas I think they're bad ideas and I have ideas that are truly bolt let's look at guns getting the universal background checks in place that we've been trying to do for decades that would be a bowl big idea getting forward now these things I think we could do not right but allowing police officers to properly vet people when they apply for permits making sure that domestic abusers aren't able to go and get an AK-47 if they've been convicted those are things we could do right now but I think an assault weapon ban and doing something about magazine limit of those are bold idea and so that's where I would go with this and other people are going to have different ideas but I think these ideas are strongly supported now especially the universal background checks by the majority of Voters in this country so why don't we get those things when you go around when you when you when you travel or what what kind of reaction do you get to this these ideas in your critique of some of the ideas that you've rejected I'm people actually are they want to win right so they are willing to listen to other ideas I think one of the problems with the debates until this one is that it's been about what are burning Elizabeth ideas and how does everyone else respond I think in this debate you were starting to hear some of the other candidates put forward their own ideas and have some back and forth on it because otherwise it just becomes one set of universal view and then everyone of just he's there is like on the sidelines throwing darts at it I don't think that's what a debate is I think it debate should be which idea is better and that's what we're starting to hear and I think once they do that that's where I'm betting on me once I do that plus the fact that I can win in those Midwestern states and I'm from the Midwest and one of only two candidates up on the stage from the Midwest that they're going to listen because the one thing that unites our party and bring Republican spent most of the candidates are talking about that we need to win one thing and they just want to make sure there's an alternative that there's a vision that there's some ideas that are going to sell some of these problems that we're not dealing with our allies dealing with the world can safety in climate change all these things that this President is blocked at and it said us backward especially when it comes to our position in the world economically and how he's dealing with China and the trade war in the effect it's having on our workers where he's now built up an 891 billion dollar trade deficit biggest one in history as well as a humongous stats forecast get this in 10 years that dad is going to be our country's debt is going to be worse than it has been at any point then right after World War II where we at a major war hang on Center because I know you have a limited time and we put in a quarter and got 10 plays there so I know Mike has a question for you at work I got to get back to the political question here I think you got a little little heat off the debate now looking at the Iowa caucus clearly Vice President Biden Elizabeth Warren or kind of sitting at top it when you're out there campaigning what do you throw out the competition is where you can draw the best contrast is it you and me repeat you and Senator Harris Senator Booker cuz you know there are other senators are there other Midwestern is there what's your Edge to make that top there spoke at one of the African American Church Union Baptist in Des Moines and there are so many people and it shows them the poles if you really push them who I have not yet decided choosing between a few candidates so I think this is just begun and I think that's what you're certainly thing in New Hampshire and you know this David from your work with President Obama where they really don't always make decisions till the end yeah I know that's a painful memory for me actually but you thank you you are one of the obstacles you have it seems to me is that the moderate voters if you look at polling moderate and conservative voters are Serta flocking to Vice President Biden he's got a commanding lead among those voters isn't there isn't one of the products of your candidacy that if if he should in some way stumble or people turn away from him then that lane opens up seems pretty tough for you to to move move up in a big way there if he's soaking up a lot of that boat doctor says I already mention I wanted only to Tana dates from the Midwest with a history I've never losing read congressional district never even Michele Bachmann's I've always wanted them and I've won the big the second thing is that I'm one of only three women on the stage that makes me different and the third thing which I think is more subtle but important is I am next generation of politicians I'm someone that is actually live through this Trump E R Us and get it I've been able to win in the Trump era and I've also been able to navigate Republicans during that time and passed over 30 bills were in the lead Democrat since President Trump has been in and I think that's important case to make to the people of this country that you're able to stand your ground but also find common ground and even some Democrats care about that and that's what I'm banking on your in your in South Carolina this morning and that obviously is an important state fourth in the primary calendar in the first were African Americans really are a dominant constituency vice-presidents getting half that vote right now you're kind of an asterisk there it would be a high-class problem for you to have to worry about that because it would mean that you did very well in Iowa and New Hampshire but you got some hostile questions in that debate about being a prosecutor in a time when people are very sensitive to this notion of up of mass incarceration in the Injustice of the justice system to compete I have an economic agenda here David that I think is a winner for an African American Community because I come from not a rich background I'm someone that had to fight for everything to get to where I was and my grandpa was an iron ore Miner and we wouldn't be where we are today except for Education stay with my husband he grew up in a trailer home with five brothers and so the case that I make is that right now Donald Trump with his tax cuts for the wealthy and everything else isn't helping lift people up and isn't giving them the kind of opportunities having certainly is rhetoric doesn't do that all that would change when I'm present his approach when it comes to voting African Americans are never going to see the table fit Camp vote in the way he has supported Governors that supports gerrymandering and has been opposed to reauthorize in the voting right act all that's important as for my back with criminal justice I think you saw me strongly when I was in those eight years we reduced the incarceration of African-Americans prison prison sentences by 12% because I focus on white collar crime because I use drug court a lot which is to me a big solution for a lot of people that have issues in the criminal justice system and I've been a strong advocate for reducing criminal offenses in allowing people to vote when they get out and then the final thing I pointed out was the African American Community came to me when I first got in and said our kids have been killed Street porches they've been killed in their houses and we want someone that's going to see Justice and not just ignore our communities and what I did with them and we put a lot of bad people behind bars I made a solemn pledge about his own pledge to your staff to let you go I just want to finish on this year you I saw you on CNN after of the debate and you said that the Julian Castro attack on Biden was not cool which I very much agree with but it's Biden's some stamina and Acuity and age do those things matter I mean he did get a little lost at the end there on his answer on race and you may I mean vinyl is back so you may have record players but most people most people don't I mean is that a concern because you're choosing the candid as you point out that's going to have to go up against Donald Trump and that's no easy task and they're going to be in about that I am running my own campaign and I pointed out my differences in terms of my background with a vice-president where I live Where I Come From the fact that I'm a woman the fact that I can someone that has been able to mount of Victories and bring people with me including Independence and moderate Republicans through the trumpy rat not just before it's through it and have been able to give voice to the concerns of people whatever party there in that have been hit by this guy in the White House and that includes soybean Farmers is guts soybeans mounting up in bins all over the middle of the country to immigrant workers in our hospitals who you know go to bed crying because of something to present a United States said about them Orcs said about people that look like them or you know the seniors who are keeping their insulin drops in their injectors cuz I can't afford it the new generation referencing earlier but I will I will let that I will let that go and I will let you go because I know you have another one of these very very long days of campaigning ahead of you so but kind of Q&A with students I'm looking forward to that I'll be making the case that you and I just talked about about the importance and just go ahead and all over the state some chips good good have a great day so special I can look forward to seeing you down the line thank you well David you were going to get the Amy Klobuchar to stump one that was interesting she's such a tough potential candidate in the general but there's this authenticity thing and when you do the wind up and beat him down with the routine it undercuts at it's not in the manner near I think how you move the needle to talk and yeah she doesn't depart from her talking points some of her talking points are pretty compelling you know I think she makes a pretty good argument for what a strong general election candidate would look like but but when you ask her to kind of make make the point more finally and she are she's reluctant to do it I find her to be somewhat conflict-averse and that's happened at situation like this you know yeah I agree she just won't get off the script and you know you understand why there's risk in that but it do you get into the robotic talking points I agree they're pretty good talking points but a lot of them are the old argument of I'm electable because I've done this at it it's not a way to get an emotional connection with voters and it's you know there's a reason that she hasn't caught on so far she has an opportunity to do it but she seems more at home in the Senate speechifying modem and Ashley as we said before she came on she had a powerful clothes in the debate and then it was very much a revealing about her as a person she's got to do more than she's got to be willing to draw more of a contrast but she was good to come on with us and up raps will hear from her again down the line and she'll have refined that pitch because she undoubtedly will listen to you're very wise staff didn't tell her we pay by the word they're going to be disappointed but I I've said from the beginning of the general election she'd be so top so we're saying she's got her shot coming right now and I'll tell you one thing of Amy

topic of male we did not do a mail bag last time so we're going to try our new speed mailbag get to a couple of them and I'll start with Denise o as a question I'm a republican thank you Denise not a never Trumper but could see myself voting for a damn provided it was not one of the quote free stuff for all candidates like Senators Warren or Sanders however I believe a Republican Senate majority would be an important counterweight to a democratic presidency so can you spend some time talking about how the Senate is looking for 2020 what do you think X I think Denise that the odds are is probably slightly on your side tour Santa Ana lot's going to depend on what happens at the top of the tickets but Republicans don't have a great set up this year 23 and coming Republican seats up only 12 Democrat seats Democrats are excited about the prospects in Colorado or John Hickenlooper just dropped back into the senate race in Arizona where Mark Kelly is running against incoming was appointed Martha McSally both States seem promising for Democrats Susan Collins a big veteran of the Senate now has some problems in Maine a lot of it related to her vote for justice Kavanaugh the speaker of the house there is challenging her Democrats or upbeat about that racing and there are some races in the south of people going to be looking at North Carolina Senator Tillis is up there Democrats have a military Veteran running against him they feel very good about that two seats up in Georgia Senator Perdue running for re-election Senator isakson retired and I think Democrats will feel better about those races of Stacey Abrams Eye who lost narrowly for governor would run she said she won't sew a lot will depend on the candidates who emerge there but Democrats will need I think four seats Doug Jones fine guys center from Alabama one on kind of a fluke it's going to be tough to retain that seat and so for Democrats take control of their probably going to need four seats though it's three or four depending on who wins the presidency for the Senate I but if you lose Alabama right that's the problem to me you can see him getting to 3 and then Alabama then they're back to 2 so the odds are that Republicans will narrowly can control the Senate but if there's a big Democratic year they could lose it all top of the ticket I totally agree tell Mike Dion rights as a Libertarian who regularly split his ticket since 1990 where's the discussion of Bill Welch Joe Walsh in Mark Sanford none of them can win the primary but together they can wound Trump just enough to give gems and added two to three point advantage next year can I well maybe the first of all is a Libertarian what the hell are you doing splitting your ticket your supposed to vote the good old tan stop a Libertarian line but it's a good question looking for Stanford cuz I think he can run on Trump's fiscal irresponsibility the core Republican issue and he's a pal of mine anyway were in a winner-take-all world the Republican primary so highly highly highly unlikely they win but most presidents who have real primary trouble going to lose cuz it's a symptom maybe even more than a cause of trouble they have with the electric that's neon pops up the general election so I'm for the more the merrier run run run Trunks and fit shouldn't serve and good luck marks and what's a good website I put aloe plug form so ask Chris Wright's my question has to do with how we are talking about the black vote it is continuously repeated that bite and has a huge percentage of the black vote but most polls also say that what black voters care about most if someone who can win if someone other than Biden wins Iowa and New Hampshire not unlikely is National Polaris is not exist in the same way as on Staples and all the sudden the national front runner has lost the first two primaries that being Biden doesn't his vote share with black voters diminish that's a really good question I think if you look at the national polling one of the things that makes buying the frontrunners he's getting nearly half the African American vote and I don't think it's just because those voters think he's the guy who can win I think it's because of his relationship with Barack Obama as we mentioned earlier that's why he so Faithfully clings to the Obama Legacy it is more than just a casual commitment especially among older African-American voters but I agree if the if he loses the first two races that that sense that he is the the most likely in the least risky Choice could diminish and so you know they got to be working very hard to win Iowa New Hampshire's going to be tough or you know this thing could unravel on yeah the day Superman can fly you ain't Superman no more for all that affection in the community if he starts losing I think he's toast all right man you just you've run afoul of a correspondent named Sandy who said I just heard Murphy sand hats prattle in a primary battle with Mark McKinnon the truth is if the Dems were better at getting grumpy old white guys they beat Trump I think this diversity thing is a rabbit hole for them she writes that Rachel bitecofer says the opposite the Dems beat Trump the way they'd be Republicans in 2018 turnout among certain Independence in the bay it's not the moderate voters so what what do you say to Sandy and Rachel well first of all in the spirit of our friend Senator Klobuchar I have a very simple answer to this but let me take an hour to explain it the couch know I'm teasing I can't I can't you send people it's hard to be like us tell him to stay on message so why is she has my sympathy now Sandy and by the way I don't make these sexy lips that you're making here Sandy might be a fella too but Sandy makes a good point my argument is that all I hear from the Democratic candidates is a lot of a gold celebrating diversity good sign me up I'm for it but if they trim grumpy white male voters away from Trump they will win this election that's knocking your your opponent over where the strength that sets the offensive move here so I think this constant NeverEnding obsession with talking about diversity is a great way to Run San Francisco up two more points and not change the Electoral College and give us four more years of trump go in Macomb County that have to win it just trim it a point or two and you win Michigan same and Wisconsin other place it's so big strategic difference and I think there's this debate your wealth familiar with inside the Democratic party where do you go I say offense I say trim voters that have given Trump unnaturally high levels of support income down to size based on his record and performance and that's the best way to win the election doesn't mean you don't do the other stuff this strategy is about having a focused offense and that's the argument I'm trying to make a that was a Klobuchar length explanation let me just say that there's there are competing analysis Nate Cohn and others about what Democrats need to do the wind because it is not a national election it is a state-by-state election in those Battleground States the electric looks a little bit different than it does elsewhere and my argument would be that some emphasis should be placed a particularly on white working-class women white non-college educated women who seem to be peeling away from Trump and large numbers if if just a small percentage of them across the bridge and vote for Democrat he is he is in deep trouble and but I do think that if you allow him to run the race along the lines of cultural issues racial issues ideological e divisive issues it makes it harder and so I would go for the biggest and most universal argument against Trump which is we can't take another four years of this migraine headache so here's a bonus question that I have to ask you because it'll allow you to reminisce Scott says Mike can you talk about the journey that you made from the day that you shut down the radio free GOP podcast r i p and how you thought about both Trump and what the GOP would become on that day on that day until now we'll share the journey I made was from the microphone to Mulligan's Bar and I crawled out I was so depressed about Trump winning but my prediction was wrong I said he'd lose so I thought looked shut up give me year maybe just maybe he will be better than we all think of course it was even worse than the log spectations I had so it's good to be back podcast and broadcast in the truth much like we tried to do if radio GOP but this time I got a great partner in crime with the great David actually thank u r mailbag if you have a question don't be shy just email is it hacks on tap at gmail.com send us your mailbag question, an insult
