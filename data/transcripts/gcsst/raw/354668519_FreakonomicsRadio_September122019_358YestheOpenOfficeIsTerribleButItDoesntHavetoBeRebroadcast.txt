either podcast listeners this week we've been in London recording some live shows that you'll be hearing soon and where have you been after a long peaceful summer you have been back in your office so we got a little gift for you one of our favorite episodes from the archive called yes the OpenOffice is terrible but it doesn't have to be hope you enjoy and thanks for holding down the fort while we are out here gallivanting cheershey are you at work right now and do you work in an office we ever work in the office if you have is a good chance it was an open office at least to some degree the open Office design is been around for decades in a variety of forms if you are a cynic he might think an open Office is all about cramming the maximum number of employees in the minimum amount of real estate but you can also imagine that an OpenOffice produces better interaction and more collaboration would it be nice to know if this were true these people wanted to learn I'm Ethan Bernstein I'm an associate professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School my name is Steven turbine I am a recent graduate Harper College and I currently work for a Global Management consultancy turban has since moved on from his consulting job anyway he and Bernstein hadCooperative paper called the impact of the open workspace on human collaboration I don't think I realized how much anger there was against open offices until the research was published and I was contacted by a number of friends and colleagues about their open offices and their deep deep emotional scarring there's certainly a population of people out there who hate I think that's perhaps even not strong enough about where I'm going but proceed please it's just people find it impossible to get work done they find a demoralizing also the lack of privacy in the feeling that they're being watched by other's privacy tends to it give us license to be more experimental to potentially find opportunities for continuous Improvement to avoid distractions that might take us away from the focus we have on our work Ethan is really I would say the king of privacymy research overtime has been about increasingly transparent workplace and its impact on human behavior and therefore performance 5 overtime then ask a question what about the OpenOffice how does it impact the way in which people work in collaborate I haven't had an empirical answer in search of an empirical answer Bernstein and turbine began to study of to Fortune 500 companies that were converting from cubicles to open offices sure the downsides of an OpenOffice are obvious the lack of privacy having to overhear everything your co-workers say but what if the downsides are offset fire Grand flowering of collaboration and communication idea generation what if the Open office is in fact a brilliant concept that we've all been falsely maligning today on Freakonomics radio will hear what this new research has to say to the city had two main conclusions here why it's so hard to design one office that works for everything about half of our time is spent in Focus mode a little over quarter of our time is working with others in person in about 20% as working with others virtually and we ask we all important question what's wrong with just working from home three great enemies that working from home is the fridge the bad in the television from Stitcher and Dubner Productions this is Freakonomics radio the podcast that explores the Hidden Side of Everything here's your host Stephen Dubner the office is such a quintessential emblem of modern society that it may seem it's been around forever but of course it hasn't the economy of the United States is based on farming and it was based on manufacturing and so the office was almost an afterthought that snake kills of all the author of the book called cubed secret history of the workplace and so people that were offices are essentially paperwork factories so we should just sort of array them in an assembly line sort of formation bedroom filled with long rows of desks and Scattered on the periphery private offices for the managers this factory model which got to start in the late 19th century came to be known as the American plan and it was standard office form for decades at least in the US but then in the middle of the 20th century in Germany they were two brothers dish Nella Brothers who began to wonder about the nature of the American Plan there's a sense that this was arbitrary and there was no real reason to lay out an office in this way 1958 Wolfgang and Eberhart chanela created the quick boerner Consulting Group with the idea of bringing some intentionality to Modern office design and one of the ideas that came to that was that an office is not like a factory it's actually a different kind of workplace and requires its own sort of system it so maybe there isn't a reason to have desks in rows maybe there isn't a reason for people to have private offices at all if essentially the office is not about producing things but it's about producing ideas in about producing communication among different people and so over time they pioneered a concept that they called the fuel hole and shaft or office landscape and essentially the first truly open-plan office in office it was more collaborative and more egalitarian it looks extremely chaotic you just have desks in clusters and they didn't seem to be arranged in a pretty haphazard form but in fact there was rigorous planning around in a way that would facilitate communication and the flow of people and ideas and it eventually made its way to England and the United States and it was considered it an incredible breakthrough a breakthrough perhaps but the earliest open office has Drew complaints similar to the ones we hear today lots complaints by not instituting a barrier between people by not having Doors by not having any way of controlling the way sound travel in the office it stopped facilitating the thing it was supposed to facilitate which was communication because it became harder to communicate in an office environment were phones were ringing off the hook where you could hear typewriters across the room and things like that it wasn't actually utopian space that it promised to be in fact it was deeply debilitating and somebody's for the kind of work if you wanted to do meanwhile there was an American named Robert Probst working for the Herman Miller Furniture Company in Michigan he was not himself trained as a designer he was sort of like a freelance thinker Propst was intrigued by the office landscape idea its openness and a Gala Terry and aspirations but you also appreciated its practical shortcomings and he decided to turn to experts to Anthropologist to social psychologists do people of that nature after some research Propst came to the conclusion that individuals are well they're individuals and they need more control over the workspace key and the designer George Nelson came up with a new design in which each office worker would be surrounded by a suite of objects to help them work better in 1964 Herman Miller debuted action office there was a standing desk a regular despistada and a telephone booth design critics loved the action office it looks incredible threes very expensive and very few managers wanted to spend this kind of money on their employees so they went back to the drawing board and they tried to come up with something cheaper 1968 Herman Miller released the action office too and it was the three walls Spacey's fabric wrapped walls that were angled and they were meant to enclose a suite of furniture and it was meant to mitigate the kind of chaos that an open Office plan might otherwise have you may know the action office to buy it's more generic name which is the cubicle Michael promised a variety of advantages it's meant to be very flexible and it can form an impromptu conference room and it was meant to divide up in Open Office plan in a way to mitigate the kind of chaos that an open Office plan or not this landscape might otherwise have and it was incredibly well received it was copied by number Furniture companies and soon it was spreading it offices everywhere but the cubicle could also be exploited you became a perfect tool for cramming more and more workers into lasting Myspace a very cheaply and so did the whole notion of what protest is trying to do what you know dick to give a worker a space that they can control with turn into the exact opposite and it was clear that his concept had become the Maslow symbol of office life indeed the Revolutionary Freedom giving cubicle came to be seen as a sort of corporate version of solitary confinement this left Robert Probst most unhappy and he blamed managers he blames people who know word we're not in vitamins that that created when he called Baron rathole type environments Robert Probst like the Chanel Brothers before him had not quite succeeded in creating a vibrant and efficient OpenOffice their new environments introduced new problems chaos in the first case cubicles in the second as with many problems that we humans try to correct weather in office culture or Society at large the correction turns out to be an overcorrection unintended consequences leap out in Humble us and yet in this case the fact is that most offices today are still open offices why are we holding onto this concept if it makes so many people so unhappy if you're looking truly at a cost per square foot having OpenOffice is is cheaper Steven turbine again and here's Ethan Bernstein again there are a lot of people whether their managers are employees who like the OpenOffice admit that managers are primarily impressed by the cost savings open office but some employees some employees like it because they have visions of it being more vibrant more interactive near that that's fun noisy experiential place they're hoping for once you take down the walls and make everyone able to see each other and there's also been a big push around these collisions that emerging social sciences how do you create these random interactions between people that spark creativity Collision is a term you hear a lot in office design and the design of public spaces generally it's the promise that unplanned encounters can lead to good things between co-workers or neighbors even strangers conversations otherwise when this happened the exchange of ideas unforeseen collaboration now the office is plainly a different sort of space from the Public Square the office is primarily concerned with productivity we'd all like to be happy working in our offices but is it may be worth surrendering a bit of happiness and privacy and so on for the sake of higher productivity after all that's what we're being paid for if you want to have a certain kind of interaction that's deep productive in idea generation or in something that requires us to have lots of portable bandwidth between each other it's nice to have that face-to-face interaction the face of these conversations are so important that's Ben Weber the CEO of an organizational analytics company called humanize what we do is use data about how people interact in clever to work thank you email chat meeting date and I also sensor data about how people interact in the real world and we use that to understand what goes on inside companies humanize has developed sociometric ID badges embedded with sensors to capture these data we have by far the largest a descent on workplace interaction in the world and what do the day to say about face to face Communication in all of our research that is consistently been the most protective factor of almost any organization lockamy can think of performance job satisfaction retention you name it I mean people to hit evolved for millions of years to interact in a face-to-face way what are used to small changes in facial expression in small changes in tone of voice and it's really important in what context where high levels of trust especially as work gets more more complex in the things we build and make together are more complex really having that trust and being able to convey really rich information is critical Bernstein and turbine also believe in the value of face-to-face communication Nuance communication around here is it a proposal I have here is a thought I have about how its last meeting went that is a very rich and Nuance communication and most delicious suggest that they stage communication is much better at that sociologists have suggested for a long time to propane quittie breeds interaction property being colocation being close to one another the clothes for two people are together the more likely they are to interact more likely they are to get married the more likely they are to work together and interaction being we will have a conversation we will actually get some kind of collaboration done between the two of us you can look at slouching shoulders you can see what is their facial expression and Becca is a lot of information that is really hard to convey no matter how good you are emojis and let me tell you I am pretty good at emojis okay so face-to-face communication is important for some purposes and on some dimensions and an open Office is designed to facilitate more face-to-face communication so does it work that was the central question of Bernstein and turbine study so in your study there are two companies that were transitioning to open offices for sale can you reveal the identity of one of those companies I can't in order to do this study we had to agree to a level of confidentiality I will say that we had a choice of sites to study and they chose the two that we thought would be most representative of the kind of work we were interested in which is White Collar work in professional settings Fortune 500 companies can you give us some detailed it helps us Envision the kind of office and what the activities are if you work in a global headquarters amongst a series of functions like HR or Finance or legal for sales or marketing this would describe your work setting and can you describe a for the two companies you studied they moved to open offices what was their configuration beforehand everyone was in cubicles and then they moved to a an open space that basically mimic that just without the cubicle walls those barriers went down until you could you could see if John was sitting next to Sally before and there was a wall between them that you know John could cuz he's out until I could see John and that's that was the big the big difference between the original Andy the office afterwards so tell us about the experiment I want to know all kinds of things like how many people were involved did they opt in or not wear that was a randomized and that have a date or gathered and so on the first said we had 52 participants or second we had hundred participants and we wanted to measure a communication before and after the move we started with the most simple empirical puzzle we could start with which was simply how much interaction takes Place between individuals before and after we wanted to spearly see if this hypothesis of a vibrant OpenOffice were true so before the move and we gave each of the participants isometric badges these are the badges we mentioned earlier from human eyes so they contain several sensors one is a microphone what is an IR sensor to show whether or not they're facing another batch they have an accelerometer to show movement and have a Bluetooth sensor to show location so you can get a data point which looks like John again spoke with Sally for for 25 minutes at 2 p.m. you don't know anything about what the cause of the conversation is the number of previous studies that have used the sociometric batches have shown that we are very aware of them for the first say a few minutes that we have them on and after that we sort of got there there you write that the microphone is only registering that people talk and not recording or monitoring what they say do you think the employees who wore them believe that I mean if I think there is 1% chance that my firm is monitoring or recording what I'm saying I'm quite likely to say less yes well it's actually kind of a funny question to get in this case we really weren't but buckwheat we praise the consent form as strongly as we could to ensure that they understood this was for research purposes and if they hadn't believed that they probably would have opted out what are we to make of the fact that the data represents the people who acted in only because I'm just running this through my head if I were an employee and I'm told that you're some kind of experiment going on with the smart people from Harvard Business School and however much you tell me or don't I Intuit summer I figure out somewhere I guess some and we're moving to an open office and I think a man I hate the OpenOffice and therefore I definitely want to participate in this experiment so that I can sabotage it by behaving exactly the opposite of what I think they want me to behave is that too skeptical or cynical by you sound like one of my reviewer's in the peer-review process it is a valid concern let me tell you what we try to do to alleviate it the first thing I should say is we compared the individuals who opted into wearing the badge and those who did not kill series of demographic be got from EHR systems and we don't see systemic differences there it is always possible when you're doing a social science research that someone makes a guess whether it's active or not about what the study is trying to understand and then takes a personal stand and says you know I'm going to stand for what's right and what's right is cubicles and I would have done that for every day for 2 months so it would have been a remarkable feat of endurance we don't think that's what happened but you know they open Office factions are all real so death reports keep in mind in addition to all these data from the employees badges the researchers could also measure each employees electronic communications their emails and instant messages again they were only measuring this communication not examining the content and so will we be able to do is compare individuals face to face and electronic communication before and after the move from cubicles to Open Spaces in these two environments okay so the Bernstein turbine study looked at to Fortune 500 companies where employees had moved from cuticles to open offices and they measured every input they could about how the employees communication changed face-to-face and electronic communication what do you think happened after the break we'll see if your rate also will their findings really matter if the date is say the OpenOffice is a disaster does that mean it's finally dead

solar system to find his missing father and unravel the mystery that threatens the survival of our planet at Astra in theaters September 20th the fate of humanity depends on one man today we've been hearing about the history of the OpenOffice and a new study by Ethan Bernstein and Stephen turban about whether the OpenOffice indeed produces more interaction and collaboration okay so you've done the study two firms over. Of time with a number of people to measure how their behavior changes generally tell us what you found so the city had two main conclusions we found that when these individuals move from closed cubicles into the open Office interaction decreased face-to-face communication decrease by about 70% in in both of our two studies conversely that communication wasn't entirely lost instead II was all that we found was that communication actually increase virtually so people emailed more I am nor how much of that decrease was compensated by electronic an increase of 20 to 50% of electronic vacation that means more emails YMS and depending how you think about what an email is worth a maybe you could say that they made up for it is an email with five minutes of conversation is a 2 minutes it's a little bit hard to say because an email and it in Iraq may not be comparable in item even if we saw a increase in the amount of recommendation was totally made up for the faceless medication what you probably saw was a loss in riches Communications tonight information is being conveyed I was actually less what can you tell us about how the open space affected productivity and satisfaction I'll come out clean and say we don't have perfect data on performance and we don't have any date on satisfaction we purposely stayed away from Satisfaction we just wanted to look at the interaction of individuals in one of our two studies we have anecdotally some information where the organization felt that actually performance at the client as a result of this move I will say that play if we think about this there are probably lots of context that we can think of where more face-to-face interaction would be useful and lots of context in which we think more face-to-face interaction would not be useful and that's where I'd actually prefer to take the conversation. Productivity that at the very least to date managers of property managers of organizations have not thought about this being a trade-off they've assumed cost and revenue go together that may be true in some subset of environment but in others and that's not going to be true what did the companies in your study do after you presented them with your findings one of them has actually taken a step back from the OpenOffice the other has attempted to make the OpenOffice work by adding more closed spaces to it okay so an empirical study of open offices finds that the primary benefit they're meant to confer more face-to-face communication in the good thing such communication can lead to the Lexi moves in the opposite direction at least in the aggregate to be fair and open Office is bound to be much better for certain tasks than others and more important better for some people than others we're not all the same and some of us I'm told not me but some of us thrive in it potentially chattier office but on balance it would appear that being put out in the open reads most people to close themselves off a bit why you can probably answer that question for yourself but turbine and Bernstein have some thoughts to here's one maybe you don't want to disturb other people so when you're in OpenOffice your voice carries and adding people decide very reasonably to say well you know I I could speak with Tammy who's who's 3des away but I talked to Tammy just dropped Larry and and Catherine and so I will send her a quick message instead or maybe you compensate for the openness of the OpenOffice with behavior that sends a do not disturb signal if everyone can see you you want to signal to everyone that you are a hard worker so you look intense be at your screen maybe you put on headphones to to block the noise guess what when we signal that we also tend to signal and please don't interrupt me from my work which may very well been part of what happened in our studies here and then there's what Ethan Bernstein calls the transparency Paradox so very simply the transparency Paradox is the idea that increasingly transparent open observable workplaces can create less transparent employees for instance let's say you've been really productive all morning now you want to take a break you want to check your fantasy football lineup if you want to look up some recipes for dinner but you don't want everyone in the office especially your boss to see what you're doing so you do it anyway but you're constantly looking over your shoulder in case you need to shut down the fantasy football the recipe tabs that has implications for productivity because we spend time on it we spend energy on it we spent effort on it we tend to believe these days that we get our best work done when we can be alright then take selves very few of us get up on a stage in front of a large audience which is somewhat of how some people in crowd of the OpenOffice and feel we can be our authentic selves so I have an idea that is the Stanford Economist Nicholas Bloom if I in Argo discuss it in my colleague on my manager and then open Office I'm terrified they can other people hear they might pass judgment on my room's can go round loom is studied this realm for years I Walk Alone on firms and productivity so what makes some friends more productive most successful what makes other phones last successful so let me ask you this a recent paper found that a couple of Fortune 500 companies who switched from cubicles to an open Office plan with the hopes of increasing employee collaboration that in fact the openness led to less collaboration so knowing what you know about offices and people does that surprise you know really have collaboration that you have no privacy where is if it's in a slightly more closed environment it's easier to discuss ideas to bounce things around or consider the ultimate closed environment your own home one piece of research I did that connected very much do they open Office was the benefits of working from HUD working from home has a terrible reputation amongst many people you know the nickname shucking from home so I decided to do a scientific study so we got a large online travel agency to Sky division who wanted to walk from home in RI that have them randomize employees by even or odd birthdays into working a home vs working the office now this is a travel agency in in China correct yes it was see trip which is China's largest travel agent is very much like XP deer in the US Open stunningly what came out as one of the biggest driving factors this is just much quieter working from home they complained soften about you know the amount of noise and disruption going on in the office so they're willing to open Office not tell us about you know people's but having boyfriend problems as a k can the fake out rooms in the World Cup soccer sweepstakes and the most amazing was the the women that told us about her cubicle neighbor do to have endless conversations with her mom about her medical problems including a horrible things like an ingrown toenail and some kind of War issue meant what could be more distracting than that so not surprisingly you know in the OpenOffice was devastating for her productivity so you find overall working from home raises what exactly the productivity that happiness so we found working from home raises productivity by 13% which is massive that's almost like an extra day a week so a much more productive in massively more more productive way more than you unprotected and they seemed a lot happier that attrition rates are how frequently they quit hauntedest was that didn't have the commute and all the uncertainty and I didn't have to take sick days off but the other big drivers is just so much quieter a home you also do right though. one of the downsides of working from home was a promotion became less likely yes yes we don't know why but why not just get forgotten about another story that she needs to develop skills of human capital relationship Capital that we need to be in the office to get that to be promoted and then two people walking a hymen nights at I don't want to be promoted because in order to be promoted I need to come in the office most of them to leave me alone the most surprising thing from the secret working from home experiment was off to the end of the nine months see trip was so happy that I was saving about $2,000 per employee working from home cuz they're more productive and they saved in office space so they said I can everyone can I walk from her and we discovered off the people in the experiment about 50% of them had peanut decided to come back into the office and that might seem like an amazing decision because Hayden are choosing to commute for something like 40 minutes each way a day and also sense that are less productive in the office and about half that pay with bonus pay that getting paid less so you know we can't let you know that time and pay was kind of fooling by 10 15% but they were still coming in in the reason I told us it was lonely I have another three great enemies of working from home is the fridge the bed in the television some people can handle that and others, really know till you've tried it so what happens if people try it and some people live in a very productive right they should stick with it and I'll just try and come back into the office the more you learn about the productivity happiness of office workers in different settings the more obvious it is that one key ingredient is often overlooked Choice some employees really might be better off at home others might prefer the cubicle and some might Thrive and an OpenOffice you also have to acknowledge it no one environment will be ideal for every task so if you stop and think about how do we spend our time about half of our time is spent in Focus mode which means we're working alone a little over a quarter of our time is working with others in person in about 20% as working with others virtually that's Janet Pogue McLaren from the global design and Architecture Firm again for I'm one of our Global workplace practice area leaders in the diversity of tasks required of the modern office worker you need the best environment for the task at hand so if you're getting ready to go on to a conference call instead of taking at your desk you may go into a conference room when you finish that you may go back to your desk search up on email you may socialize around a cafe area or even take a walking meeting outside we need to have all these other work settings at our disposal to be able to create a wonderful work experience it doesn't sound so hard does it so how do you create that but start with the basics McLaren acknowledges that many open offices don't address their key shortcoming the biggest complaint that we see in an open offices that don't work is the noise and how do you mitigate noise interruptions and distractions and that can be noise as well as as dishwasher and so being able to design a space that zones the floor and smaller neighborhood that tries to get buffers between noisy activities there's architectural interventions we can also do with ceilings and materials and white noise that may be added to the space and it's not about creating to quiet up environment that can be just as ineffective as a noisy environment you really want to have a a buzz and energy but just not hear every word you also want to account for what Economist call heterogeneous preferences and what normal people call individual choice choice is one of the key drivers of effective work space and we have found that the most Innovative firms actually offered twice as much choice and exercise on that choice then non Innovative firms do and choices really around autonomy about when and where to work it could be as simple as having a choice of being able to do Focus work in the morning or the able to work at home a day or in another work setting in the office to that end no two employees are exactly alike and more important no two companies are like either common mistakes that organizations to as they try to copy someone else's design so if you think it's a cool idea of something that you saw on the west coast let's say it's it's a tech firm and you're not even a tech firm in your sitting here on the east coast and you try to just copy of verbatim it doesn't work it's got to reflect how your organization works and the purpose and brand and community that you're apart of so oftentimes companies would start to adopt what other organizations are doing and say yes that will save us space so let's a doctor but they're missing out by not providing all these other spaces to balance so they want the efficiency without creating all the other work settings that people need in order to be truly productive it's worth noting that Janet Pogue McLaren a principal with a design and Architecture Firm is arguing that the key to a successful office is design in architecture but it's also worth noting her firm's on a great deal of research in all different kinds of offices all different kinds of companies all over the world and several studies in the US and the UK but we've also done Latin America Asia and Middle East somewhere just completing a study in Germany so what's her prognosis for the long maligned open office is not Dad often times people say you know which is better private office or open plan we measured all types of individual work environments and what we found is that if you solve for design noise and access to people and resources they perform equally and one is essentially not better than the other and the best open-plan can be as effective as a private one and that was a surprise I love data when it it tells you something unexpected so do we so do we next time on Freakonomics radio now that we've looked at the office itself how about the least beloved activity that happens in offices bad meetings at just been accepted as a cost of doing business or meetings even necessary we actually have vastly Superior Technologies to do exactly the things that people say go on a meeting people who study meetings I study meetings because I dislike them tremendously from people who tried to fix meetings and my experience most unhealthy peace not on healthy conflict and we'll hear from you or listeners about your best and worst meetings our last meeting ended with our entire Armenian office yelling over each other in Armenian and I'm sitting here thinking like okay everyone is about to quit how to make your meetings list terrible it's next time on Freakonomics radio Freakonomics radio is produced by Stitcher and
