The guy who killed the guys who killed his father he also reminded at his own 12 preservers and sit bag wasn't even the best of the bunch that honor went to one mod Barbie are key because well being a king was far more boring than traveling the world fighting stuff Bob Marley's dad a prince had fallen in love with a common woman the only person who wasn't happy about that was Bob bars father's father to his grandfather's new wife she wanted to get with her stepson because apparently no one can have a healthy relationship ever any stories he refused so naturally she turned him into a bear the Kumon woman named serendipitously enough Vera found the bear and seeing as he became a managed night conceived triplets with him those triplets one on to become Kings big tough Viking warriors such as bar Barbie Archy and they have the gruesome honor of avenging their father I put in a leather sack on the evil stepmothers face tightening the cord and quote dragging her to hell how the cold and Grim North underworld anyway after Sebastian when a frost men it seems like there's a rare opening on team Berserker and bhad bharbie are key was allowed to take that spot and he was quite literally a beserker because it was rumored that he had a spirit bear that followed him around because why not well outfitted with 12 at his back her up for shaping up to be a true force to be reckoned with can you send medication of just how much time has passed since the last episode scold the half-elf baby girl giving a king helgi right before you ran off to be killed was now of marriageable age so about 12 or 13 years of past yeah now what is foretold that a baby will bring anguish to your bloodline you don't necessarily need to fear that person but maybe treat them with a baseline level of respect like maybe don't shame her Viking king husband at his own wedding you know that the most awkward family meetings King Adele's Queen yourself off of scold to King Shore Bard don't worry none of these names will be on the final at the wedding Feast Ralph said that he just had to research a weighted belt here he had a kink your heart is sore to hold refasten this belt and then to get sore back then he and his Berserkers laughed out loud that just happened she was confused as we all will be in the situation what just happened with a smile King cross said that his new brother-in-law new the old adage right whoever holds the sort of a man I'm doing his belt will from then on be the lesser of the two well broth planning to sort of kinky Rivard lesser of the two even told his brother cruise line up the way they had practiced he ran through a tunnel of Hi-5 before circling his way back to the Mead and yeah apparently the stood up because from that day forward begrudgingly paid tribute to King cross it was by Bar number the bear guy who finally said it it was a shame that their King the guy who kept all the Berserkers bloodlust in line and recovered his father's gold yet from Kenya deals looking on the overwhelming force that now occupied us Halls Cross nodded you know what it was time to go Warriors in addition to his 12 beserker Champions and they sale North when they reach Sweden it began to grow cold and seeing a small farm in the distance and the farmer enthusiastically coming out to welcome biking Raiders into his home this load you sure about this it's almost winter and we'll eat like the rest of your food King Croft warned that the farmer and trani brushed it off telling them to get inside the farmer whose hair covered one of his eyes then turned her off with a deluge of compliments what does are you looking good looking cut and ripped like you could I don't know take out a giant wolf that's going to eat the Sun the farmer said before slapping the King on the back going to feed a hundred people like it was nothing that night the farmer conveniently forgot to heat the house and when the Warriors woke up the next morning he told King Prof two things one experienced worse than that with King Adele's into he should send half of his fighting force home because he wouldn't win this war with numbers Bible what did he know he was just an average farmer with shockingly specific knowledge of frost plans and future Alright by now thought about it there was something oh Danny about this guy so we ordered half of us fighting force home suspicions of her all four confirmed at the next stop when the farmer Ronnie came out and told them they could spend the night there as well as don't worry about how we got there faster or why he owned Farms or anyting he waved everyone inside that night having false men got up because they were so thirsty and on this epic Viking version of Willy Wonka's factory tour they were the next have to leave as soon as Frost that they should be getting on the road the worst blizzard that any of them had ever seen cropped up and oh oops prophetess men had to stay another night lights from Ronnie the guy said with a wink with only one I was really more of a blank that night he built a fire in all but four often is 12 Champions ended up on the other side of the room, Ronnie said that if only Croft and a small blunt then there will be some chance that they would return otherwise there was none King Hall thought about it and not sure sure take thanks for the pointers I wouldn't know almost got me, Ronnie said nope he was just someone I farmer with prophetic knowledge and lots of wine even though Odin you know the guy with the washboard abs School Raven friends only trying to make sure the world doesn't end know you couldn't say that he did that guy sounded awesome though easy peasy lemon squeezy still set when he saw that cross fighting force consisted of just himself and 12 guys what's a lemon is a buzzer asked anyway yeah they were here and they already had some requests basically they wanted their horses to be treated with respect seems okay so be advised her approved it feels raised his hand now he wasn't evil King and evil Kings do not treat animals with respect they were to cut off the horses tails and she's there for locks so close that it expose the bone grimacing the advisor took the orders to the Shirley thrilled stable-boy when candles made its way into the throne room he saw none other than spit back his former Berserker standing before off the other Eleven Warriors a dent in the back of the skull and I out of his head a scar on his forehead to blows on the hand that is all you lost fighting for me Adele's boom from the far end of the hall all the fires it took the ones Illuminating his face Sprout and they have been rehearsing this for weeks he didn't wash his understudy did it in the rehearsal yesterday and it looked fantastic super ominous even better cross Vikings wouldn't have any clue that they actually completely dug up the floor at the Great Hall in traps and holes everywhere it was top-notch evil King stuff King Adele's face glowed atop his throne is he heard Frost Champions cry out that it was a trap You're The Clash of swords in the dark and the sound of several bodies at the bottom of the spiky pets and then silence he waved his hand and ordered the Torches lit what does remark when the lights came up in her off and is 12 warriors were standing in the middle of the room surrounded by pit sent what was surely a nightmare for candles health insurance plan guys did you attack our deaths I am so sorry wrong I don't know what got into these guys seriously Adele stop talking ldap and you know where was he told his guys chew Hoffman's boys a good time and what do Vikings love more than fighting it was just a miscommunication while he was trying to save face he was nodding to the guys with a torch yes Plan B that's what the Winking meant one of the deals men put the torch to the floor a million room spinning barricade between king of deals and Croft and the respective Warriors it was actually another Ploy because staying among his Warriors didn't know which one can cross was he figured he wouldn't be as strong as its Champions soaking Adele's had his men keep piling logs and an indoor bonfire just a fantastic idea that King Ralph wouldn't be able to take the heat Adele's of course absolutely couldn't take these and already scooped just throwing back to the outer wall as the clothes a prophet is minburn around them they remember their Oaths back in Denmark not to trim back in the face of iron ore fire this was getting a bit more difficult honor seeing as they're closed but not burned off their bodies as they stood there but to show how tough they were they tossed their own Shields onto the fire the blaze Rising almost to the ceiling can you deals could barely take it when he saw something coming out of the fire Kings Croft Shadow from the other side of the fire that he flees no fire who jumps over it and proceeded to jump over the fire on the other side the singed in naked Vikings toss those were feeding the fire into set fire turned and made their way to King of Deals Deals though came prepared with a plan see he ducked into a hollow tree at at the back of his throne room and by the time I call for this bizarre Chris reached it ping Adele's had magic display on out of there seeing as he had killed her father and her first husband lets the engross trying to help him kill her son was hartsell and king of those didn't give it up to leave her the footsteps of King Croft on the hallway he sneered magic does way out of that room just before the door flew open

of wood and the Queen's quarters cross met her loyal servant bog left the nail re-clothe Viking king calling him as skinny as a pole Croft like this name and decided to go by prof. crocky crocky keeping the word for that type of pole ladder ball join the group has a weird little curiosity he was small I eat not epic Viking size and funny me promise to protect her off with his life and if prof. died Aventuras King cross laughed and with a strong vote of confidence so that there were like twelve other guys better suited for that whole thing might have gotten the ability to make good on his way with right then and there though because behind them the Vikings hurt a thundering through the house and trying to find a troll in the form of a boar so I guess just an angry boar barreling toward them I swept it from baar baar Zacks of crack use heretofore unimagined dog biting the bourse ears off in the Bohr retreated fortunately for him but unfortunately for the people in the house were made it right before the Flames cover the door working his way on down a plan D King Adele's thought that he finally had two Heroes they were trapped in this little well-built house and his men pilot what I'm outside since the last Afro Circus disappeared inside so when you're burning down a house with your greatest enemy inside you should make sure they're not a legendary Warrior because if they are you a pretty much always lose sure that no one could break through those walls and attack them candles enacted plans e through G when he screamed sort of them self and ran for his life into the woods lacrosse and his men did just that and broke through those wooden walls after they got vagan your side of the house more often is Berserkers pursuit of deals and what remained of his men it's the forest unfortunately a marriage was a marriage Adele's was a king in Sweden was powerful needles that called and Warriors from all around the country and the days prior and you'll be bringing in reinforcements you're so gay for office inheritance the best horses in the Swedish capital and most of all ideals is Family ring called Sophia Grace with that she kissed her son on the forehead and told him to go get done what he set out to do yet regain his inheritance and then some listening to his mom off and his men left later on that morning as the Vikings Road South they're waiting ships they sell it first one silhouette on the Hills behind them then 10 than a thousand it was the Swedish army they will be overtaken in a matter of minutes the other pressure cookers turn the fight this will be a good death they would take their place in the halls of Valhalla yeah just like farmer Ronnie wants no guys just keep riding we're good and before the bear guy says anything no it's not retreating check this out king Croft said and did this hand is the Gold Cup filled with gold coins as they rode he sprinkled the hills with gold so that when the swedes passed over and saw the gold they stopped and started fighting among themselves for the treasure candles was almost tearing out his hair they had the Danes it was 12 guys seriously they would get the golden they killed them in that is Family ring remember this is a Norse myth never go for the ring I just got out for it let down from his horse and bent down to pick up the ring and that's when he heard the Laughing it was rough he was nearby and left a messy a bent the back of the greatest of swedes can you dose her this laughter just one moment too late to do anything because in that instant cloth crocky was there is sort skofnung and hand and he was cutting off a Dill's buttocks yeah the super serious biking war ended cartoonishly violently with a Swedish King losing his buttocks down to the bone King of the Hill screaming with the two cheeks just sitting there on the ground he forgot all about the ring feeling faint from lack of blood came back to the line of guys fighting over the gold pieces before passing out the war it seemed was finally over King cross I want a slice off his butt from Ronnie asked s Crofton is berserk has arrived at the third farm that he owned yeah you sliced off his but there's like a 1 in 14 million chance that the guy would walk away without a butt but you found it good job so he has want some weapons call crack you looked at the Rusted and decrepit weapons but seriously use these from a Ronnie said that you should absolutely use these dining battle was one of the surest ways to go to buy you know what nevermind just take the gifts and go getting big fights big scary fight Crawford is brow he saw where this was going he didn't say that loud but he knew Odin's whole scam the guy found the best warriors and gave him favor and when they started to reply in his favor he pulled it away at a critical moment leading to their deaths that way they would join him in Valhalla and fight at Ragnarok prof. shook his head as far as Odin's attempts to kill epic Heroes went this one was just lazy a little insulting to golf push back the rusty weapons and stood from the table saying that he didn't want the weapons and he didn't want from her cronies Hospitality he ordered his Berserkers back to their horses they were riding through night does my body burn the others telling them that angry in the king of the Gods was a bad idea golf kept riding in the night from Ronnie yell that it didn't matter he would get Rolf in the end he always did prolong time things were peaceful in Denmark cutting off the buttocks of the next most powerful King in the region will do that for you no one wanted to risk the ire of a king that could walk into a country with 12 guys and walk out the Victor that is no one except his half-sister the half-elf scold she been forced into a marriage by cross and at her wedding he had shamed her husband for years they've been paying tribute to her off and she was finished with it you never deserved it but now having not done anything in over a decade heinous beserker sparking complacent lazy so I'll force is the message from the sister she asked for a break of sorts the next three years at the end of the three years she was paid for off his tribute one lump sum Ross coppers were overflowing he hadn't had a major war in over 10 years and half of Scandinavia was pain and tribute he left it off of course Culkin ever break juice family after all there would be interest on it though at the end she wasn't getting away from that later on that year kinkier Bard skulls husband came back from the mailbox scold was in the middle of preparations ask him what the matter was with a frown he said that King Ralph didn't invite him to his you'll party again scold rolled her eyes oh that this made what 17 years in a row now 19 QR bar corrected it was the talk of the season is Champions when everyone play games and drink Mead and their Mistresses were invited oh I'm sorry you can't make it honey I'm busy and you know it's a good thing you're not going to be across you'll party really why Scott stop tracing the rooms with your finger on the table because she was summoning elves norns trolls dragons and countless otherworldly creatures to root a crawl physio party really not ringing any bells when they tirelessly plans whole thing for months can you are Bible app no no he was just joking of course you remember but just so he could be sure that she was on the same page could shoot you run through exactly what was plan from start to finish skull ground and began probably away from his capital and trying to put on a good show for his friends Keene is Berserkers will be there when they weren't occupy their Mistresses as your Bard so wistfully mentioned they never talk about that later then they will be occupied by the meat the name of the game was Fain and Crofts you'll party was quite literally legendary Scully been funneling the gold that would have gone into the tribute into making allies with the surrounding countries and kingdoms anyone that's all weakness or anyone that have been wrong by prof. which was basically everyone was welcomed in and they will be camped in the woods they will catch them completely unaware crash the party and end Croft crocky in the shame that had hung over her and her family and that's almost what happened in his buddies were shacked up with their Mistresses one of his bills erker's Kelty got in a bit of a lover's quarrel he was getting on in age and ask his lover if she preferred 180 year old man or to 22 year old men she didn't even hesitate to 22 year old men what kind of question even was that she understood the subtext but really who could blame her for that answer well Chelsea could when he bit off her nose for answering incorrectly putting on his clothes and walk into the cold he saw the campfires glowing in the forest or had come when everyone was pulled from their bed King cross look on his man they had faced worse odds they have been young men and that the favor of the Gods he knows the prophecy from his father concerning the sister he knew that this was it he have lived a good life and he would have a good death he told The Messengers to go out and speak with scold enjoyed bar to tell them that crosses Berserkers would fight but they would only do so after having their last drink together they want to drink to their satisfaction we're going out in their last fight the scold her this she said that her brother and his Warriors wanted to be more drunk when fighting yeah absolutely tell them to take their time what's a long fight at first no one could find by far one of the Berserkers but that was because he was inside at the back of the house sitting there and drinking me while completely unrelated a spirit bear rabbit skulls are me and blocked her from using her magic Sheltie remember the stand-up guy who just bought his girlfriend's nose off very wisely called Bob Baruch hour for staying inside in that instant the bear disappeared bodvar storm outside of course this was a bad idea for many reasons because skull could use her magic again Croft Rocky fought the hardest hit ever fought killing more enemies in mythological creatures that day that he had killed in his entire life up to that point but they just kept coming that's because like the night King skull have the ability to raise the dead and forced them to fight for her so everybody in that fell in the battlefield turn to fight for her I'm like the night King now she didn't wait for some big reveal the moment someone fell she had them pop right back up the intensity with which Hof cracking is Berserkers fought only serve to Tire them out by bar himself down Scott's husband can you cure bar and cut off his head and foot and sliced in the length of a spine he only yond put himself back together and kept fighting it was Madness the army of the Dead begin to close around them on all sides suddenly the army of the dead stopped and a ring around prof. crocky Zurchers 12th for skating in a ring around their King cannot frantically a skull finally stepped onto the battlefield the crowd parted as she walked with the Warriors and their King until she and cure bar stood at the circles Edge going to think that her brother frolf call drop in front of her Army challenging her to single combat and if this was I don't know I hastily written final season of a TV series The Death of skull what Avengers are magic and the dead including her husband would have fallen and the heroes would have been saved but this is Norse mythology and far from exposing yourself and confronting the heroes scold just wanted to watch him die by Barse turn off and run toward her the before he was even close she commanded the army of the Dead to finish raw finished welcome and it did cross Saga said that he fell gloriously and that there was so much Slaughter that words alone are inadequate to describe it I am actually woke up in Valhalla to the Meade flowing from a goat's gutters on the roof and Odin wearing a i-told-you-so smirk the true power in the family was recognized me even though you are far was the king queen scold was the Undisputed ruler of the realm and because we can't have a powerful woman ever in the story it said that she was a terrible ruler and the hare Reign was short-lived then doesn't that little weirdo fog defeated scold her he was that spindly little servant who gave her office nickname it's a brother cut skull dinnerware before she could use her satyr magic and then tortured to death before returning the rules around a frost daughters because yeah he had daughters and no they were mentioned up to this point neither was with for frost Queen was of note the Indian has its Viking cake and eat it too over there was written some 600 years after the events in question in a christianized Denmark just before cross death it says that the only thing that could stand against such darkness is the army of the Dead be the power of God also to back ropes not a Christian and that he's going to die but he died awesomely and a way of Viking would love it seems like the writers of the sagas are kind of
