Jonathan Arden a forensic pathologist who work this case and he made that comment that it doesn't add up here of course we're going to determine that the manner of death was homicide for that comment it doesn't add up to stuck with me because no matter where you land on the manner of death that comment stands true take the word suicide and homicide off the table still something went wrong that day so I want to take some time to share my final thoughts regarding the death of Christian andreacchio and what about that day February 26th that fails to add a let's start back at the beginning we began our Deep dive into this case one of the first things we covered for the Alibis of Dylan and Whitley there's any issues about their Alibis that starts with the fact that their Alibis for that day cannot be confirmed by anyone else and that includes one another yes not even their stories align with one another and that should have been a massive red flag in the early days of receiving more details I just can't seem to make sense of for example The Gunshot residue Willie and Dylan both say they were not around when the shot was fired Dylan says it was the Best Buy Whitley said she was asleep which I will always feels impossible but either way if they weren't around when it happened how did they get the gunshot residue on their hands you make the argument that it was transferred by touching Christians body where the gun while awaiting mpd's arrival and that could totally be the case for the problem is that's not what they said it seems Dylan never even had to explain the presence of GSR on his hands and ask for Whitley I'm sure you haven't forgotten her explanation that it came from shooting guns the night before any expert has spoken with any research I've done on GSR makes it pretty clear that this is not plausible and that's not because she took a shower or wash your hands nothing like that she may have and she may not have it really doesn't matter because that GSR should have worn off strictly based on time and typical usage of the hands on an average day another issue I have is regarding the story that could put a gun to his head in an argument with Willie assuming this actually happen I've two things to point out the first why would Whitley not tell if it worries about this Dylan. It was necessary I'd argue that it was necessary to tell them but if you remember when asked the question by MTD did Christian ever mention hurting himself her response was I don't think so and keep in mind even if the story about putting the gun to his head was fabricated and that's why she was unable to corroborate it there still text messages and Christians phone whether he typed them or not that should have went a different answer than I don't think so which brings me to the second thing I'd like to point out on this topic what Dylan had to say about it when questioned by MPD Dillon state of the Christian had mentioned hurting himself before so he didn't go into any details and of course we know Dylan was the one and the only one to tell the story of Christian putting the gun to his head so maybe it did happen exactly as he told that the prom doesn't really lie there if Dylan is telling the truth about this then the real problem lies with what he did after this first of all he did not alert anyone to Christian threatening to take his own life that was an opportunity to try and protect a friend but okay he failed to do that he did however say that he took the gun from Christian and hit it I commend them for that that was a good move on his part but he stated that when he left to go to BestBuy he gave the gun back to Christian and this is where Jay are intense belief in the crime of culpable negligence comes into play you saw and put a gun to his head he took the gun and hit it then you gave it back and it's not like he gave it back when all parties were present according to his own statement he chose to give the gun back when he plan to leave the apartment I'm all wet he was sleeping which left Christian alone and unsupervised now I'm by no means an expert in criminal law but from my understanding this has to be considered culpable negligence but we're dealing with his Alibis really become problematic is when you consider the sign the sign says a lot in this case and there are many points that could be argued such as an apparent cleaning of the scene and that the gun was found mainly decock and in a position that it should not have been found in gunshot residue should also be considered but that's not what I want to focus on I want to focus on the areas where I feel the science really becomes indisputable rigor mortis and livor mortis which in turn reveal a discrepancy in the body position in the time of death originally reported play thanks simple I'll read directly from dr. Ahrens report he says the photographs from the scene and from the morgue strongly suggest the Christian was in well-developed rigor mortis at the scene the time to develop strong rigor mortis varies the typically requires at least several hours and is consistent with a significantly longer interval on the order of 4 to 12 hours the morgue photographs indicate that he was transported in the body bag and essentially the same position he was found namely bent at the waist and at the knees face down the photos also demonstrate that he had fixed livor Mortis on the back of his right leg especially on the calf which is totally inconsistent with his positioning at the scene in which is right calf is facing up so blood should have drained away from that area by gravity the time for fixation of livor mortis is highly variable but it's on the order of hours he had to have been position with his right calf facing down for some. Of time for liver mortis to appear and then fix on that surface this shows that his body had been moved and it's time of death was much earlier than the 911 call calling into question the account given other people who made that call another thing to consider here is that everything Dr Arden shared came well before the recent accounts given by first the responding EMT who can from the Christian was in well-developed burger and second a woman who lived in a neighboring apartment who stated she heard the gunshot that day around 12:30 p.m. around for hours before Christians death was recorded which is all just further confirmation that Christian had been dead for hours if this doesn't call from or investigating then I don't know whatever will because the me this one is a clear-cut sign of Foul Play going back to their Alibis knowing this information it makes it very difficult to put any sort of trust in their statements and they should have had two and still should have to give an explanation for this and for many more things as it pertains to Christians death I understand they're likely tons and tons of other questions you have so many questions I simply cannot answer with certainty why would Whitley keep possession of Christians phone until asked directly by authorities was Christians Jeep moved how did Christians gun that he kept in a cheap get to the apartment was his gun even the weapon that killed his gun not related in any way or more people involved or do more people at least have knowledge they aren't sharing is a long with the name to consider which includes the former DEA son and I know there are many more questions you can add to this I don't think it's too late to find answers to these questions and that brings me some level of comfort knowing that but I think this is what really makes this case so frustrating knowing that these questions and more could have been answered years ago had this case been handled properly and therefore you can venture to say that they're also could have been closer years ago again Christian andreacchio death is one small piece of this it just so happens to be a peace it's very easy to point to and say something is wrong with this picture but he's not the big picture and he certainly not culpable for the lack of Justice in the lack of closure to this day this is where culpability falls on the various authorities that have been involved in this case what I consider the big picture it starts with MPD who clearly box this investigation MPD was followed by MBI in the AG's office who were given an opportunity to right wrongs but they too failed to find Justice then came the release of Christians case File which is handled terribly adding to everything else they andriaccios have gone through and now you have various public officials to believe the investigation was not handled properly that many things do not add up the Christians body was moved and there's possibly even a cleaning at the scene and you have mpd's Captain JJ Arrington she wants to investigate this case and who has arrest warrants and strongly believe they culpable negligence took place so you have all this and the other da sang the new evidence will be required to reopen the case I just don't get it there was enough evidence in 2017 when they arrest warrants were made MTV's very own says there's enough evidence now there's always been enough evidence so you have all these agencies in public officials who are in positions to Serve and Protect and work on behalf of victims and their families and this was the result I don't really care to single out individuals or layout rights or wrongs the fact is the system has failed the andreacchio is that's the big picture and if you're one of the people who finds the andreacchio is diligence annoying or incessant or even crazy then you're missing the point all they have done is what they felt they had to what they've done for their son is admirable and they don't maintain a tunnel vision that this is only about Christian one thing that has been a driving force of theirs is the thought that this could happen to someone else's child and they don't want another family to go through what they've had to go through so on that note I like to zoom out a little further and talked about the bigger picture cares Ray's brother Chris so you live in Meridian Meridian 46 years yeah it's like it that much well I just don't know anything else I guess I understand what you think about is good place the people here are good people but it is a very cliquish town other friends of mine that lived elsewhere they say I will as however small town is in a very well may be a good place to raise children and it's got good schools but like every small town there's there's people that I'm not going this Sara Lee say run things but have influence over the way things transpire will there be economic sir law or social that part I don't like but all-in-all Marin is a good place you're far away enough from the big city to I mean it takes me 15 minutes to get anywhere I want to go I mean I haven't left the you know and I am this whole situation has not jaded mean to Meridian as much as it is the leadership in the city leadership is weak I don't want to lump everybody into that statement we got good people and our County government and our city government at this point in time I think they're doing all that they can do to try to offset the ones who are not doing what they can do if they did everything they could do with this case no and there's a multitude of reasons why Christian was popular and without popularity he attracted the good and the bad you know. I think Christian was a saint by no means I do not but he was his personality attracted all types of kids and so he had the good and the bad influences I wish that I would have been closer on a day-to-day basis with him to where he would have called and asked if I see me you know that's that's probably my biggest regret is the fact that Chris and I were so much alike and maybe I could have steered him in a different direction would you like to see, over the next year I want peace for my sister I don't have any animosity toward the city of Meridian or MBI I won't write app closure she has struggled a long time of this Aaron Todd both and I've been there every step of the way and I tried to put myself in her shoes cuz I got three sons and I want her to be at peace with whatever happens and probably satisfied just now having to go through everything you you of course to become more politically involved and you start looking around things that I probably never paid attention to how many I think that the buddy system and the when I guess the current what you consider corruption that has been going on for so long in Meridian that it's just it is surprising at how blatant people are with it that they don't even try to really cover it up I mean you look at all the different things audio and video released over the last less a year to 2 years on city government officials and everybody gets outraged for about 24 hours 48 hours and then they move on and nothing's ever done I mean there has been things replaced that people should have been arrested for and just openly acknowledging bribes and payoffs and cover-ups and I mean to know if I really want to die and I think that it has become so normalized and Meridian and Lauderdale County that it's almost like people don't care and I think that people are going to have to start carrying and realizing this isn't normal that it is abnormal for people to be so blatant with criminal behavior and that's going to require a lot of change and thinking of just the everyday Citizen and not be willing to accept that this is the kind of environment that you have to raise your kids in and that you know we should expect more I think that's the problem is we've all become conditioned to accept less since accept the status quo and if it doesn't impact us personally which I'm guilty of this to then you just ignore it because it's not really your problem and I think that we're going to have to be more proactive as a community and realize that it may not be impacting us to but a year from now it maybe now my personal problem and it is impacting me and my family that's what I try to tell people even about the situation with Christian you know if it had can happen to me it can happen to you and it can happen to your kid and we all sit back and say we don't like you in there be in that situation my kid would never do that or my kid would never be socializing with those kind of people my mother always said Never Say Never because you really don't know what's going to happen down the road I do feel like that there is a sense of community and a working together that has come out of this whole situation with Christian Dior the podcast was kind of a trigger for that it made people aware that we would never have been able to reach and I think you have really seen a coming together of the black and white community that has never happened before and I think that's great if nothing else comes of this is that at least we can say that Christians death triggered that I think that it has made people aware that they do need to wake up and make change I'm just afraid that people are going to get discouraged again and they're going to go back into that kind of apathetic mood instead of staying motivated nmd rated for changed I think talking about politics and talkin about change and talking about problems in the community hope and lie and said of just complaining about on behind closed doors than doing nothing about it I think if they seized some reward for that then it's going to trigger more change and more challenging the status quo and more willingness to you know can I step out on a limb and maybe out of their comfort zone and do something because I mean really has gotten people involved in politics that would never have been involved and would not have really been catered because at this point it does not necessarily touch them personally but because of Christian story they realize that any given day it could touch them personally what's hellofresh America's

well above the US average and crime rates that includes murders rapes robberies and much more and when I say well above the average I mean it go look it up check out some of the charts they offer on citydata.com or go to neighborhoodscout will find this description with a crime rate of 45 per 1,000 residents Meridian has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes from the smallest towns to the very largest cities once chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is 1 and 22 width in Mississippi more than 91% of the communities have a lower crime rate than Meridian importantly when you compare Meridian to other communities of similar population than Meridian crime rate is quite a bit higher than average regardless of how Meridian does relatives of all communities in America of all sizes when compared to communities of similar population size it's crime rate per thousand residents stands out as higher than most these are statistics I can't stand to see I've met many residents of Meridian these are good people and what's alarming is when you talk to these people you learn that it's deeper than crime itself it's how crime is being handled in the city the people of Meridian are aware of the issues that plagued their city and they want change they care about one another and even with the current state of things they do their best to take pride in their city that says a lot about the community I think it says a lot about the potential that Meridian has we are awaiting response from district attorney Cassie Coleman but she has made it clear where she stands in a 5-page statement that was released just a few weeks ago to the public the statement contains a timeline of events related to Christians case from February 26th 2014 to current enclosing she states that she has offered to meet with the andriaccios and offer stands and states that the DA's office is ready to receive and review any new evidence and that she will only resubmit to a grand jury if and when new evidence is received we also reached out to district attorney candidate Michael Grace who is Cassie's opponent in the upcoming election I was curious to get his take on things just curious how long have you lived in Meridian I live in a district my whole life you with exception when I went off to college and law school would you mind just giving your overall thoughts on Meridian I think the people of Meridian are very honest hard-working friendly folks and they just want to see their Town prosper and for Crime to go down unfortunately for the past several decades the way that things have operated is in it who you know is probably more important than what you know and who you're connected to seems to carry more weight and I think people are tired of that so system of doing things in they want to see a city and a district in which fairness and Equity is the overall priorities right now one of the most negative things I think that is affect the Meridian is the perception real or not that crime is out of control and that people are not being held accountable for their criminal acts you know there's also the issue of lack of jobs and Meridian Hospital administrators and recruiters are having trouble getting doctors to move to this area because of the perception of a high crime rate so I think if there's a change in our system and then we have results that show that we are moving in the right direction people's optimism those seeds of optimism starting to take rutin and I believe our community will get better truck just assisting to work not only Justice have to be done but it also has to be seen to be done and I think that's one of the reasons there's a cry out in this case is because there's a evident amount of inequities in Injustice has it ever occurred including your releasing the case File. That's not how the average citizen would want to be treated if they were in Christian's family shoes curious to get your thought of what you think went wrong with Christians case in the handling of it will I think the investigation from the beginning was a fiasco you know that kind of set the stage for everything moving forward whenever I'm looking at the case now what I'm doing is looking to see what's the next thing to do if I was to get elected and I disagree with my opponents assertion that new evidence is needed to represent this case to the grand jury I think there's enough evidence there to move forward and secondly I would have had how can you gather evidence if you're not willing to quote open the case at the very least the investigation shows tremendous signs of incompetency on the part of the police department and the possibility that there was an extensive cover-up is still there and I believe the government self needs further investigation I do not believe it's never too late to right wrongs other there is a saying that says justice delayed is Justice denied but I think everything's kind of a lot of itself now for this case to finally have some closure and for the people involves to be held accountable I believe that the case should be presented to the grand jury while also continuing to investigate and what's a wrestler made I think you're going to see some traction as far as getting down to the truth of what happened to Christian andreacchio so to confirm you believe that the case should be reopened absolutely I think the case should be open regardless of the outcome of this District Attorney's race if I was to win the race though I believe the tools and the information that has been thus far gathered is enough to move forward when your victim in the criminal justice system or a family member victim sometimes feel like systems working against you one of my promises is to be one of the most fierce and strong advocates for victims and victims families is ever been in that office and make sure their voice is heard Wells about the 15 my little stepbrother who's 11 at the time came home and his name is Corey Corey was adopted and he has fetal alcohol syndrome the core came home and told us that a relative had molested him my folks called law enforcement and an investigation investigation took place and the perpetrator took a polygraph and investigator told my family that he had passed it my folks were not satisfied with that because of the red tape the experience is trying to get the best of getting started in the first place so they went to the Attorney General's office and is there they found out that local law enforcement should have contact the Attorney General's office in the first place because my stepbrother was classified as a vulnerable person because of his mental condition so the AG's office gets involved and they didn't tell my folks that the perpetrator actually failed a polygraph test so they could confirm the Lord for some headlights my family to protect someone who was allegedly molesting 11 year old little boy that's mentally challenged it's just unimaginable will Bilbo ends up taking a case it's presented to the grand jury two counts of lustful touching of a child and what kind of sexual assault are returned and right on the eve of trial the District Attorney's Office dismisses it pretrial diversion so the guy who molested my little brother it's free to go work in a school drive a school bus excetera he was not held accountable for what he did and if you were to ask my family today based off that experience what would they do if I had it to do all over again they wouldn't contact law enforcement that's not the way the system is supposed to work if somebody does you wrong with someone does your child wrong the system is supposed to courage you to contact authorities and let it be dealt with appropriately not encourage vigilante justice not encourage you to take loyal to your own hands that's more saddle harm happens that way and then you know that's one of the impetus is for me decided to go to law school and that was one of the reasons I decided to run for district attorney our system is not doing right I absolutely believe Department of Justice needs to get involved and just take a look at that only Christian andreacchio case but also the city of meridian's administration is a hole you've heard me talk all about Ring the company behind those video doorbells and security cameras but did you know they have an app to help you stay informed about Crime & Safety events in your neighborhood it's completely free and it's the neighbors app by ring with neighbors you receive real time Crime & Safety alerts from your neighbor's it's like a new neighborhood watch in a nap and anyone can join you don't even have to own a ring device it's really simple I just downloaded the neighbours at set my home base and neighborhood and I was it I started seeing Alice from my neighbors immediately and speaking of alerts I see quite a few pop up any given week they're certainly more crime and suspicious activity in my neighborhood and I thought there was but now with the neighbors app I'm aware of what's going on I feel much safer being in the know hear some of the alerts have received this week a video of a man clearly trying to break into a vehicle in someone's driveway another alert that came shortly after was titled my wife's car was broken into and in the comments section neighbors are trying to determine if it's the same guy from the other alert and the scariest alert of the week a video of a man attempting to open someone's front door in the middle of the night look this app has design for your safety and it takes just a few minutes to set it up just go and do it I promise you'll be glad you did if you want to see what's going on in your neighborhood download the free neighbors app today go to ring.com cooper cooper to download from the Apple or Android App Stores that's ring.com / Cooper make your neighborhood safer today with the neighbors app by ring yo it's interesting to think that this was meant to be an investigation into the death of one man Christian andreacchio and now look where we are I never imagined to turning into this but this is where it needs to go when every person you asked about Christian ends up talking about a case similar to Christians or the history of crime and Meridian weather drug trafficking or sex trafficking list goes on or someone they know family or friends to the system has failed where they start telling you who has ties to who or who has dirt on who or who you can't trust or how some public official made a crime disappear and how other officials are spreading dirt on one another trying to expose crime Weatherby bribery corruption or something else then this is where things need to go this means you have problems much bigger than Christians case and maybe if the city of Meridian can get the attention it deserves then Christian intern can get the attention he deserves so rather than are out all the dirty laundry that's been shared with us over the last year we're going to approach this a different way this is a letter to the US Department of Justice to whom it may concern in order to restore public trust and assure the citizens of Mississippi that both our local and state law enforcement indeed do their due diligence to Serve and Protect citizens from harm and Injustice we implore you to consider opening a criminal investigation into the city of Meridian including the Meridian Police Department and any current or former city officials the city of Meridian is under a national Spotlight do Dora podcast culpable which covers the death of 21 year old Christian andreacchio his death was ruled a suicide after a 45-minute vestigation when all signs pointed to file play we have reason to believe the corruption has played a role in the lack of Justice in this case but that's not what we are writing you about why we would love the opportunity to discuss persons case with you we are writing you because we learned through our experience working this case that they're much bigger issues and other major crime that the city is facing because of the national attention of this podcast many locals have reached out to us and the Christians family with personal experiences and information exposing very serious crimes such as sex trafficking and drug trafficking we've also received information supporting the crime of corruption amongst local law enforcement and City officials the citizens of Meridian Mississippi are need of your help to hold their officials accountable for any crimes they've committed in to ensure that the people that hold positions of power can maintain the responsibility to Serve and Protect the citizens of Meridian due to the position some of these individuals hold in Mississippi government and law enforcement we are asking for an outside and independent investigation focused on determining what criminal activity is taking place in Meridian Mississippi we have compiled some information that we believe could be of some assistance if you have any interest please let us know we be more than happy to share feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns you may have thank you for your consideration sincerely Black Mountain media and Tenderfoot TV many of you have reached out to us asking how you can help here's how you can help take some time to write your own letter to the

Org reconsign her petition we spent a good portion of this episode discussing the big and the bigger pictures while that's certainly important so is Christian so I'd like to zoom back in on Christian for a minute and Industry where we started at Sylvia Cartwright said we often pause so much energy into the big picture we forget the pixels as distracting as everything else can make this the story is always been about Christian back in August of 2018 I sat down with the andriaccio's for the first time I had spoken with Ray over the phone a few times leading up so I had an idea of what to expect I was expecting to hear about Christian who he was what happened to him his death how was being the suicide why they believe he was murdered and all the evidence that supports their belief what I did not expect was for this to become what it has become and I mean that in a lot of ways but I won't go into that I was going to meet with them to begin the creation of the podcast the andreacchio swear the first official recording but I want to make something clear I didn't get involved in this just to make a podcast culpable was created to bring attention and awareness to a case and also a city that needs it and I hope was and still is to make a difference and to find Justice for Christian enclosure for the Antioch is andriaccios the night includes you Christian are like family so while this is our season finale do not take the word finale to literally our work is far from over we will continue investigating this and if there's new evidence or breaking the case we will make it known when I going away we will remain dedicated to this until there is Justice and closure and with that said I'd like to make an announcement it's our understanding from comments made by public officials that new evidence could result in the reopening of this case and we would like to help them get whatever it is they need so we the producers of culpable Black Mountain media and Tenderfoot TV are offering a reward of up to $100,000 for new information or evidence that leads to an arrest and conviction you can see terms on our website at Coble podcast.
