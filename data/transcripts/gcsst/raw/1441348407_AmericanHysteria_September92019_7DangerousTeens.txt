on this season will be exploring our bizarre beliefs unfounded fears and Fantastical thinking how they shape our psychology and culture and how much of our past we can find in the present I'm your host Chelsea Weber Smith and this is American hysteria for students that named itself the trench coat Mafia experts call them super Predators gives it won't still alive gabs now rape and Murder By the Year 2005 we may very well have a bloodbath of teenage violenceI thought this episode like all of them really was going to be pretty straightforward something I know you've heard me say before I thought I'd explore the fears of various countercultures that little headlines over the years the greasers in the hippies the punks in the metalheads and finally bring it all around to our newest biggest Teenage felons I thought I do a simple debunking of school shooting deaths around violent video games mental illness and bullying and then make a call for the better gun control that I've long hoped for but the more I read the more I found there was a side all of this that was discussed when they was having a much more devastating impact on our youth than the mass shootings we've come to know so intimately through the media I decided enough people were tackling all the Myriad of myths I just mentioned so I wanted to do something different even though this is an emotionally-charged topic I need you to follow me down a different patha different part of this conversation one we're not having enough running alongside the panics in the eighties and nineties about murderous teenage metalheads that we covered in our season 1 series on satanic Panic other kinds of Panax to emerging out of Reagan Wars on drugs and crime as the Central Park five stood trial for the rape and beating of a white jogger Reagan's fictitious crack babies were growing toward their own teen dumb painted is wildin super Predators committing random and senseless violence in groups of 30 or more forming a tidal wave of violent criminals predicted to eventually be in the hundreds of thousands at the very end of the satanic Panic the first highly-publicized school shooting ushered in the new archetype of the dangerous teen the trench coated Goths sitting angry and dejected on the outskirts of each School lunchroom Hypnotize by the gore video games the fog of mental illness the Revenge of a bullied Soul or even the guns that they were too easily able to access just to get this out of the way early despite how these last few years have made it seem despite how these last few years have felt schools are still statistically the safest place our kids and teenagers can be by far and our youth are still far more likely to be struck by lightning twice then to be killed by a school shooter it doesn't make these extremely rare tragedies any less tragic or any less were the conversation on how to say them from happening but more and more are public schools are referred to as actual War zones by Democrats and Republicans alike the news is saturated with these images of police storming schools of bleary-eyed kids with strange manifestos of parents crying and stunned dizzy with grief not even able to process what happened before cameras put in their face we use these moments as metaphors as symbols for our political opinions which isn't always a bad thing that is one results that come from or helpful even more harmful than that which we seek to address in the case of our Collective reaction to school mass shootings unfortunately the latter is true no matter who we are no matter how well-meaning when we are burning in our Collective rage in our Collective fear we sometimes miss important things and sometimes important people can use these commence to pass laws that we don't even notice it's vital that we take a look at the results of our emotionally-driven social movements are they what we hoped for When We Fear the extremely rare Mass violence of suburban American teenagers who are the invisible victims of our Collective outrage I'm right over the horizon and Sons were studied say the worst is yet to come since the emergence of the concept of the teenager in the 1920s something we talked about more extensively and episode on teenage sex the media has been obsessed with the immorality and danger that these popular subcultures apparently produce these so-called youth Quakes really began when young women cut their hair short and started wearing short dresses when newspapers and politicians were aghast at white teens and jazz clubs mingling a new Urban centers smoking marijuana with young black additions getting more than a little too close their parents believed eventually came the hippies the first serious anti-war generation that terrified parents who came of age in the Conformity obsessed 1950s with all of their drug use and sex with their General deviance with their peaceful Rebellion against ingrained Norms of racial separation sobriety and Christian charity this group that was actively working against the war violence and racism that much of their parents generation embraced work turned into blood hungry beasts when the story of Charles Manson and his Spirit cold of teenage hippies exploded in the news and slowly the evil hippie became an archetype to the permissive 1970s with the movements in favor of women's rights abortion black rights and gay rights as well as the Aftershock of the Manson Murders in the growing cultural interest in Anton LaVey is tongue cheek Church of Satan the Christian right begin demonizing teenagers who'd fled to senseless murder in the name of their Auntie God running concurrent to these panics about teenage satanic murderers were panics about gangs of roving black teenagers who attacked in a white people just for fun these categories contained teenage deviance either deviant for being anti-christian or deviant for being black but as we'll see there are huge differences in how these panics affected the communities that were said to be dangerous capping off the 90s fear of Satanism was one of the most Seminole events that would lead to a new Narrative of the dangerous teenager one that still fills our news feeds today let's start with this event that most of us probably remember one that would go on to change everything we believe about the potential for teenage violence about the safety of Suburbia sparkling outside the inner city a mecca for the innocence of children destroyed for goodbye to vicious young man over the gunshots Bomb Blast hundreds of students ran for their lives Stockton their own school by two of their own classmate who went on a rampage Witnesses say they laughed as they fired their weapons executing their classmates who beg for their lives it's the spring of 1999 Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold walked casually onto the campus of Columbine High School in a quiet Denver suburb carrying large duffel bag the bags contain homemade bombs that the boys had built to blow up the cafeteria to kill hundreds of students they also leave two bombs inside their cars in the parking lot planning to detonate them to kill anyone fleeing from the school as well as First Responders none of these bombs successfully detonate so they revert to plan B going to 9 millimeter pistols and two 12 gauge shotguns from their bags dressed in Long Black trench coats they walk the halls of Columbine quartering a group their peers in the stacks of a library shooting and killing 12 students and one teacher before committing suicide themselves in the two-decade long vein of Satanic ritual sensationalism The Denver Post immediately and hastily reported quote by several accounts the group was interested in the occult mutilation and shock rocker Marilyn Manson and Adolf Hitler the weird part is none of this is true except for the part about Hitler The Washington Post however had this to say the shooters who turn Columbine High School into an unspeakable landscape of Carnage yesterday or members of a small Clique of outcasts who wore black trench coats and spent their entire adolescence deep inside the morose subculture of Gothic fantasy their fellow students said suddenly the archetype of the Teen Satanist transition into a more miles and less obvious threat The Goth like a metalheads of the 1980s The Goth clicks of the 1990s like to portray a dark and often witchy satanic Vibe embracing the fashion of a cartoonish kind of Underworld but these Nightmare Before Christmas obsessed sad kids were not dangerous and the Columbine shooters actually had nothing to do with the group that came to be known as the trench coat mafia they were just a group of Innocence soakers that didn't really know the killers at all but because Harris and Klebold happened to Don those black trench coats Scott's for a Time became the number one fear in America and Marilyn Manson became of course they're hypnotic satanic leader in reality Harris and Klebold were pretty much straight-up white supremacist the Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh and according to their journals his attack was the inspiration for Columbine originally planned for the same day April 19th instead of April 20th when they found a large group of boys hiding under a lunch table they pulled out Isaiah Scholl's calling him the very worst of anti black slurs and then shooting under the table with Klebold reportedly saying and I'm sorry but this feels important quote I didn't know black brains could fly that far this narrative was barely touched on by the media and never explored in a mainstream contacts however the god story has stuck even now so has the story of their outcasted social even though they were not chronically bullied anymore than other students and we're actually relatively popular in fact they are often referred to as bullies themselves by students who were interviewed and the spider characterization of these white boys is evil they too were cast as victims of corrupting influences not wholly responsible for their own actions but rather the product of their ever darkening surroundings of the moral failings of a new America other teens however were not afforded the same privilege more after this you might have heard me talk about this sponsor before they're called native deodorant and natural deodorant company that means you don't have to sacrifice on odor or wetness protection in order to know everything that's in your deodorant the other great thing about Native is it comes in a wide variety of enticing sense for both men and women or everyone in between plus they release new and limited edition seasonal scents throughout the year so their classic sense include coconut and vanilla which is the most popular lavender and Rose which is the one I got cucumber and mint which I'm hoping they might send me another sample of eucalyptus and mint a lot of times I'm sure a lot of you out there no natural deodorants don't work but this one not only made me smell good but it kept me smelling good all day which is something I need is I live in the basement of American hysteria every day sweating profusely which is partially true right now you can

Calm and using promo code IAH during checkout and now back to the show I want to try to call a group of 30 to 40 male pinstripe a 1989 exactly 10 years before the Columbine massacre a twenty-eight-year-old jogger named Trisha meili was brutally assaulted and raped in New York Central Park The Assault was so sudden and violent the Tricia could not remember her attacker or attackers soon the police in the news began reporting that a group of 30 Black and Latino boys between the ages of 14 and 16 we're participating in something called wildin with the New York Post calling them quote packs of bloodthirsty teens from the tenements bursting with boredom and rage roaming the streets getting checks from an evening of ultra violence they were also called Savage they were called the Wolfpack they were called animals and Farrell that night including throwing rocks at cars and even beating up a homeless man but his DNA with later confirm not sexually assault Tricia that night at that time New York businessman Donald Trump claimed that his city was being quote ruled by the law of the streets as a roving bands of wild criminals roam our neighborhoods dispensing their own vicious brand of Twisted hatred on whomever they encounter Trump took out a full-page ad in for New York City Newspapers with the headline and all caps bring back the death penalty bring back our police the boys confessed to the murder after hours of interrogation without a parent or lawyer present for somewhere between 14 and 30 hours are told the media that they were bullied into confessing but none the less they were convicted and sentenced to 5 to 15 years either in a juvenile detention center or in prison depending on their age despite the fact that the DNA found at the scene matched none of those convicted it wasn't until 2001 that the Central Park five would finally be exonerated when a serial rapist came forward in prison to confess to the crime is DNA matched Tom Brokaw describe the Pastime of Wilding as quote rampaging in wolf packs and attacking people just for the fun of it New York Post columnist Pete Hamill stated quote they were coming downtown from a world of crack welfare guns knives indifference and ignorance and driven by a collective Fury brimming with a Rippling energies of Youth they only had one goal to smash hurt Rob stop rape unsurprisingly wildin was not a trend as the media police and politicians claimed that night in Central Park was a single story that was that used to characterize black youth as a faceless violent Bob Collins Pat Buchanan Road quote if the eldest of that wolf pack or tried convicted and hanged and Central Park by June 1st and the 13 and 14 year olds were stripped horse Whip and sent to prison Park might soon be safe again for women this statement is so steeped in Antebellum racism as to be almost cartoonish and it's a fence despite the eventual exonerations of Antron McCray Kevin Richardson Yusef salaam Raymond Santana and Corey wise the damage had already been done The Narrative of black and brown team riots hunting white women and anyone else in a terrible path continue to Bremen the news after the story had sunk into America's Consciousness the early 90s brought reports about something called The Knockout game the urban legend of Wilding had morphed into a new story of black game of punching people in the back of the head for fun especially old white women and then running away the concept was popularized by a man named Paul what was later proven to be a robbery not as he claimed a racist attack on an innocent white man Lane wrote of the incident quote I'm a liberal Obama supporter but that didn't stop the violence on me I have serious concussion issues and my trust for young African-American men in particular is now less than zero he continued to say the black assaults on non-blacks isn't racist is a blatant lie black predators are racist to the Bone most all live the part in prison I assume that mr. laid would not have made these sweeping statements about young white men The Knockout game was everywhere The Today Show for instance reported in 2013 that quote teenagers are knocking people out for the fun of it targeting women and children with cases piling up but none of the incidents cited by the news were actually part of they're off and robberies or personal attacks run-of-the-mill crimes taken out of context with videos clipped to support the desire frightening narrative much of the footage was stock videos of crimes that appear to be random violence but weren't a sociologist named Mike searched extensively to find one legitimate case of the game but was unable to find a single instance and yet the same stories have lasted up to the present decade we talked about the now-defunct concept of crack babies and our season 1 episode called drugs black children born to people who use crack cocaine in the 1980s and the fears they would grow into wildly violent adolescents in the 1990s these imaginary crack babies were slowly growing toward their teenage years and the term super Predator Rose to common use when first lady Hillary Clinton spoke at a rally in 19 86 to the very white State of New Hampshire to take these people on they are often connected to big drug cartels they are not just gangs of kids anymore they are often the kinds of kids that are called super Predator has no conscience no empathy we can talk about why they ended up that way but first we have to bring them to heel and the president is asked the FBI to launch a very concerted effort against gangs everywhere in case it's not clear Clinton means he'll the way you would command a dog to subservience not heal as in to make healthy again this term super Predator was created when conservative political scientist John delillo Cobble together a theory of black teenage violence to come predicting that by 2010 there would be a huge increase in super predators 270,000 of them in fact he called them quote Beckley impulsive brutally remorseless Elementary School youngsters who guns instead of lunches and quote have absolutely no respect for human life to deliver there was no cure for this monster s personality except of course excluding them from schools and then incarcerating them for as long as possible that's what he said that was his plan at the same time the Clinton Administration signed off on the three strikes law that would contribute to mass incarceration at the fastest rate the nation had ever seen and States all over passed laws to try teenagers as young as 13 or 14 as adults even though youth crime was a historically low levels his violent crime control and Law Enforcement Act also drastically increased Federal funding for school police known as school resource officers for sros in addition the zero tolerance policy which first started at the gun-free schools act would soon apply extremely harsh penalties for offenses like a possession of drugs alcohol tobacco fighting dress code violations truancy tardiness and disrupting class very Broad and fractions that could be interpreted at the will of teachers and sros along with the new funding came or surveillance equipment like metal detectors and cameras the zero tolerance laws allowed for a kind of free-for-all and what's considered teenage criminal Behavior with faculty and sros suspending an arresting kids as young as five for things like using a cell phone in class or talking back to a teacher surprisingly a 2011 study found that the presence of sros increased arrest in public schools especially for minor offenses than in the past would have been handled by those in the administration inside the walls of public schools there became a different kind of justice system where the legal rights of students were severely limited with sros allowed to search students and their property without a warrant and even without reasonable probable cause ability to issue random drug tests but never fear Safford United school district number 1 V reading did play some restrictions on schools by determining that strip searches were too intrusive for students there's always been a relationship between race and school resource officers they were first placed in schools during integration during the Jim Crow era of the 1960s in 1967 the Orangeburg Massacre saw police fire on students at a North Carolina campus who are protesting the segregation of a local bowling alley three black teenagers were killed and more than 30 were injured that same year 3500 Philadelphia public high school students walk out of class to March to the Board of Education building such as more black teachers and black history courses 100 riot gear clad police officers beat hundreds of students and 22 people were seriously injured with 57 students arrested instead of these incidents shining a light on policing and racism laws were passed to ramp up the control over these dangerous teens legislation was proposed to prohibit obnoxious behavior in public schools in order to quote keep outside agitators off-campus the Bill's sponsor said you would think that since the 1990s as our attention has shifted to the deranged violence of the white social outcast we would see a rise in the arrest of white male Youth and yet this is not the case instead the rate at which black students entering the criminal justice system has actually risen in 2001 black kids were 4.1 times more likely to enter the criminal justice system than white kids but by 2015 they were five times more likely despite the fact that data has consistently shown that black and white youth commit crimes at the same in urban areas 57% of Schools employee at least one SRO compared to 45% in Suburban districts in 2015 the Department of Justice found that 44% of incarcerated youth were black despite the fact that they only make up 14% of the population and it's not only kids of color that are disproportionately affected a 2011 study done by the ACLU found that students with disabilities are four times more likely to be suspended than those without disabilities in one example from 2015 on 11 year old boy with autism spectrum disorder in Virginia a trash can and was subsequently slam To The Ground by an SRO handcuffed and charged with felony assault on a police officer students who fall under the LGBT category also face higher levels of suspension in a rest another recent incident that gained media attention that you might remember it in South Carolina when an SRO it Spring Valley High School slammed a black girl over her desk by the throat and then dragged her across the floor because she would not stand up to be arrested for using her cell phone in class despite the fact that there was video evidence both the injured student and a girl who film the attack were charged with crimes while the school resource officer was not we was all do more to recognize and look for the early warning signals that deeply troubled young people send often before they explode into violence surely more of them can be saved and more innocent victims and tragedies can be avoided is roughly one in 614 million that's a chance of 0.000001 percent teenagers are far far more likely to die in car accidents far more likely even to die in plane crashes to die by a bee stings to die in a fireworks accident to die by lightning despite how it feels and I understand why it feels that way in imminent and constant danger when they are at school in fact it is statistically the very safest place a teenager can be much much safer than even their own homes and yet these car crashes in bee stings do not usually come with a face nor do they come with a story today on both the left and we desperately seek to explain the actions of white School shooters prodding for exactly what made him do it what in part of the violence to him he was a victim to we say a victim of bullying a victim of mental illness of the cruel assault a video games handed down by heartless entertainment corporations even a victim of the easy which Americans can get guns we want to address whatever it is that made him do it whatever hypnotic force that took first his own innocence away but this same courtesy this search for an explanation was not extended to black youth when Hillary Clinton said we can talk about why they ended up that way but first we have to bring them to heel or As Trump wants said bring back the death penalty bring back our police we asked what did Trayvon Martin do from inside his hood that led to his own death we argue to this day about what teenager Michael Brown did someone who was painted almost like our modern super-predator what actions did he take and was it enough to justify what happened next unlike the satanic metal heads before them as well as the gothic Columbine shooters the behaviors of these 90s era wildin black teens or not why we blamed on the new genre of violent hip hop or Tupac nor the NWA became their hypnotic Marilyn Manson's when I think of the rumors of super predators of wilding in the knockout game didn't seem at all interested in figuring out what made these kids violent mental illness was never brought up bullying was never brought up as well as their access to weapons they just weren't discussed in a very real issue of the increasing poverty rate created by the Reagan administration's economic policies and his racist War on Drugs the only thing that was blamed for these sociopathic super Predators if anything were there crack addicted single parents in their absent fathers this was common and expected violence this was an inherited condition the nature of the inner city itself and the nature of those who grew up inside of it with all this continued sacrifice in the name of school safety you would hope that there would be positive results there aren't those studies do disagree on whether the presence of sros actually leads to a decrease in crime the majority have found that it doesn't though it is difficult to establish whether these results are causal or not but on the topic of school shootings of 68 schools that experience them almost none of them were helped by the presence of their sros four out of the five most devastating school shootings in American history had an SRO present but none of them were able to stop the shooter in the case of Columbine most all of what we have left in our Collective memories is the narrative that America wanted to keep and it's completely incorrect they weren't social outcasts they weren't Goths or their satanic predecessors exceptionally bully and they were obsessed with Marilyn Manson they weren't victims of these corrupting forces they weren't victims of the violence of the Doom video game but they were bald faced racists who wanted to follow in the footsteps of their hero Timothy a story we've never really heard and I'm not saying that Columbine was wholly inspired by some kind of racist agenda but there's evidence that at least a part of it was influenced by that type of thinking I don't know what made the Columbine shooters I don't know what makes anyone a school shooter and I think none of us really do but I can't help but notice the way we continuously sanitize parts of the history of Columbine for example how these boys were able to utter a sentence about black brains without it ever being talked about in the press and yet to this day we believe they were part of the trench coat Mafia but none of the trench coat Mafia were arrested for their taste in clothing of which the same cannot be said for the black teenagers actually arrested for wearing their hair naturally for sagging their pants for talking back with all our talk of War zones in constant danger it's not those who look like Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold those who look like Nicolas Cruz those who look like Adam Lanza that suffer I too want comprehensive gun control it's the fastest way to address the issue of school shootings but when we don't keep in mind how rare these school shootings actually are in the mist of our Collective outrage over any number of causes any number of reasons we forget about the invisible victims that are made Studies have consistently shown that suspending and incarcerated youth affects every aspect of their future from whether they will graduate to whether they'll be able to attend college find a job and even find stable housing even a single arrest can double the chances that a student will drop out of high school and if they appear in court that number quadruples this is known to sociologist and activist as school-to-prison Pipeline and the fear and subsequent criminalization of are teenagers damages the prosperity of our future generation especially those who've already been disenfranchised enough and not only that but if we must talk about government spending in this issue detaining just one youth offender comes in an average of almost $150,000 a year as research around school violence continues to prove it isn't policing the keeps teenagers in line it's actually a strong sense of a caring Community the increasing of security measures have not made Student safer in fact a New York chief judge named Judith Kay and her assigned task force actually found that students reported feeling safer and districts that approach discipline with counseling and mentorship and without a police presence however their parents felt a stronger sense of safety and districts where police officer was stationed in each school but more and more programs such as social and emotional learning and positive behavioral interventions and supports are attempting to engender trust and Care within School communities between authority figures and the children and teenagers they serve it seems that both sides of this debate whatever they blame for the actions of School shooters believe that we need to stop these events before they happen and of course we do but doing so with school resource officers simply doesn't work and it's a waste of precious resources that could be used in more comprehensive counseling and mentorship programs and professionals that can better understand early problematic behavior and address it in a healthy way tactics that have not only been shown to perform better statistically but also help School communities feel safer as a hole without criminalizing those who disrupt whatever official decide in the moment that means in the most recent election cycle Hillary Clinton apologized and express regret for popularizing the idea of the super-predator but her words still resonate with me in a way that she didn't mean them to she said we must bring them to heel the way we would a disobedient dog but all that separates that sentence from a true path toward the safety and success of our teenagers both those deemed as dangerous and those deemed as not is a single letter a sentiment hope we can all matter where we fall in the debate agree with we have to focus on the needs of our teenagers on the needs of all our teenagers it's time to stop criminalizing our kids and instead I think we must bring them to heel from Skylark this was American hysteria next time on the show for Aftershock episode coming next week I will cover violent video games as promised and after that we're covering a really interesting topic called pornography I know all you deviance out there are interested in that American hysteria is written produced and hosted by me Chelsea Weber Smith
