I can't believe Google has no way to like track where that was purchased her for you probably just bought it a drugstore can I guess they'll stand it I mean but wow $500 I just can't believe that you went that far do cuz I think if I found it I think Finders Keepers I mean a credit card that this would have like it's a gift card it's a thing I don't know once you start getting into the right garage like $12 is a lot what Google Play is likely to happen I was going to buying apps on it or something what are they doing money would make me anxious Lee guilty to take it I want to feel some way to like donate some chunk of it and like bite by all means you found it and you tried to find the right person you should buy yourself some some kind of plague if I want if there's some way to donate a chunk of it somewhere because you know what I'm going to imagine though is because it has to be on his account now it's going to be hard and I know what I'll say I'll say this the world works in mysterious ways and maybe you were gifted this because you are a good human being you went and tried to give it up maybe you should just accept it and feel guilt free I mean do you like yes in the grand scheme of things which I get a digital money and it's of something that you can't even really figure out it's like not to close store that you only can buy his digital files and games and apps that they give it to what somebody was new food needs that like someone needs like the last copy of detective Pikachu I can actually own anyway keto just maybe just open your heart and if you see somebody you know I don't know but you can't be gifting out to download like maybe like a corporate gift or something that not somebody's somebody did buy $500 worth of living in Seattle Seattle shows a maybe yeah maybe this is a good thing maybe you know I keep this is by the way the Segway into something I keep about $200 of McDonald's gift cards in my car to give out to people when I see them because it's a better than cash and I always have that on the street so like if I'm in my car people are you know asking for money I can give out these sometimes it's legitimate money and it was me that Adam McKay's and Mom did that McKay add an event gave us all some gift cards and it's a great way just talking about that to kind of give back and then you know that need to look for sizing McDonald's as at the Best Buy whatever there's something there for you all right Nicole Hollywood horror scary movie that we could drop it. Thanks love you guys left the show thank you for letting me know that is the capital of Canada the first thing that came to my mind as I okay if you want to go and do something fun that would be easy ish is you can be Chucky and the Bride of Chucky right that's a costume you know either you basically we wear the leather jacket over like a bridesmaid's dress and nude you some weird things with your eyes and you know he was a little kid doll and he can do the same thing with a red wagon like a pair of crossed or how about this would have your just kids at the camp from a Jason movie you just playing don't want no blood no anything he does their kids to the camp short shorts exhaust really unaware of the horror that a ways to dress up as any Halloween Horror Nights characters historical movie monster's movie I was obsessed with it was all about like how to do the makeup like Frankenstein and Wolfman I read that thing cover to cover like millions of times I'm still at just like when she said what would you dress up as it reminded me like can you get your cheesecloth for the Frankenstein forehead and it was all this guy it with like stuff around the end of June.

Take a listen to the trailer wedding ring around his neck was to be the biggest day of Tom Sanders career president puppy Meredith Johnson I do I had a thing with her but now his entire future, working for me. Like I usually do and hope it doesn't get any worse is about to fall into the hands and the family now is a lot more to lose than I do I'm not going to do this she said you sexually harassed her she harassed me not to see doesn't have any options I want to know whether I can sue her for sexual harassment very dangerous games just and just how you going to play it I don't tell me you're scared of me pushing too hard he has nothing to lose make a family house that we have made my phone was sitting on it can blow everything Sky High thought of losing millions of dollars have to get stuck right here disclosure unlike many of our films is available everywhere is a major motion picture made like hundreds of millions of dollars that you shouldn't have any trouble finding it but if you want me to like really guide you through it you can get it on iTunes you can get it on YouTube you can get it all the places Google Play credits of that and disclosure that we have a very special guest at next week that's right ahead it's get made all star coming in for a special in studio episode this all star called us up and said we must do disclosure any other reason why and we will get into that next week so stay tuned for that but enough about next week let's look back at you last week which of course was Katherine Heigl's Master as a villain in Unforgettable to see all the things that we might have missed in a little section I like to call Corrections and omissions directions to Mission One 90% right now yeah thank you Ed Carter using old sound clips for me when I was recording in my office at work okay Polly Darton rights I'd like to take a second to talk about Teresa and her mother singing Alouette jonti French traditional tune that a lot of people recognized from French class or pop culture in general but when translated is a fairly violent song the English translation lovely Skylark lovely little Skylark lovely Skylark I'll pluck your feathers off wowed never really put that together each verse then describes each part of the bird they will pluck the feathers from a telling song for two women who pick and pluck at each other and Lily metaphorically then perhaps it literally when Tessa angrily Cuts Loose Hair ultimately a smart little Easter egg for pretty dumb movie Wild thank you Polly Darton it kind of message boards which I love so much the conversation really goes on and never visited that you're wolf.com message boards we are giving you the best of the best here but there's a lot that we're leaving out true bring us to bring you so my gosh I know where that's coming from. You got to look up a couple more weeks away before that one it's my friend a lot of people in the boards are understandably a bit confused as to why Steve mnuchin had produced all these movie stupid who confounded Dune Entertainment of film investment company which later merged with Brett ratner's film financing that your rat pack entertainment ratpac-dune relies on slate financing to generate profit and has invested in countless movies especially due to its partnership with Warner Brothers some of these films like Unforgettable or collateral Beauty turn out to be flops others such as Wonder Woman and Mad Max Fury Road are profitable and well-received by critics and audiences those successes are expected to compensate for losses of the flops thereby increasing the chance that manukyan will earn money on his Investments so next time you're wondering why Steven sukin has producing credits on set a Chase Family Auto rate of films slate financing through June ratpac entertainment is your answer that is also been that partnership has ended after Brett ratner's me to Scandal but that's the thing I don't believe that she is producing any other films lately I think once he got a job in government that had to have stopped terminate rights I get why was may be more interesting to enter cut the sex thing with the bathroom sex scene but it also presents a super convenient clue that would have helped clear Julia had the police bother to do it like Castle a modicum of police work had they looked at the time stamps of the conversation that could have asked any of the other 10 people that Julia was schmoozing with at the time she seemed unusually preoccupied by her phone during the course of a moderately fancy business dinner and even if it was someone like well she did disappear for a few minutes I'm sure Copperhead group could have corroborated her whereabout sure might have been embarrassing but Julie has a really strong Alibi for what you was doing at that specific time not only that it's not like identity theft is completely unheard of for that Tessa doesn't have any motivation a detective worth his salt would have at least listen to her side of the story I think everyone in the movie was way too quick to dismiss Juliet right out of hand I mean she also said she didn't have any social media accounts I go get who her friends were I'm sure she likes for friends on add a Facebook account let's go to the phones Ryan hey Paul this is Ryan in North Carolina love the show and Durham for unforgettable two quick questions one am I the only one that felt like the husband was really not comfortable with the aggressively sexy moments at Rosario Dawson wanted to have in the bathroom during that lunch dinner psych if you're dating Rosario Dawson and she wants to have an exciting kind of quickie situation are you really are you mentioned a few times on your episodes about how you guys have impacted the search results and the viewing the box office for things I don't know if you've been to Amazon Prime recently but if you search for Deadfall the Nick Cage movies if you look up customers also watched the first thing that comes up the road Trinity Burning Love season 2 Drop Dead Fred the hottie and the nottie Miami Connection so yeah you guys are greatly impacting search results which is absolutely incredible thank you for what you do North Carolina I'll come see you anytime you're on the East Coast love you too that is amazing I've noticed that a little bit and to hear that list of films oh boy I love it I think he was like shy because he's like the head of a company making a very important like you know business investor meeting and he's a fucking in a club it's really not now yes yes but also know like I am like I like I can't I can't be able to mind I think it was your catching up but he did go through with it so it it just I think of the hesitation was more that okay Mallory what's up she instead of trapping her husband with a baby if you think that she went and Katherine Heigl Heigl character went and got pregnant and made him believe it was his child that she could trap him in the relationship I feel like she's crazy enough that I could be a possibility and I'm really surprised that they didn't take the angle that she trapped him with a baby that isn't actually I want to know your thoughts on that I'm kind of surprised that nobody else suggested that thinks Bob menery great idea but I think that she's even more duplicitous she was going to trap him with a baby like here's how I would think she would do it by like almost like puncturing a condom or something like that like you know like maybe that's what was going on there if we don't get into the specifics of that but I'm sure there's something at play because it feels like their marriage is on the rocks or maybe she figured out a time like I feel like she was very conscious of what she was doing I don't think she did you go out and be impregnated by somebody else if you're saying that you keep on having babies to keep me around I mean then it's like I'm Natalie Suleman situation which is Octomom thing we can't get in that way back to the boards trippalindee right I didn't treat Reese's final act as either a noble sacrifice or a response to her disfigured massage it was a compulsive action of someone put a manic crash and active tragically she looks at herself in the mirror and says why do you always ruin everything this seems like a line meant to reflect everything that our mother has told her all her life and that she had internalised over time which after years of festering manifested in a psycho behavior that we see culminating in a final psychological break and snap decision to assess her own worthlessness and end your own life though I might agree with Ecology Center stud on the other hand the defeated Dylan hurls herself to death is just kind of the cheap ending this movie seems to be peddling heywatchyourmouth trippalindee it's a great day I mean look at the trucks we don't have the truck so you can enjoy it while I think we love that this movie is it hits all the tropes and in his better than it should have been there it's better than it should have been a mall in I mean you got to have that final that final hurling yourself to the death ending blast hardcheese writes the final Stinger this Fillmore Tessa's mother love you Pops in and Julia is all I break now I have to deal with this crazy bitch doesn't even hold half as much weight as an implied if you think about it crazy though as she may be Lovey still just the grandmother Julia is certainly more self-assured than David but together they could still easily a certain ground rules in their own home in visitation with Billy when Grandma comes a-callin also Julia's positive influence with automated gate love is dysfunctional bulshit when she comes in from out of town besides what is Ultimate in it for love if she's on the crazy tip her daughter is dead and David's married to new woman the gravy train choo is grooming for a daughter's over so what's the point of trying to Crazy her up from here Vengeance baby blast blast blast do you not understand it anyting the bad guy in this movie is lovey that's the bad guy okay bad guys she created Julia because she herself is unhappy what's the make you think that she wouldn't do the same thing not for Revenge because she's fucked in their it's not about anything else she wants to read our own thing so yeah I be worried cuz I bet you got Grandma's picking her up from school go on a plane seating things doing things fucking up David and Julia's relationship you miss Reddit blast you done missed it anyway we had a really funny part of the show that happened in Durham to be cut out from last week's episode we want to play that for you now this is like a a little question emission in the audience gone wrong take a listen because of the loss of perfection both in her face and of the life that you could never get back she said it like she was going to win something all right and your question then you found out that she burn down the house when the house burned down my she Burton her childhood home know she burned down the new home that our father lived in with the secretary right we're to burn down the house didn't have the budget for that I did think I was weird when they were making out in the beginning and they're like this is your home your child at home we get to do it in your childhood bed of where I guess it would be like his parents bed it was weird it was a you're the daddy and I'm the mommy now I like sexy talk like when a girl climbs on top of what just like a mommy that's where the big bad all right we have a question up here what's your name why did she kill herself and what's your question but you raise your hand when I get back down here remind to take dibs on the thing that you didn't ask show me talking about it just wow guys a balcony fight has begun she accused the last person of stealing yes there's a question thief in the balcony it's the balcony they don't have morals keep your shit locked down up here people all right your question your new question and the person behind her did say it's not true okay also like just like give me the baby for a little bit stop acting like a bunch of lilies okay baby as a VIP pass all right Tessa and her mom where the mom is like I was trying to submit your relationship with David and I helped you get pregnant think there was like a weird I was just curious what that meant like how did the mom have our idea to get pregnant to do you keep David that they thought that she was nervous the David was going to leave or was maybe not going to be in it for the long haul and she said some version of if you got pregnant then you'll have them he'll stay with you something like that where she was tracking her ovulation to the day taking her temperature is Carmen I thought that the mom somehow got David a jerk off in a cup and then brought it to Katherine Heigl in a second location Hot Stuff amazing almost a fight anyway I got the winner wow so many good thought so many things to talk about I think the the the winner you know the real winner tonight I think is a person who really did the translation work that's right Polly Darton you

I'm going to get into it probably a little bit I haven't heard the whole thing so maybe changes I don't know but Adam McKay is producing this podcast called broken about Jeffrey Epstein that involves heavily one of the writers who broke this story at Julie K Brown from the Miami Herald and it's I don't know I'm finding to be really a fascinating fascinating stories of it's a discontinuity full but I don't think I understood the story as well as it was kind of compacted for me so it's been great I've been really enjoying listening to Broken Jeffrey Epstein so definitely check out that if you are interested in that at all I mean another topic is not like hey so fun but I bet it is it is is it very interesting also I want give a shout out to all my teachers are there and we have a lot of library that there but my 5 year old is in kindergarten and there's a great app for teachers I didn't even know existed and then why don't teachers about it if you don't know it's called class tag and it's basically like Facebook but all the parents from the class can be on it and then you can communicate with the teacher and teacher take pictures so if you're a teacher and you might want to introduce this to your your parents I know it's been amazing for me as a parent to see pictures of my kids at school to read what they're doing what's important to class tag and it's a great way to kind of have a great and simple communication with fellow parents and and your teacher so there you go that's my two pics very unlike one very unlikely and then the other one in the middle alright people just reminder we are going to be in Toronto September 28th some tickets are still available at the Just for Laughs Festival you do not need to buy a past you could just buy individual tickets it's at the Sony Center for the Performing Arts September 28th 1 show Toronto get on it people get on it and now it's time for movie Beaches to do a 2-minute review of 47 m maybe I like a lot but this not that one it's the sequel uncaged The Unofficial sequel to 47 Movie and they just added uncaged and they make no mention of any sort of death I mean they are due water I was watching this movie that's like I said anything to do with the first one at all it seems like they just had a shark movie that they just slapped 47 meters down on but then I realized same director is the same two races that shark movie The only comment seems our sisters young blondes lead who is unsure of herself and then by virtue of getting attacked by sharks throughout an hour-and-a-half finds her confidence in her bills her survive at least this movie on a whole I thought was better than the first one it's a better movie it was good I'm just saying I liked it more does setting was more interesting with like they might like all of the underwater Tour on paper a horror movie about women going Behavior flooring and getting stuff is a good that's a good horror premise I mean the last 10 minutes yeah I kind of like this movie just know this is one of my better ones of these riches and that is able to at least one of our producers here on how did this get made and her cohort Andrew golde they have a great
