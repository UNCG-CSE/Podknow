this episode contains explicit language revisionist history listeners Malcolm Gladwell here I've written a new book called talking to strangers and it's about the mistakes we make in our interactions with people we don't know talking to strangers features con artists and sociopaths and spies it talks about how drinking affects the way we make sense of others I spend time with a psychologist who ran the CIA interrogation program in the man who spotted Bernie Madoff before anyone else and I try to get to the bottom of a heartbreaking encounter between a police officer and a civilian which resulted in the death of a young woman named Sandra Bland in Texas I think it's a book that will prompt a lot of conversations and arguments which as you know from revisionist history is what I like to do I'm very proud of it and there's something else I'm proud of we talking to strangers after making four seasons of revisionist History I've fallen in love with a kind of Storytelling that can be done to a podcast and I decided that I wanted to bring that same approach to the audiobook of talking to strangers normally an audio book is just the author or someone the author hires reading into a microphone I didn't want to do that I wanted to make this audiobook of talking to strangers as compelling as an episode of revisionist History so if you listen to the audiobook you'll hear the voices of the people I interview and if I'm describing some historical event you'll hear archival tape for courtroom scenes we have actors reimagining what happened there's music and extraordinary song by Janelle Monae scoring we even have excerpts from other audio books and podcasts like the Fantastic believe from NPR in Michigan Radio I think the result is a completely different kind of audio book experience much more powerful moving engrossing anyway rather than described it I thought I would give you a special preview so here it is Chapter 3 of talking to strangers done the new way let's take a look at another Cuban spy story in the early 1990s thousands of Cubans begin to flee the regime of Fidel Castro boats made of inner tubes and metal drums and wooden doors any number of other straight parts and set out on a desperate voyage across the 90 miles of the Florida Straits to United States by one estimate as many is 24000 people died attempting to Journey it was a human rights disaster in response a group of Cuban immigrants in Miami founded Hermanos Al rescate Brothers to the rescue they put together a makeshift Air Force of single-engine Cessna skymaster and took to the Skies over the Florida Straits searching for refugees from the air and radioing their coordinates to the Coast Guard Hermanos Al rescate saved thousands of lives if it came here as time passed the Emma Grace grumer ambitious the Cuban airspace dropping leaflets on Havana urging the Cuban people to rise up against Castro's regime the Cuban government already embarrassed by the flight of refugees was outraged tensions Rose coming to a head on February 24th 1996 3 a.m. on Osiris got a plane's take off for the Florida Straits as they near the Cuban coast line to Cuban Air Force make fighter jet shot down to the planes out of the sky killing all four people aboard the response to the attack was immediate the United States Security Council passed a resolution denouncing the Cuban government a gray President Clinton held a press conference let us know, I have just been briefed by the National Security advisor on the shooting down the today in broad daylight two American civilian airplanes by Cuban military aircraft population in Miami was Furious the two planes have been shot down in international airspace making the incident tantamount to an act of war the radio chatter among the Cuban Pilots was released to the Press we had him we were tired them cojones we hit the buckers Mark the place where we were tired them this one little duck with us anymore and then after one of them big zero didn't II Cessna Homeland or death you bastards but in the midst of the controversy the story suddenly shifted a retired us rear Admiral named Eugene Carol gave an interview to CNN Carol was an influential figure inside Washington kid formally service director of all us armed forces in Europe with 7000 weapons at his disposal just before the Armando's El rescate shoot down Carol said teen a small group of military analysts had met with top Cuban officials CNN's Catherine Calaway interviewed Carol to try and make sense of it all Admiral can you tell me what happened on your trip to Cuba who you spoke with and what you were told and Carol says we were hosted by the ministry of Defence General Rosales Del Toro we traveled around inspected q and bases Cuban Schools they're partially completed nuclear power plant in Solon in Long discussions with General Lizella still Toro and his staff the question came up about these over flights from u.s. aircraft not government aircraft but private airplanes operating out of Miami they asked us what would happen if we shot one of those down we can you know Carol says he interpreted that question from his Cuban host as a thinly-veiled morning then Callaway asks so when you returned who did you relay this information to Kara replies as soon as we can make appointments we discuss the situation with members of the state department and members of the defense intelligence agency the defense intelligence agency the DIA is the third arm of the foreign intelligence triumvirate in the US government along with the CIA and the National Security Agency if Carol had met with the state department and the DIA he had delivered the Cuban warning about as high up in the American government as you could go and did the state department and the DIA take those warnings to heart do they step in and stop Hermanos Al rescate from continuing their Reckless forays into Cuban airspace obviously not Carol's Cummins ricocheted around Washington DC policy circles this was an embarrassing Revolution the Cuban shoot down happened on February 24th carols warnings the state department and Dia were delivered on February 23rd a prominent Washington Insider met with us officials the day before the crisis explicitly warned them that the Cubans had lost patience with Hermanos Al rescate and his warning was ignored what began as a Cuban atrocity was now transformed into a story about American diplomatic incompetence by February 25th when Carol spoke with CNN it's clear this perception had already sunk in Fidel Castro wasn't being invited onto CNN to defend himself but he didn't need to be he had a rear Admiral make his case is anything about Admiral Carol and the Cuban shoot Downs strike you as odd there are an awful lot of coincidences here first the Cubans Planet delivered murderous attack on US citizens flying in international airspace second it just so happens the day before the attack a prominent military Insider delivers a Stern warning to us officials about the possibility of exactly that action answered that warning fortuitously puts that same official the day after the attack in a position to make the Cuban case on one of the world's most respected news networks the timing of those three events is a little too perfect isn't it if you were a public relations firm trying to mute the Fallout from a very controversial action that's exactly how your scripted have a seemingly neutral expert available right away to say I warned them this is what a military counterintelligence analyst named Reggie Brown thawed in the days after the incident Brown works on the Latin American desk of the defense intelligence agency job was to understand the ways in which the Cuban intelligence Services were trying to influence American military operations his business in other words was to be alert to the kinds of nuances subtleties and unexplained coincidences that the rest of us ignore and brown couldn't shake the feeling that somehow the Cubans had orchestrated the whole crisis Turn Down For example the Cubans had a source inside our Manos Al rescate a pilot named Juan Pablo Roque on the day before the attack Roque had disappeared and resurfaced at Castro side in Havana told his boss is back home that are Manos Al rescate had something planned for the 24th that made it very difficult for brown to imagine that the date of the Carol briefing had been chosen by chance the maximum public relations impact the Cubans would want their warning delivered the day before wouldn't they that way the state department and the DIA couldn't wiggle out of the problem by saying that the warning was vague or long ago carols words were right in front of them on the data Pilots took off from Miami so cool range that meeting Brown wondered February 23rd he did some digging and the name he came up with startled him it was a colleague of his Dia a Cuba expert named Ana Belen Montes Montes was a star she been selected repeatedly for promotions in special career opportunities in bonuses who reviews were glowing she'd come to the DIA from the Department of Justice and in his recommendation one of her former supervisor has described her as the best employee hit ever had she wants got a medal from George Tennant the director of the CIA her nickname inside the intelligence Community was the queen of Cuba weeks past Brown agonized to accuse a colleague of treachery on the basis of such semi paranoid speculation was an awfully big step especially when the colleague was someone a bunch of stature finally made up his mind taking his suspicions to A dia counterintelligence officer named Scott Carmichael this is Carmichael talking about his first meeting with Rich brown pants and I don't want to do the wrong thing that slowly Carmichael Drew him out front had more evidence in a report in the late 1980s detailing the involvement of senior Cuban officials and international drug smuggling Celestron officers Ford Wrecking Ball and then provide the specifics I mean the whole enchilada in a few days before Brown's report was released the Cubans rounded up everyone had mentioned in his investigation executed a number of them and issued a public denial eBay dredge Brown paranoid 1994 to Cuban Intelligence Officers had defected and told a similar story The Cubans had someone High inside the American intelligence so what was he to think grounds at the Carmichael did he have reason to be suspicious then he told Carmichael the other thing that happened to need Hermanos Al rescate crisis the DA's office on Bolling Air Force Base in the Anacostia section of Washington DC when the planes were shot down she was called into the Pentagon if you were one of the government's leading to experts you and needed at the scene the shootdown happened on Saturday the following evening Brown happened to telephone asking for Montes he said some woman answered the phone and told him that I had left Carmichael says earlier in the day month is it got the phone call and afterwards she been agitated then she told everyone in the situation room that she was tired but there was nothing going on that she was going on this is just so counter to our culture that he couldn't you understand you're called in cuz you have some expertise and to the point you are available until you are just best that you don't just decide to leave when you get tired enrage Browns thinking if Montes really work for the Cubans they would have been desperate to hear from her they would want to know what was happening in The Situation Room did she have a meeting at night with her handler was all a bit far-fetched which is why Brown was so conflicted but there were Cuban spies he knew that and here was his woman taking a personal phone call and heading out the door in the middle of what was for a Cuba specialist just about the biggest crisis in a generation and on top of that she's the one who would arrange the awfully convenient Admiral Carol briefing Round Table Carmichael that the Cubans had wanted to shoot down one of the Hermanos Al rescate planes for years but they hadn't because they knew what a provocation that would be it might service excuse the United States needed to depose Fidel Castro or launch an invasion to the Cubans it wasn't worth it unless that is they could figure out some way to turn public opinion in their favor spin a story and I'm at the one who left months passed Brown persisted finally Scott Carmichael pulled Montes file she had passed her most recent polygraph with flying colors she didn't have a secret drinking problem or unexplained sums in her bank account she had no red flags if you destroy files a personnel file. I thought Ridgewood a share this woman is like she's going to be the next director is it in order to justify an investigation on the basis of speculation he had to be meticulous Reggie Brown he said was coming apart he had to satisfy Browns suspicions one way or another as he put it to document the living shit out of everything because if word got out that Montes was Under Suspicion I knew I was going to be facing a shitstorm chemical called Montes in in a conference room at Bolling Air Force Base she was attractive intelligent slender with short hair and sharp almost severe features Carmichael talk to himself this woman is impressive she said about to Park Central table I know that I can't stop eating she didn't answer it wasn't her idea at all the son of someone she knew a Dia had a company Carol to Cuba and she'd gotten a call afterward and he said hey you should go see Andrew Carroll on so I can call the panel Carolyn we looked at our schedules and decide who she was talking about he told her that he was going to call him up and corroborate her story and she said please do so what happened with the phone call in the situation room yesterday she said she didn't remember getting a phone call in to Carmichael it seems as though she was being honest it have been a crazy hectic day 9 months before what about leaving early. I did leave early that day and you know it was on a Sunday to use for closing a very picky eater I have allergies so I don't need stuff out of vending machine around 6 in the morning if I can line up starving to death nothing was going on they didn't really need me so I just sat out there it rang true to me after the interview Carmichael set out to double-check or answers the date of the briefing really did seem like a coincidence a friend's son had gone to Cuba with Carol all day long without eating well he turned his attention to other matters Ana Montes went back to her office all was forgotten and forgiven until one day in 2001 5 years later when it was discovered that every night Montes had gone home typed up from memory all of the facts in inside she'd learned that day at work and sent it to her handlers in Havana from the day she joined the DIA Montez Habana Cuban spy in the classic spy novel The Secret Agent is slippery and devious we're Hoodwinked by the Brilliance of the enemy that was the way many CIA insiders explain the way Florentino must be August Revelations Astros genius the agents with brilliant actress in truth however the most dangerous pies are rarely diabolical Aldrich Ames may be the most damaging traitor in American history had mediocre performance reviews a drinking problem and didn't even try to hide all the money he was getting from the Soviet Union for his spine Ana Montes was scarcely any better right before she was arrested the DIA found the code to use to send her dispatches to Havana where did they find those codes in her purse and in her apartment she had a shortwave radio in a shoebox in her closet Brian to tell the CIA Cuba specialist to witness the SBA disaster Dumont as well he used to work at something called a National Intelligence officer and I owe sit across the table from me at meetings of shot that I can beans but I was in I owe you know I would try to engage her and she would always give me the strange reactions when I was trying to pin her down at some of these meetings that I can paint try to pin her down I'm going to wonder why do you think the deer with the headlights and his eyes she she blocked me and she would even you don't you can physically see what kind of reaction said she's nervous because she's just such a terrible analyst she doesn't know what to say one year later Mattel says Montes was accepted into the cia's distinguished analyst program a research sabbatical available to Intelligence Officers from across the government where did she ask to go to of course she wants to shoot funded by this program can you imagine if you were a Cuban spy trying to conceal your intentions would you request a paid sabbatical in Havana but tell was speaking almost 20 years after it happened but the brazenness of her behavior still astounded him she went to Cuba as a CIA distinguished intelligence analyst and I'm sure that they gave her all kinds of clandestine tradecraft training while she was there I suspect she loved me to encourage them to congratulate them to Revel in the success that they were having so I didn't even bother to hide your biases there should have been all kinds of red flags raised and guns that went off when her paper was red by her supervisors because she said things about the military absolutely no sense except from their point of view but did anyone raise those red flags Hotel says he never once suspected she was a spy. We're supposed to mirak who thought she was the best Juvonen wish there was I don't trust her which of the wrong reasons and it's one of my great regrets I always believed I was convinced that she was a terrible analyst objectively she wasn't working for us I never connected the dots notice anyone else Ana Montes had a younger brother named Tito who is an FBI agent he had no idea my sister was also an FBI agent who played a key role in exposing a ring of Cuban spies in Miami she had no idea much as his boyfriend work for the Pentagon as well his specialty believe it or not was Latin American intelligence his job was to go up against spies like his girlfriend he had no idea when Montes was finally arrested the chief of her Section called her co-workers together and told them the news people started crying and disbelief the DIA had psychologist lined up to provide on-site Counseling Services her Supervisor was devastated none of them had any idea in her cubicle she had a quotation from Shakespeare's Henry V taped to her wall at eye level for all the world to see the King has note of all that they intend by interception which Daydream not of or to put it a bit more plainly the queen of Cuba takes note of all that the US intends by means that all around her do not dream of spies is not that there is something billion about them it isn't there is something wrong with us will be back after this I'm here with my new best friend Horace Cabot's rock-bottom II where the Lily white tennis and Country Club in exclusive Easthampton course I hear it's really hard to get into the lillywhite the wedding was too must be a mile long we have a pretty rigorous selection process merit-based like what kind of Sterling character strong back and a sense of Greater moral purpose Siri I just realize that you call is Rob let me help you with that if you're the lily-white tennis and Country Club of exclusive Easthampton choosing among thousands of applicants isn't that hard but if you're not the lily-white you need ZipRecruiter ZipRecruiter sends your job to over 100 of the web's leaving job boards but they don't stop there with their powerful matching technology ZipRecruiter scams thousands of resumes to find people with the right experience and invites them to apply to your job ZipRecruiter is so effective that 4 out of 5 employers who post on ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate through the site within the first day of Cooter because Mommy can't do everything right now my listener is confined ZipRecruiter for free at this exclusive web address ZipRecruiter slash Gladwell that's ziprecruiter.com Gladwell ziprecruiter.com Gladwell is 1599 at the height of the nine years war the Earl of Essex landed at Dublin with 16,000 troops Tomatoes way to the rebel stronghold in southern Ireland known as cahir Castle on a rock in the middle of the river sewer massive curtain walls 6th out Towers man with expert Bowman the castle was commanded by James goll D the brother of the 4th Baron of cahier and on the morning of May 25th the Earl of Essex symbol his men on a Green Mile outside of Clonmel so what did James galdi do when confronted with the Invasion From The Earl of Essex Diddy open Gates.

Talking to the interviewer search ask when Rachel s surrounding cheating her and ask her the same question what do you think she's going to say yeah yeah he is good his name everybody believes him Devine said I believed him Lucas was lying and I spent the better part of the morning watching his trivia quiz video tapes by the end I was ready to throw up my hands I had no idea what to make with anyone the pointer Levine's research was to try and answer one of the biggest puzzles in human psychology why are we so bad at detecting lies you think would be good at it logic says it will be very useful for human beings to know when you're being deceived Evolution over many millions of years should have favored people with the ability to pick up on the subtle signs of deception but it hasn't in one iteration of his experiment Levine divided his tapes in half 22 liars and 22 truth-tellers on average the people watching the videos correctly identified the Liars 56% of the time on a psychologist have tried similar versions of the same experiment the average for all of them 54% just about everyone is terrible police officers judges therapist even CIA officers running big spy networks everyone why Tim The Vines answer is called Truth default theory for tdt that came from one of his graduate students he soon park it was right at the beginning of the vines research what he was as baffled as a rest of his profession about why we are all so bad it's something that by rights we should be good at first one was in the 54% deception accuracy thing and you come to a different understanding if you break out truce how much people are right on Troost how much people are right on likes what he means is this if I tell you that your accuracy rate on the vines videos is right around 50% the natural assumption is to think that you were just randomly guessing that you have no idea what you're doing Parks observation was that's not true much better than chance I correctly identifying the students were telling the truth but we're much worse than chance I correctly identifying the students who are lying we go through all those videos and we guess true true true which means we get most of the truth or interviews right I'm most of the Liars wrong we have a default to truth or operating assumption is it the people that we're dealing with are honest Lance has his own experiment is an almost perfect illustration of this phenomenon invites people to play a trivia game for money suddenly the instructor is called out of the room and she just happens to leave the answers to the test in Plainview on her desk the vine says that logically the subject should roll their eyes at this point the college students threat stupid I signed up for psychological experiment to given a partner whom they've ever met who is egging them on to cheat you would think that they might be even a little suspicious that things are not as they seem to know so much that the living room might be set up when they almost never catches the other partners so they think so yeah right they think it might be a nice person to talk to they never question it to snap out of Truth default mode requires what Levine calls a trigger a trigger is not the same as a suspicion or the first sliver of doubt we fall out of Truth default mode only when the case against our initial assumption becomes definitive we do not behave in other words like sober-minded scientists slowly Gathering evidence of the truth or falsity of something before reaching a conclusion we do the opposite we start by believing we stopped believing only when our doubts and misgivings ride to the point where we can no longer explain them away this proposition sounds at first that the kind of hair-splitting that social scientists love to engage in it is not it is a profound point that explains a lot of otherwise puzzling Behavior consider for example what are the most famous findings in all of psychology Stanley milgram's obedience experiment in 1961 Milgram recruited volunteers from New Haven to take part in what he said was a memory experiment each volunteer was meant by a somber imposing young man named John Williams who explained that they were going to play the role of a teacher in the experiment Williams introduce them to another volunteer a pleasant middle aged man named mr. Wallace mr. Wallace they were told was to be the learner he was sit in an adjoining room wired to a complicated apparatus capable of delivering electrical shocks up to 450 volts if you're curious about what 450 volts feels like it's just shy of him an electrical shock that leaves tissue damage the teacher volunteer was instructed to give the lunar a series of memory tasks and each time the Lerner failed the volunteer was to punish him with an ever-greater electroshock in order to see whether the threat of punishment affected someone's ability to perform memory tasks as the shocks escalated would cry out in pain and ultimately he started hammering on the walls what is the teacher waiver the imposing instructor with herbs them on please continue the experiment choirs that you continue it is absolutely essential that you continue you have no other choice you must go on the reason the Milgram experiment is so famous is that virtually all of the volunteers complied 65% ended up administering the maximum dose to the hapless Learner in the wake of the second world war and the revelations about what German guards have been ordered to do in the Nazi concentration camps milgram's findings caused a sensation but to Levine is a second listen to The Experiment the volunteer shows up and meets the imposing young John Williams he was actually a local high school biology teacher in milgram's words because he was technical looking and dry the type you would let her see on television in connection with the Space Program everything William said Junior experiment have been memorized from a script buy milk on himself mr. Wallace was in fact a man named Jim McDonough he work for the railroad modem liked him for the part of Victim Because he was mild and submissive is Christ that I can eat with taped and played over loudspeaker the experiment was a little amateur theatrical production and the word amateur here is crucial the Milgram experiment was not produced for a Broadway stage mr. Wallace by Milgram Zone description was a terrible actor and everything about the experiment was to put it mildly more than a little far-fetched the electric shock machine didn't actually give shocks more than one participant so the loudspeaker in the corner and wondered why was his cries for coming from they're not from behind the door to the room where Wallace was strapped in and if the purpose of the experiment was to measure learning why on Earth did William spend the entire time with the teacher and not behind the door with the learner didn't that make it obvious that what he really wanted to do was observe the person inflicting the pain not the person receiving the pain as hoaxes go the Milgram experiment was pretty transparent and just as with LeBron's trivia test people fell for it they defaulted to truth as one subject wrote to Milgram in a follow-up question are I actually checked the death notices in the New Haven Register for at least 2 weeks after the experiment to see if I had been involved and a contributing factor in the death of the so-called Lerner I was very relieved that his name did not appear another road believe me when no response came from mr. Wallace with the stronger voltage I really believe the band was probably dead these are adults who were apparently convinced that a prestigious institution of Higher Learning could run a possibly lethal torture experiment in one of its basements the experiment left such an effect on me another road that I spent the night in a cold sweat and Nightmares because of the fear that I might have killed that man in the chair but here's the crucial detail Milgram subjects word hopeless the gullible they had doubts lots of doubts in her fascinating history of milgram's obedience experiments behind the shock machine Perry interviews are retired to maker name Jody Mo who was one of milgram's original subjects this is bizarre the motel Perry became convinced that Wallace was faking it but then mr. Wallace came out of the locked room at the end of the experiment and put on a little act he looked Dimo remembers Haggard and emotional it came in with a handkerchief in his hand wiping his face he came up to me and he offered his hand to shake hands with me and he said I want to thank you for stopping it when he came in I thought wow maybe it really was true Deemo was pretty sure that he was being lied to but all it took was for one of the Liars to extend the pretense a little longer look a little upset and mop his brow with a handkerchief and emo folded his cards who are the fools to tistics from the Milgram experiment 56.1% I fully believed he was getting painful shocks 24% although I had some doubts I believe the lunar was probably getting the shocks 6.1% I just wasn't sure whether the learner was getting the shocks or not 11.4% all though I had some doubts I thought the learner was probably not getting the shocks 2.4% I was certain to learn it was not getting the shocks over 40% of the volunteers picked up on something odd something that suggested the experiment was not what it seemed the dose has just weren't enough to trigger them out of Truth default that's the vines point you believe someone not because you have no doubts about that belief is not the absence of doubt you believe someone because you don't have enough doubts about them just think about how many times you have criticized someone else in hindsight for their failure to spot a liar you should have known there were all kinds of red flags you had doubts the vine would say that's the wrong way to think about what happened the right question is were there enough red flags to push you over the threshold of believe if there weren't then by defaulting to truth you were only being human more after this if you listen to revisionist history you know that we're big fans of parachute world's greatest bedding and bath and Home Essentials company designed in Los Angeles and responsibly manufactured by the world's best craftspeople podcast I can't show you how gorgeous like they're fantastic towels made from premium long staple Turkish cotton from the Aegean region with textured strips and a hand knotted Fringe I can't show you them I can only tell you about them which is driving me crazy so we've decided here at revisionist history to bring you sound a parachute ready that's my cat a tabby named Porsche kit cars sitting on top of my parachute quilt box patterned in call with softly textured linen front and crisp percale back I mean listen would push can be purring like that if you were lying on some second-rate dude a question doesn't think so and now that's me I take myself last night that is the sound of utter happiness and contentment the sound of someone sleeping on some insanely high quality parachute linen sheets crafted from the finest Portuguese flax okay this me and Pushkin together that is happiness my friends parachute Home Essentials so amazing you can hear the difference visit parachutehome.com Gladwell for free shipping and Returns on parachutes premium-quality very comfortable Home Essentials that's parachute home.

then received a master's degree in foreign affairs from Johns Hopkins University she was a passionate supporter of the Marxist Sandinista government in Nicaragua which the US government was then working to overthrow and your activism attracted the attention of a recruiter for Cuban intelligence United States V she made a secret visit to Havana and Patriots encourage her to apply for work in the US intelligence community that same year she joined to DIA and from there I was sent with swift Montes arrived at her office first thing in the morning 8 lunch at her desk and kept to herself she lived alone in a two bedroom condo in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington she never married in the course of his investigation Scott Carmichael the DIA counterintelligence officer collected every adjectives used by month has his co-workers to describe her it is an impressive list shy quiet aloof cool independent self-reliant standoffish intelligent serious dedicated focused hard-working sharp quick manipulative venomous unsociable ambitious Charming confident business like no no nonsense assertive deliberate, mature unflappable capable and competent Ana Montes assumed that the reason for a meeting with Carmichael was it he was performing a routine Security check all Intelligence Officers are periodically vetted so that they can continue to hold a security clearance shoes Brusque a responsibility to meetings and things to do in you just a matter of time Carmichael is a disarmingly boyish man with Fair hair and a substantial stomach he looks by his own estimation like the late comedian and actor Chris Farley she must have thought she could bully him yeah I heard that the graduation rate understanding a living room then she hit me with a gap and she would have me appointed a time and I hadn't settled in yet and that she said I would seriously I got to leave by 2 or some like that because I got all these things to do, like I guess what I'm thinking and so what you did that I didn't lose my temper Bridge inspector might be involved in a car Montes had been by that point a Cuban spy for nearly her entire government career she had met with her hand or at least three hundred times handing over so many secrets that she ranks as one of the most damaging spies in US history she had secretly visited Cuba on several occasions after her arrest it was discovered that Fidel Castro had personally given her a metal through all of that there hadn't been even a whiff of Suspicion and suddenly at the start of what she thought was a routine background check a funny-looking Chris Farley character was pointing the finger at her she sat there and shock she would just look in the mirror waiting for me to say another word just waiting to look back on that meeting years later he realized that was the first clue he had missed her reaction made no sense I just didn't pick up on she never said what are you talkin about she just sent down now if I'd been picked up on that mountain open Fusion anybody who's eventually they'll get in your face and I will really get in your face I didn't do a freaking thing as a Carmichael had doubts right from the beginning but doubts trigger disbelief only when you can't explain them away and he could easily explain them away how could the queen of Cuba be a spy, Michael told her I have reason to suspect that you might be involved in a counter-intelligence influence operation but he later admitted he said that only because he wanted her to take the meeting seriously I was anxious to get into it if I like I said are you Pat myself on the back and I work at shut her up mataharimall that crap anymore I'll get you this get this done they talked about the Admiral Carroll briefing she had a good answer they talked about why she abruptly left the Pentagon that day she has an answer she was being flirty a little Play It Again to relax he looked down at her legs again I don't know if it was conscious or what I do know is that catches your eye and we got more comfortable with one another and she came up just a little bit more flirty they talked about the phone call the day the plane was shot down she said she never got a phone call or at least she didn't remember getting one it should have been another red flag the people who were with her that day in The Situation Room distinctly remembered her getting a phone call but then again it has been a long and stressful day they'd all been in the middle of an international crisis maybe they just confused with someone else there was one other thing another moment when Carmichael saw something in her reaction that made him Wonder near the end of the interview he asked Montes a series of questions about what happened after she left the Pentagon that day it was a standard investigative procedure he just wanted as complete a picture as possible of removing set evening he asked her what she did after work she said she drove home he asked her where she parked she said in the lot across the street he asked her if she saw anyone else as she was parking did she say hello to anyone she said no you weren't thinking dinner time or going about stop making funny remarks every once in awhile. Stop it's that as usual and then all of a sudden has huge change came over and see it I want to know that she's just almost flirting stuff we were having a good time at that she was looking at me like and tonight but looking at me with that look like after her arrest investigators discovered what had really happened that night the Cubans had an arrangement with her if she ever spotted one of her old hand was on the street it meant that her spymasters urgently needed to talk to her in person she should keep walking and meet the following morning at a pre-arranged site that night when she got home from the Pentagon she saw one of her old hands are standing by her apartment building so when Carmichael asked her pointedly who did you see did you see anyone as you came home she must have thought that he knew about the arrangement that he was on to her and I look back in that and what did I do I did the same thing everyday I rationalize away baby shoes maybe she's been seeing a married guy and she hooked up with her married and she didn't want to tell me or maybe she's a lesbian and she doesn't want us to know she's worried about that I started thinking about Ana Montes wasn't a master spy she didn't need to be in a world where are lie detector is set to the off position a spy is always going to have an easy time of it and was Scott Carmichael somehow negligent choose default Theory would predict any of us would do he operated from the assumption that Ana Montes was telling the truth and almost without realizing it work to square everything she said with that assumption we need a trigger to snap out of the default the truth at the threshold for triggers is high Carmichael was nowhere near that point the simple truth ice Tim Lavigne argues is that lie detection does not cannot work the way we expected to work in the movies the brilliant detective confronts the subject and catches him right then and there in a lie but in real life accumulating the amount of evidence necessary to overwhelm our doubts takes time you ask your husband if he is having an affair and he says no and you believe him your default is it is telling the truth and whatever little inconsistencies you spot in his story you explain the way the three months later you happen to notice any unusual Hotel charge on his credit card bill and the combination of that and weeks of unexplained absences and mysterious phone calls pushes you over the top that's how lies are detected this is why the Cubans were able to pull the wool over the CIA size for so long that story is not an indictment of the agency's competence it just reflects the fact it's CIA officers are like the rest of us human equipped with the same set of biases to truth as everyone else call Michael went back to Rich Brown I tried to explain I understand your reasoning that you think that this is a deliberate operation I can't point a finger at all I have to say she was part of Liberty just a man shot in the end he says he just had to close out the case 4 years after Scott Carmichael's interview with Ana Montes one of his colleagues to dia met an analyst for the National Security Agency at an inter-agency meeting did I say is the third arm of the US intelligence Network along with the CIA and the DIA they are the codebreakers and the analyst said that her agency had had some success with the codes that the Cubans were using to communicate with their agents the codes with long rows of numbers broadcast at regular intervals over shortwave radio and the NSA had managed to decode a few Snippets they've given the list of Tibbetts to the FBI two and a half years before but had heard nothing back out of frustration the NSA analysts decided to share a few details with her Dia counterpart the Cubans had a highly play Spa in Washington whom they called Agent s she said agent s had an interest in something called a safe system and agent asked at apparently visited the American base at Guantanamo Bay in the two-week time frame from July 4th to July 18th 1996 demand for the DIA was alarmed safe was the name of the Dia's internal computer messaging archive that strongly suggested that agent ass was at the DIA or at least closely affiliated with the DIA he came back and told his supervisors they told Carmichael he was angry I have years how many employees call motherfuckers he was the Dia's counterintelligence investigator he knew exactly what he had to do a search of the DIA computer system any Department of Defense employee who travels to Guantanamo Bay needs to get approval they need to send two messages to the Pentagon system asking first for permission to travel and then for permission to talk to whomever they wish to interview at the base okay so two messages, Michael said he guessed that the earliest anyone traveling to Guantanamo Bay in July would apply for their clearances was April so we had a search parameters Travel Authority and security clearance request for Dia employees regarding Guantanamo Bay May between April 1st and July 18th 1996 he told his coworker Gator Johnson to run the same search simultaneously to heads will be better than one to begin searching to the safe system I'm going to go do this real quick I just need some time and that's when it hit that's what I'm pretty sure it's 20 Amos Trucking all over I mean it was over I was really stuck speechless. I could have I literally backed up and I was on wheels distancing myself from this Adams Carmichael said oh shit thank you for listening to chapter 3 of talking to strangers what we should know about the people we don't know I think this is what the future of audiobook sounds like and if you like what you just heard you can order talking to strangers on Apple Books head over to Apple Books right now at Apple.
