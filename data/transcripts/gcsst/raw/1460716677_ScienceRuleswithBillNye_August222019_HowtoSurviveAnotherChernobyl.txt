Calm and type on it I want to hear what's on your mind I want you to call me and we'll talk about science and and its rules it'll be fun so if you're like me and I know I am you have watched some of the Chernobyl episodes on HBO where it goes back up with British accents and then go she goes back over what happened in Russia when does nuclear reactor was allowed to explode and it's quite a miniseries and it's instilled a lot of fear in people it's a brought up old worries so ice important really though to understand what's involved in a nuclear reactor in which it wouldn't might be involved in a nuclear accident and how radiation affects us all everyday anyway and I'm once again joined of course by science writer editor and dear friend really for reals Corey S Powell greetings Corey hello build I'm feeling kind of rad today if I'm a bad pun you go but with that said yes Lauren Jackson is the associate professor radiation oncology at the University of Maryland school of medicine School of Medicine you say the University of Maryland and she is the deputy director of translational radiation sciences and director of the medical countermeasures program at the University of Maryland school of medicine in Baltimore Maryland here in the United States planet Earth dr. Jackson welcome welcome thank you so much sounds rad Oculus it's I'm sorry it's the only radiation you know radiation is a word we tossed around first of all and physics radio light is radiation microwaves radiation x-rays or radiation for you what is radiation using radiation so ionizing radiation essentially is high energy it can eject an electron is a particle or its x-rays gamma rays on ascension. Side of the spectrum Adam Joseph an electron and then there was can interact with biological materials so your DNA proteins and I can call Rochelle's so how did you get into radiation I fell into it does not sound good completely accidentally so I actually started out as a political science in a very interesting political science nuclear non-proliferation and then I became more and more interested in the Science World genetics radiation research has an unusual field to research yes it is so you you study the effects of radiation especially on people medical system human being a biological system for dispersal device that I like the sound of a radioactive commercial device a dirty weapon somebody steals nuclear nuclear material with a conventional explosive Chicago and everything sucks Subway somewhere outside of the media this is still a very active concern it is and so you're right that are spent this in growing worry amongst the government since 9/11 yeah there could be that we know that terrorists are trying to acquire these types of materials and so there's a huge effort to stop them from acquiring the materials but the government is also putting an effort to be able to medically manage and treat people if there was you know if there wasn't is discovery which is a real thing that we really did the premise being somehow after a nuclear weapon went off nearby we'd all live through it just go to the basement my family had taken steps forward to create the laundry make the laundry room into a fallout shelter but I got to thinking about it as you know when high school River this is ridiculous you never lived through it but your claim is you maybe you kind of could maybe you I could yeah that's correct so you know if you there's different types of in a nuclear weapons there's a conventional nuclear weapons which would be very high doses large-scale destruction and then there's the radiological dispersal vices are improvised nuclear devices and those have there's much more likelihood of survival particularly within the Fallout Zone what is Fallout it's a word I've heard since I was a kid nuclearfallout Garnet Dr radioactive material pieces of the bomb leftover ham left over because it's because he's already knew quite attached to the Dust yeah just sits physics electrostatic kind of attraction between Houston and there's debris and so that's carrying the dust up into the air and the radio is the radiation from the nuclear explosion causes the dust become radioactive or particles of that radioactive material attached to the dust trap so now we have a sky full of radioactive dust the ground need to be outside and so will be fall out and so you can see you can protect yourself from this Fallout by basically getting inside staying inside for at least twenty-four hours so Sheltering in place the dust will fall into the ground later reduce your risk for being exposed to radiation I want to clarify something waiting. How much of that is your waiting for the dust to settle out so you don't breathe it and how much of that is actually wait the radiation dose to go down because the most radioactive things are decaying during that time it's mostly waiting for it to go down or are you referring to so-called daughter elements right fishing and it creates all these other elements we see down the periodic table that are also given off neutrons and electrons and things like that there that will mess with your DNA when they hit you set the initial explosion yeah this is a very quick event and so people can get exposed to external radiation do to this high-dose and these people could be at risk for bone marrow suppression which is similar to what cancer patients might give chemotherapy it's the same kind of biological effects that the Y blood cells about cells that fight infection can be lost and so people can be at risk for infection and these are higher doses of radiation exposure but then there's a second part that's the fall out and that's where we have drugs that can treat the bone marrow suppression bummer if you can get people triage and medical hospitals for treatment but the extra internal contamination and exposures from The Fallout can be significantly reduced if you get inside there's two types of radiation exposures there's external radiation exposure and then there's internal radiation exposure swallowed radioactive radioactive iodine and so it would be is very similar you know it's the same type of iodine reacted that way after Fukushima would have been released and end up on the ground and the half-life of that has eight and so over real couple months is going to basically be eliminated from the environment one of the things that you want to do almost immediately is basically stop the food sources for those areas making it into the cycle let's go to the phones we have Tiffany on the line Tiffany are you there yes I sure am I bear greetings where you calling from sunny beautiful Detroit Michigan which it will be that way for probably another four hours on the email and measured to try to extend the sunny. For a couple hours but before we do that or what is your question okay so I was wondering should I be as concerned about radiation nuclear plants as I currently am I recently learned about the nuclear reactor accident in Chernobyl as a kid but now that I've been watching the HBO miniseries about it and kind of researching the long and short term effects of radiation poisoning I'm a little bit terrified and so given the accident in Chernobyl and Fukushima both of those nuclear disasters happened in my lifetime I'm really just wondering how this type of thing can keep happening number one but also is there anything that we can do on the ground and protect ourselves I don't think we're in the blast zone or anything like that here in Detroit but it is definitely something that my partner should I worry about a little bit more me than anyone in a lot of people are in the same boat especially after Fukushima a few years ago so I would say you don't need to worry I think that an endive and a lot of other people in this field have really been trying to push your radiation risk communication and yes there were the psycho psychological impacts of those types of incidents are actually much much worse than the actual so what is so here we are Fukushima we had an earthquake tidal wave tsunami height screwed up the reactor the kind of show they kind of buried in cement is that right yeah and so very little radiation escaped I mean a health perspective the increase lifetime risk for anyone who is in that area relative increase of developing cancer at some point in their lifetime over just a natural background risk is less than .0001 perceptive and so basically there was no there were no health effects and from Fukushima both after Chernobyl a lot of people developed what we call a lot about a hundred 234 of the workers developed what we call a cheat radiation sickness and this is light immediately life-threatening and out of those 24 individuals topics dying from radiation illness others were successfully treated but how do you die from radiation sickness from infection from bleeding. Case you know you had that it was a volatile accident it was a fire and so it's a little bit different was Fukushima yeah there was never heard of amounts of radiation that was for least there's no health effects from that nobody cut it off in time doses for high enough and that's where containment is really you know all the facts were something that would that be the bad health effects came from something else what is that psychological a higher suicide rate amongst individuals from the Fukushima prefecture than the surrounding prefectures and so you know in that area and because there's what we call radiation stigma and so hey I don't want to touch you or alcoholism of people because heart drinking because people don't want to Bicycle people don't want to socialize with you so you start drinking this ain't nothing but a lot of people people died he said they have to spare and so that's actually when you're talkin about those types of accidents and if that's really where the the major issue isn't so we've been pushing that you know you need to educate the public before these types of incidents happened because that's the major health outcomes Lauren you have for a for a brown so what do you do to educate people what are you all but you all at the University of Maryland University of Maryland school of medicine what are you doing to educate people a lot of people on Twitter trying to get the information out there I see a lot on LinkedIn but I don't think we're doing a good job out of it. A lot of people I just came back from this meeting I mentioned to you at Munich is certainly something that people are talking about and it's becoming more and more I think relevant more recognized that people know that we need to better educate the public of what the real risk but I don't think that we've really put in the necessary steps to do that to somebody with a card table at the airport or on the street corner with the slogan more nukes less Cooks I'm sure that he or she meant fewer books but that aside I didn't I didn't study English for a reason and that's correct. It's very safe overalls extremely safe Tiffany you referred to Chernobyl and Fukushima but I am of an age where we had Three Mile Island Harrisburg Pennsylvania where nothing happened but something almost happened and people did Panic and the whole thing everybody the problem is if u f 430 some commercial nuclear power plants excluding military reactors and three of them have big problems that's just not just not a good 3 out of 400 is pretty bad where you you wouldn't get in a car with a 300 400 chance of crashing so that's why people are concerned and then I see some disagreement coming from our expert nuclear power and they haven't had any accidents although those power plants are aging and what are we going to do with the Aging part that aside so Tiffany you have do you still have a fear of nuclear power or did dr. Jackson just ale that fear set it aside immediately and you are now a happy michigander well you know I trust no one you know we're not educated on that and I went the pretty good school throwing up and they kind of touch something but really made it a point to kind of skim over things because I think they thought it would be a little too over the average person's head and I wish that we had more people talking to us in the type of transparency that you guys are giving cuz that's really helpful so that if there's a dirty bomb let's say you're on vacation what did I say earlier Chicago I mention Chicago's in the middle of the electrical grid and there's a nuclear event stay inside for 24 hours do not go running outside to go find your kids strangely enough right that's right I have shelter in place at the great at the at the preschool and at home basement if you don't have a windowless basement just go to the middle of you know any building that you can don't leave for good for one day and strip if you've been outside take off your clothes were required to take a shower write the rent to get the dust off or beta emitters they can't penetrate the skin and so you might get skin burns Alpha emitter the only way you can you're going to get damaged if by inhaling or ingesting it and so if you remove your clothes you can really minimize open Beta are the particles of an atom has an electron and Alpha is basically a helium nucleus of these are particles that can't travel very far it's right after you brought up the question that almost everybody has wondered who lives

basically so if you ingest radioactive you know I'll really died from milk sources or something that's been contaminated then what you want to do is take potassium iodide because it basically floods the system takes up the pill you take iodide rather than the radioactive iodine prevent the risk of thyroid cancers which is one special case and is really predominantly children that would be at risk do we have you just offhand I was just your immune system is suppressed so are these drugs sitting around in an emergency rooms waiting for a new clear they are at work yeah their warehouses so the federal government has put in over six billion dollars to develop what we call Med medical countermeasures For seyburn Thread agencies are chemical biological radiological nuclear agents over the past 15 years 6 billion over 15 years with respect this not that much money is money is spent has led to the approvals of three new drugs for treatment of radiation sickness couple reasons not everybody would need it you don't want to just give everybody drugs that can potentially have side effects these have very low side effects we know because we're there given to cancer patients to treat side effects of chemotherapy for example but they are in warehouses and they are in hospitals and they would be used in the aftermath of a radiological or no clearance spectacularly hypothetically just so crazy dangerous it seems you said three drugs what are the three drugs I do you catch in Alaska birth from engine and lucayan from partner Therapeutics and all three of those are now approved these drugs basically stimulate recovery of the white blood cells that fight infection and so you reduce that window you are narrow that window that people are at risk for life-threatening infection cuz that's what kills you it's part yep that's so and so how does radiation kill you Corey. There are several ways the first is this bone marrow suppression that can occur and so you lose your ability to fight infection and so people die from infection the other is that it also radiation can affect your vasculature and so it can calls and also a blood cell type call platelets that allow that help blood help blood to clot heart vasculature is your it affects your blood vessels and so people can since we began bleeding and if they don't have platelets they can die from it since they're trauma-induced Hemorrhage glass blowing in your face by the explosion and then you bleed to death cuz you can't fight how long does it take for you to not be able to clot is it instantaneous, yeah give people blood transfusions until this platelets come back on just message with my DNA messenger DNA that we can't solve the other a lot of drugs out there that try to help the DNA repair itself that are being tested there's over a hundred drugs that are being that are in the early too kind of you know intermediate stages of development for acute radiation sickness the big program managed by the government there's a lot of pharmaceutical companies that have drugs some of the drugs are already approved and you stay in the hospital to treat various illnesses and sometimes what's I think it's time for some calls yes let's go to the phone it's go back to the phones we have we have Annika here and Annika my very first question to you is am I pronouncing your name correctly where are you calling from Anika I'm calling from the University of Waterloo and Ontario Canada the radiation that comes from the power plant is that actually reached the general public and our environment have a long-term if it dies are there that's a really good question I mean it's certainly you know it's those of nuclear power plants are very well contained and so you know it is certainly should not be releasing any sort of radioactive materials into the environment but what everybody's concern I think is the three accidents that were Troublesome and then nobody really has an intuitively good way to dispose of nuclear waste even if it's a small amount if you got to store something for hundreds or thousands of years you're talking on timescales of the Roman Empire it's pretty hot tea to think your government's going to do as well as the Roman Empire that I never related at Power questions at following up. What about radioactivity from coal plants are they significant radiation emitters I don't know this really outside of my expertise my expertise is really younger what are the biological effects of there was an accident so I don't really have other type type syrup unusually or do they have a higher level of radiation exposure than the rest of us ask a question probably uranium and thorium population specially if I may Anika in Canada with tradition of socialized medicine and government involvement and so with all that said go ahead please I just don't think it is in other words that part of the nuclear industry is is very well controlled very well understood and very well controlled but what's happened historically is because nobody can agree on what to do with the nuclear waste its stored now at all these power plants and people talk about putting it in a geologic structure on big caves where nobody goes and it would be underground and out of out of sight and not out of mind but out of range but the infrastructure for doing that is complicated and how do you move it through somebody's home town without the terrorist showing up and causing trouble and you could read cycle the few and make it even more of okay and so on and so on but if I understand it dr. Jackson people are more afraid of radiation than they should be is that accurately and I think you're exactly right in India nuclear power plants they're not leaking into radiation into the environment and even if the doses would be so low that it would not cause an increase in cancer incidence among the population of population around it so there's there's in my opinion no need to be concerned I wouldn't be concerned she wouldn't be concerned thank you very much for your call Annika enjoy the beautiful summer weather in Ontario science Rules will be right back getting promotional products shouldn't be rocket science weather is Penn's water bottles or travel mugs quality logo products can put your design on just about anything placing an order quality logo products is fast easy and simple because their patented website search functions help you limit that selection by what's most important to you whether it's your budget or the date you need your items delivered better yet what you see is always what you pay Simply enter your order quantity and instantly see a precise breakdown of every pricing detail right on the screen no hidden fees and shipping is included plus you have a dedicated 100% human customer service professional to keep you updated every step of the way you know what the planetary Society we get our rubber mini asteroid stress balls from quality logo products they're not real asteroids and they're not they're not really balls but they are they do relieve stress that's that's one way to tell they're not real asteroids so had to Quality logo.com and use the code science Rules to save 10% on your order that's quality logo.com and use the code science Rules to save 10% you don't listen to science Rules now in a separate but unrelated issue I think has to do with the word radiation so we have another caller about this is that a true fact or false fact that is a half true fact you forgot to consider the third possibility we got a question and the color could not make it onto the so I will be playing the role of John and the role of Johnny I have a question for you. So recently I've seen a number of videos warning us of the dangers of radiation emitted a new 5G communication Towers their claims of peer-reviewed studies Etc do you and do Bill and you have an opinion on this have you seen the science on it if there is any is this is also a dangerous kind of radiation so I will say that's far outside my area of expertise my expertise is an ionizing radiation and that is non-ionizing radiation scientific opinion no I don't think it probably has any effects of radiation you mean it just doesn't have enough energy to correct. Those electrons losing make your maker atoms chemically active so the 5G system works with the same phone you have now so it's almost certainly not going to affect anything so there's this time you know I'm a big skeptic by that I mean literally both both both in them that's what we do when we do a fist bump with a lot of drama using the same phone there are billions of phones and very very few people have any any affected all the problem is when you drop your phone you've been down you hurt your back that's very dangerous and there's a famous incident in the skeptic Community I'm in both the the Skeptics and the committee for scientific inquiry CSI and there's a famous incident where a real estate agent in Florida and her husband had a picture of her honest on her cell phone and she got brain cancer correlation does not mean causation as we say so just cuz you saw this one picture of this one woman who happen to get brain cancer which is very troubling it doesn't mean the fan absolutely does not mean the phone cost it if cell phones were really as dangerous as some of these extraordinary claim or claim I mean so many people with Dad Dora tumors or whatever that is the amount of energy emitted and received by mobile phones is Tiny and it is not as you say doctor ionizing radiation these are not beta particles are alpha particles it's it's electrics radio wave dim light bulb radiation because they like your Wi-Fi runs on radiation and 5G uses radiation so what is the difference between these different types of radiation make you can kind of decode that alpha beta particles gamma rays x-rays high energy it can essentially knock out an electron out of its orbit leads to an unpaired electron and then those molecules and ions and now they want to find you know that electronic somewhere else and so they pull it from the DNA or they try to pull it from other some other cellular what we call macromolecule and it causes damage your mess up the molecules in the cells and then at the cells get messed up and you get sick and in the worst case you get really sick and so now the neighboring cells even if they weren't exposed to the radiation they start putting up the fence has Mountain defenses because they're getting those fire alarms going off you know hey we got a problem whenever I think about radiation that we used to it now we have sieverts that's a measure what we used to have RADS and right and you should be accurate we still use curies and back rolls it depends on what type of radiation talking about you know if you're talking about in a radioactive decay my eye focusing on Grace we use Grace mostly we just want to kill one joule of energy per kilogram tissue which is equivalent in a liter so there a kilogram of humans weigh about as much as water right pretty close so it's like so that's a joule per kilo would be a millage renewal Percy see if that's if it's if it's that simple alright so with that said or that complicated how do we know how much of a jolt average becquerels RADS what's the what's the other one I watched the pants about biological dose it's really hard to estimate so you can estimate it by determining what we call lymphocytes depletion kinetics how fast do they do you lose them or they die so as they drop their living like counts to put you on the spot where these done with a primate models as they're called but yeah if you can if you're doing a controlled exposure you can prescribe a specific dose and in that case we have radiation physicist who come in and they do the calculations and then they would prescribe Subway we doing clinical radiation therapy you can prescribe a specific radiation dose for the research right now speaking of non primates well you mean my old boss is it a myth so if people at high altitude you would expect to get more radiation has less atmosphere blocking charged particles from our own stud life-giving Sun control for that you know how many flights people can you know how many storms can fly based on exposure natural background radiation exposure so you do get higher doses of radiation exposure when you're flying the famous one is the banana what happens with a banana I'll let you tell me know it's a regular potassium radioactive potassium in them because they are high concentration of potassium bananas are one of the more radioactive foods so bananas allegedly has enough radiation to to set off somebody's ultra-sensitive radiation detectors I would need to check that any of these these detectors with pick up a little bit higher doses of radiation pants because they're so sensitive very weak source of radiation but they are a source of radiation have to Google that with that said without it what what what is happening bill I think that the clouds nearby are discharging their into the ground or from the ground to the cloud on a heated super heat in the atmosphere so quickly the gas and creating free radicals we smell as ozone which is O3 but more importantly the lightning real lightning round lightning round so here dr. Warren Jackson we are going to ask you to answer these questions the best part of quick questions quick answers living at high altitude what's your favorite form of radiation gamma rays can you develop a pill for radiation sickness so that I can go to space and not have to worry about radiation leaves that you could develop a vaccine to radiation vaccine keep blazing radiation hormesis so he thinks you could Prime yourselves that is all very theoretical right Prime yourself how long would this vaccine last like an hour or 2 years or your whole life probably Eris you know whole life okay just you worry about radiation when you fly doctor now would you live near a nuclear power plant it would what is the best depiction of radiation in the movies or television what's the worst that's a good question but a lot of them don't do a very good job thread I have not seen it but one of one of our my colleagues who is a radiation biologist has said that this is one of the best feelings because if they had actual radiation biologist I consulted on the film it came out it came out right around in time of the day after in 90 1983-84 one thing that comes to mind where you yelled at Springs have bothered you so much after it's as a high-level it's really that writes what you would you want to be able to see in the future with your research everybody to have radiation and where it's your First Responders at the local level and I think Physicians we need to do a much better job at educating our medical community that would be the ones to treat individuals who've been exposed to radiation they need to understand what to do and how to treat medically managed those individuals about radiation what would it be that yeah that there is this fear of radiation that is not proportional to the real risk of radiation. Your work is just beginning has been a great discussion doctor you are going to change the world by educating people about the true effects of radiation it really isn't important thing and it for me it's not just that both my parents had forms of cancer and I like anybody else I'm concerned with cancer I'm of a certain age people from high school or no longer waving because of cancer. That's bad and something that were thinking about but also if we are going to embrace nuclear energy as a way to have zero carbon emission electricity in the coming years because we got to get her done we're going to want to understand the effects of radiation and how we manage it and so with this is as big a picture ideas you can imagine both individual medicine and the future of planet Earth for us humans shake or there is going to be here no matter what we do at least for a few billion eventually it's going we have been sharing the microphones with dr. Lauren Jackson associate professor radiation oncology at the University of Maryland school of medicine school of medicine and director of translational radiation sciences and director of the medical countermeasure program also at the University of Maryland school of medicine in Baltimore Maryland here in the United States planet Earth doctor thank you so much for coming in and telling us about radiation this just been a fantastic discussion looking for a pun it's been it's been ionizing it's been thank you Doctor Jackson I'm Bill Nye by the way I'm Corey S Powell and remember when it comes to the radio act science Rules and if you like science Rules please take a moment to rate and review it in apple podcasts and on Stitcher it helps us out and helps us know who's listening and who was enjoying the show course it helps other people learn about the show so they can enjoy it too and turn it up loud so thank you sorry it's rules is produced by Jordan Bell or engineer today is Jared O'Connell mixing an original theme music by Kacey Hall and special thanks to wear science Rules Stitcher Magellan TV brings you the finest documentaries from around the globe they offer documentary movie series and exclusive playlist with 13 different playlist curators specifically for new programs are added on a weekly basis and can we watch anytime anywhere on your TV laptop or mobile device Magellan TV is compatible with Roku Amazon Fire TV Apple TV Google Play on iOS you can even take it from your phone to your television get your exclusive to month free trial today at Magellan tv.com / science Rules that is as one might expect Magellan tv.com science Rules
