on it and then it is a type of salad is the judge are you what's going on right now can I enjoy sad hey everybody I'm Michelle buteau and I'm Jordan Carlos and welcome to adulting from WNYC Studios old is a special one for software saying in the studio so we can talk to Irish comedian aisling Bea her show this way up just hit Hulu and it is amazing how she's doing the house and she's doing all the things she is booked and busy but she here with us I can't wait then we answer your adulting questions with the man behind the air horn DJ. and also we could done with Christian Benda who produces Our Lives show and Jordan can I just tell you are we recording Joe so I mean everyone freezes in this way up is there anything that was like 2 there was too sensitive for you to talk about or did you work your way through with everything I'm supposed to stand up I've decided to not pull out the bits of the show which are from my life and from nose so I am at yes for anyone who just listen again I have a new show on Hulu go this way up facing I wrote this article about 2 years ago about my dad suicide and it's not something I talk to her before it all on the pink I went viral and I wasn't quite a taboo subject a nobody talks about ice and in a way the show is a little bit of my comedy response to the people who got in touch cuz I couldn't get back to everyone there was no physical way I could get back until to the most people so Irish and English people are better at making sad thing funny I don't know maybe it's where maybe we're really okay with it so my show people have started describing couple of shows a side comes and I've I've never described as a comedy that deals with issues but like no big deal for me and you I think I can stand up naturally we see how do I deal with the things that are coming in my head all the time and make it funny cuz it's true it's not our job to do TED talks like hey guys never tell me how she told about something properly at the jokes are over and so I think that maybe in the UK and Ireland that's why I sent it is within sitcom writing right so I kind of hate would be like another sad, I know it's a comedy just said everyone to stop being uncomfortable for example if you look at the office the UK office is way darker than often so both of them exist and they're both amazing forums but they're not a direct copy of each other and Steve Carell put warm then like you love help and where Ricky Gervais Brady push into the Hulk wasn't even that area of London where it's at so funny and I find hilarious but what it is I think it's a comfort with us have you ever had a breakdown before I went to this is the question that's all the shows are to go by so yeah so from me I genuinely this is like cuz I'm someone said to me oh you know you can have a price on Sir if you want but one thing I told him I suppose felt I lost a little bit was for a little bit of privacy of my own private stories with the show what is fiction and but there are little tribes of everything in there and the problem is the more profile we all got what pets do you protect or even like what words do you discuss with your family your partner is your friends that's suddenly you're like oh no I'm sensing that off actually yeah it's hard because that's the opposite of what you want to do this and that is it the one they going to make chicken wash I'm going to maybe protect him which of my life and my show this because I've made a fictional character to deal with the different things that are in the end that's maybe that's okay and I I hate maybe that I've got to that stage this year in particular but a lot of my life has been the middle one from the have what I love about you media is like you're an advocate for everybody so it's like you know you can still I feel like have a piece of you out there and people know what your heart is but they don't have to know everything you've been through which I think maybe so here's a little bit of information at these two people I don't know that long but I became so fond of you both I'm genuinely you can just tell people so will straight away I first met Michelle we were doing our mini Netflix specials at night Atlanta and there was one of the twelve of us and totals around like that we were on the same like one of nights and I hadn't had a great month that you're not that you would have known that an icon from London at my pals at little baby passed away and I've gone from luggage lady's funeral to London to LA riots in front of Americans 15 minutes and then into Atlanta and I just got really Wiggy I'm just tired and overwhelmed and I don't think I might have been when the last peoples going to get attached to the Netflix show so I didn't know you farted funds but I was also really I just really highly strung and I wasn't sleeping when I got there and I was going to tell you because I think of you and your and your hotel, an expensive go cuz it was a w w zaveri knew it was in the pipes I mean I'm not going to play that goes I could not tell that you were going through and I mean everybody has a nervous but because we're the nervous energy and also we been kept in the hotel and might be so for like 2 days then we go in a little baby lullabies Helen and I brought to do like a depressed fits on your hair and makeup tests on try out your sass and I decided a cuz when I get nervous I speak a lot anyways for my words sometimes don't come out that fast and I was also very wise in foreign country other than that many say foreign immigrants on the bill and that I was talk show me a picture of the temperature in Atlanta what is the richest deal with this time I won't jump in I have one on every day and a great place to go every direction I remember just a particular and again you wouldn't have noticed there's an end in the same way but you just never know when like a little hay or a connection with someone can sort of make their day and you and Sabrina jalees weirdest so what's going on to me I don't like someone just asked her being like just so nice I need another few gigs are not a member I died of this wooden gate when I was in New York and you're like those people fuck am I do like the whole time and I was like sometimes you just need on that that takes a slight moment I was someone else's day but can just mean the world and in a moment thank you absolutely everyone thinks like that again International comedian and so you know it's it's one thing my poop is it the mic is one thing like going poop and I was like who is Mike score from me what do I do what are these American Express bite the bullet public radio staff you know but now I have feel like going to another Comedy Club it feel like you're going to another school you know you mean you're a freshman and Senior yeah I have been to a lot of different schools I'm an only child and I just I always love when a company will like to be nice to people Yeah by all that's not the first time we met the first time we met was at UCB show in LA are the members and I remember I was writing a list of not like my jokes what things I had to do and I will never forget you're just like you shouldn't write list cuz here to beat yourself up for not getting to them I'm like wow now that's an amazing nugget an element of focused riding last which is great when he just need to get soap out of her head what if we rewrite too many lessons in our to-do list basically what you're setting yourself up for is an element of a getting your dopamine I'm writing this thing. I'm not from achieving the thing and also setting yourself up to like oh look at the things I didn't get to this day rather than just some days going what can I do is manage and give myself a break to get better and you'll remember if it's important enough okay so we have some questions to answer about insulting so our guys what age do we start buying / drinking wine that is more than $15 over 30 I tried early at like 23 and couldn't maintain that I didn't have the money for it but I wonder is that one of those things where you're like wine should cost more than $15 but that's actually not alike shine organic Blend or something from another year if you don't have to always get something in the same year come on now, you know what I learned or something when is it okay if you can actually afford something or if it is blurred God where are you I know that's a good question. I'd like the vacuum cleaner that's phone that is not working kind of like keeping 3 by charges for no keys you don't know anymore except for 18 and now I've heard if you have six times the amount in your account then you can buy that's a lot of amount of abundance says don't behave like it's not going to come in then the poop hits the mute the mic hashtag hashtag thank you so much for being able to watch it once I get a look at him alright alright Michelle it's that time yes please let's go I got to go pee just adult diapers not working adulting is supported by betterhelp offering licensed professional counselors who specialize in issues such as depression stress and anxiety and who give counsel through text chat phone and video sessions can start and under 24 hours because sometimes you just have to talk it out best of all adults and listeners get 10% off their first month with discount code adulting so why not get started today go to betterhelp.com adulting fill out a questionnaire to help them assess your needs and get matched the counselor betterhelp.com adulting unclaimed about inhaling I hate to tell you about the open house projects and you put gas from WNYC studios in wqxr in which people share stories about the classical music that gets into that lives people like threat Justin Mendez musicians Jon Batiste and Wynton Marsalis call your girlfriend and very own Alec Baldwin thought mixtape Sonic love letter listen to free wherever you get your podcast and sign up at open house projects.
