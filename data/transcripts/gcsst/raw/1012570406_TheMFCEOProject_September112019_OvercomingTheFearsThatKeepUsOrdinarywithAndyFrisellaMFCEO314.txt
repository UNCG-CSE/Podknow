I can stack them hundreds to the roof and stop until I reach my family wouldn't have food anybody what is up guys you listen to the mfceo project I'm Andy I'm your host and I am the motherfuking CEO guys as not always but I always say always join me is my amazing handsome buff podcast host that you guys have a million nicknames.for but he has more nicknames than you I will always have more nicknames DJ dude what's up dude I'm doing 75 hard or de Leon 12 is it going I believe well it's going actually really well there's only one way that's the key thing about 75 hard it's either going to ask you little questions that drive you crazy like I actually have a question I'm asking you so that I am so that you know you moderate your response but I'm so I am very good about keeping to my keeping to my diet right here's the problem I have the way that I manifest dress is I lose my appetite so if I don't eat enough yeah am I disqualified yeah bro listen you know I'm saying like that's because you're a heart your what's called a hardgainer man yeah you're naturally a very thin guy who has trouble putting on muscle and that takes even more distance what people don't understand like everybody always wants to talk about how hard it is to lose weight list I've been in this business for 21 years now it is honestly much harder for someone like you and ensure they want to go then it is for someone to lose weight because it's it's it's it's harder I will say it requires the exact same amount of discipline you know a lot of guys who were thin or people who are thin they want to get weight they go out and eat this big giant meal once or twice a day and I ate two Big Macs and two large fries but you didn't eat anything else the rest of the day but you know what I mean so it takes a lot of discipline to constantly eat when you have to eat by the clock yeah I know you do. That's absolutely true and the truth is as weird as you well know when you do discipline yourself to eat regularly you do end up having more of an appetite absolute yeah and so that's what that's what I got all right well I'll start over then there's no question for this is an adjustment you making your diabetic you know I'm saying like I'm not this isn't something like there's people out there when you have a diet and you seem like you're supposed to eat 2500 calories a day no one really actually hits 2500 they're the ghosts were so one day you might be a 2300 one day you might be at 2700 but it's what's the course that the overall body of work that you're doing for the next 75 days if you shoot for that Target number and you're around it you're going to get the results so dude just make just get focus on that you know I'm saying you haven't cheated no I'm not disqualifying you just lock it in right right now I appreciate you doing it and doing it perfectly and if you do a perfectly the results are fucking massive know you're right but I will tell you this I almost willingly started over because I do take seriously what you say about like the first five to seven days I was doing everything yeah but I don't know how intentional I was so I was like the intent starts to grow as as you start to progress this is normal in some ways I feel like the first five days just happened to be not super busy days for me so I was like ours is no longer yeah but going back real quick before you get into about it is interesting when people not necessarily people like me cuz right now it's not like I'm like crazy skinny but when when people are grow up in there really super skinny yeah they don't get any sympathy from people like none so lucky but do they have the same problems overweight people have bright clothes don't fit right they're embarrassed for sure. Nobody feels sorry for the really think that this is a legitimate think it's like people who their whole life they've been like crazy good looking and so nobody takes them seriously as people because they just got to look at like women deal with this you know but try to let a woman complain about the fact that she's always judged because she's so good-looking and no nobody nobody takes that since I have so few women. There's a few women in Authority who are very successful Norte Syndicate they all of them up express that to me they're like do we feel like no matter how successful we get people take our concerns are serious and not you know what I used to be someone who was like yeah that's bullshit right but do not seen it like I see it now you don't say it like I've seen the way people interact with successful women versus men I seen the way people treat my own wife versus the way they treat me right you know what's funny is is my Emily runs Arte and she runs my personal and these people will email in to get me a route to speak or on their show and they don't realize they're talking to my wife and it's like it's funny because it really good First Wok gives you a real good idea of what kind of people they are you know what I mean they're the kind of people who fucking you know treat waitresses and waiters like shit you know and looked an alarm because do they use the quickest way to get me to not do anything for you yes you know if you treat my people bad which obviously I just say it's not just your wife who was kind of snooty with us and it's it's it's a it's a character thing you don't get into a little bit different topic of what we're talking about but you know I feel I feel like Society is getting better about that but the truth is man is there some bad ass fucking women out there that are kicking ass right but nobody ever hears about because they're maybe they're not vocal maybe they're not they don't need to put everything on a social you know what I mean and the truth is I wish some of these women would really step up and social media because dude I honestly feel like a lot of her better on newer than the man that's what ya know I agree and are sure it's really you know I learned so much stuff from from the successful women that are around me and see if there's a different way and see the world in a different way in a business in a different way it's just you know it's like what we were talking about people out there cuz I never really looked at right like you I just don't I don't look at someone and think successful woman successful black man or a successful black women motherfukers and thank fucking successful right right right right but dude there's not a lot of there's other people out there that that don't do that you don't actually think business is the one area of human life where it really is a meritocracy like people don't care if you're black white or whatever I'm going to get into the politics here but I think if you're I don't care who you are if you're a woman and you know how to build a company you're a wind you're going to get paid out you're going to get paid I just sell it like right now we have so many we have such so many social movements for you know empowerment of this group or that group look man if you want to get empowered gone fucking P everybody right no matter who you are if you think you need to be equal go out there and prove that you ain't loyal and not because you're worse because they're not equal to you right you know that's the mentality that needs to be taken it's not hey we need special attention because we're disadvantage you just got to be that much better and Shove It Down motherfukers throats that's the truth and what the respect go in and and you know what all the women I know that are winning agree with that yeah they're like fuck it I'm going to go do it anyway that's not love that she would anyway you haven't talked about that for her dad. Course I need a ton of money to come in and say are you guys fired up oh my God we're we're kind of a lot of money dollar smile like the dude we won't say who because he's a good dude but a friend of ours kind of recommended this guy in and In fairness to our friend I mean we thought this guy was doing a awesome he look like he had a pretty good resume this is like literally with a local conference Andy was a keynote speaker this local conference is it was the do it anyway conference and we hired a guy that was going to be the MC and apparently he was supposedly this great announcer the quote-unquote million dollar spot smile texted like they make fun of them he did his he did his he did his due diligence like it looked on paper it looks like this guy was guys this is what happened literally literally this is what happened this announcer dude comes up remember this is Andy frisella is the keynote speaker right so this guy comes up he looks like something from I don't know who's that guy from Las Vegas he looks like a fucking kid Wayne Wayne Newton plastic human yeah so this guy gets up and we're waiting for the you-know-what waiting for like the voice in the NFL stuff right and you guys and he comes up and goes are you guys fired up dog dude no dude this guy you ready to do it anyway mother fucker needed it intro would he was supposed to be the announcer he's one of the pictures we actually shouldn't believe it out we should actually say who it is that that cuz he's a great dude killing for those of you who are so he's a total stud and it's really really wasn't his fault after the performance coach for University Alabama more importantly and things contenders Kansas State University but he's got all sorts of like he's really done. He's awesome he's he's a mental toughness guy and I remember it being you and Ben were all sitting say Table Rock what the fuck is going on I remember this in front of him he said are you serious I'm so surprised guy and had to say cuz we were sitting on the side of the stage and I remember the guy tell him that he's like you got to say got us a million-dollar smile like I said just like that right why would you want to spend a million dollars when you smile that was like the second event in my life so I didn't know if that was real like like you know of course I'm trying to pretend like I know what the fuck I'm doing and I didn't know it still went really well it was great but like you the funny thing was is that it sounded like a member he said he kept on saying condone but he was mispronouncing it as condom I swear word that he was mispronouncing it sound exactly like condom or semen or something I'm talk to bed, and remind you never mind remember sitting inside of the stage like I remember sitting there dude it's like actually it's weird reminiscing about it because like you now it's like four years ago was longer than that yeah I mean it's just weird cuz you know we go to advance and it's like a it's like a pretty big fat idea you know it like like all of us but like do you remember stand on the side of the stage like everybody could see us that's there a sheet of paper with the million-dollar smile like in trowing the intro guy what the fuck are we doing that's the guy we paid intro us you know we were doing dude did I think we print it out banners on your on your copy machine like literally on the competition so all this to say guys what are we talking about I will let me just say this to this day it's one of my favorite podcast we've ever done is well that yeah 107 if you haven't heard 107 is is when the day is usually the best part in it but what I was talking about was there's another one that's early on is Kyle you have to be bad before your bad ass and we were bad yeah and and people don't realize that there has to be a process and you have to be willing to to suck before you're just like bro I just spit like a reason that we've been delayed so long today is because literally spent the last two hours talking to a friend of mine who has a company here in St Louis okay he does Bloody Mary mix he does peppers and he's getting into some other things his name is Tony Patton Tony is a really good guy got a big heart good dude makes great product he's he's over 50 all right he's a little bit older dude the guys lived a lot of Life man and I was talking to Sally and I were in the back in the office talking to him on the phone you know we were like his first customer at the supplement superstores we saw his peppers and marketing as like a healthy alternative which it is put on your food when you're driving and it really makes it better and he does make an awesome Bloody Mary mix but he's he's you know he's do he's in the beginning stages and if you wanted our help and we're sitting there talking and we're getting it but he's telling us this and he's telling us that he's telling us this I dig down to the the deepest root of the issue is having he's like bro I just don't feel like I'm worthy to fucking be successful you know and I'm like I'm like Tony and I like I like I like I can do and everybody listening those I can do I started dominating the conversation you know I interrupted him which by the way guys I know I interrupt people I'm trying to be better about it so stop fucking telling me I interrupted you haven't interrupted me in over a year does not like consistently that's because I've been trying to be a thank-you + you actually have good things to say so I'm trying to you know like I get excited when I start walking and people that you know people take that the wrong way they take his I'm being rude when the reality is Passion you know honestly knock it off in the Santa but that's the way my family is my was raised I was raised by easterners I told you the other day that I for your voice a day like I raise my voice with somebody in our extended family and they walked out and I could not believe it I was like seriously I know you're like that because you tolerate me the easterners no offense easterners but actually like kudos to you guys you guys know how to express yourselves but I'm not a midwesterner when it comes to my I'm not either you know I'm not either you take some from New York or there's the East Coast somewhere because of exactly or for some reason but literally this person would be cool to be literally this person my wife and I were like in tears laughing about this literally this person went and told somebody else that they thought I had an anger problem and you know me right and that I was an unsafe and potentially violent person bro it's all those muscles you got me first of all that's how we all feel we all feel that way you know what I mean like dude all of us feel lost all of us feel like we don't know what we're doing none of us feel like we like I can remember back when when I was just getting started when I suggest going to start I mean 10 year the first 10 years my business not the first fucking 10 months the first 10 years that's just getting started to me bro I felt like the biggest fucking father was I felt like any day I'm going to get exposed for not knowing what the fuck he's doing and everybody's going to say he's full of shit and every my whole world will crumble down on top of my head and it'll be over that's how we all we all feel that way if you're listening fucking podcast and you don't feel that way good for you but you're probably lying but I bet there's times that you do actually feel that way absolutely I was telling him dude fucked up but I always think about like really weird shit I used to like think that eventually someone somewhere who I found was credible in my space right at the time when I started in business it was guys like Bill Phillips or I who is I mean Sprite change more lives than nearly anybody on this planet and a guy have tremendous respect for there's there's other guys who I got to know Jeff and Eric Hillman who owns Europa sports who became great friends of ours and still are great friends of ours but these dudes like I used to always think that I had have their approval in order for me to be successful you on say it which I couldn't get the bill because he was so big and I was so little probably how people might feel about me now you know where they're like they're like I can't you know you know I'm saying it's just there's a lot of space in between ya and I and I used to think that if they didn't they didn't believe in me or if do you know who ever successful in business didn't believe me I was going to make it right and that's just not true there is no co-signing of sex you know what co-signing means it means like you know when one rapper has the young rapper and the older rapper says this is the new guy coming up and then everybody follows the new guy coming right or they put them on the track that's a cosigner there is no co-signing and Entrepreneurship it's not something that's real but it's something that we think is real when you're first starting out we think that we got to have so-and-so's approval or our parents approval or our teachers approval or Aunt uncle's approval and if we don't get everybody's approval there's no chance that we could be successful guys I'm here to tell you not only is that false and you don't need anybody's what's really happening here is your convincing or that you're not qualified you're convincing yourself that you don't have what it takes you're making up conversations in your brain about what might be said if you do what you're thinking about doing which ultimately create a situation where you are hating on yourself and because you hate on yourself you don't do anything because you say to everybody else is he to you when it's really you. Is fucked up so that's exactly what people do man and dude I'm talking to this guy who is you know he's got great scared to death cuz duties and he's a little older man and I'm like look brother fucking Colonel Sanders became one of the wealthiest people on the Earth at the age of + 60 + you all have time and you guys were older right now and you're thinking how have the time fuck we live in an age where there's instant everything there's instant social media there's Instant Tax their insta email 30 years ago when other people were trying to build shit you had to fuking send a letter there and then wait on the leather to come back like the the speed at which we can collapse time from from let's save the previous era where we say ten twenty years were you can collapse down to say five years fuck if you're 50 years old or 55 years old and 5 years we live in a completely different fucking life that's amazing so I want to add something about that because I love the point you're making here when I see Pastor used to tell people like especially with when they're really old and they had kind of made a dumpster fire of their life and in there like it's too late to really change anything I said no I would use to tell no not all days are equal in the hands of God and what that means is that I know guys basically were crappy husband's crappy fathers with something happened and they made a change and I know a guy that like made a massive changes his life he died a year later of of pancreatic cancer and I was talking about that with somebody and they were like, that's a bummer that you only live one year the way he was supposed to live all along she said yeah but here's was kind of amazing if you would have asked his son who I was really good friends with he says the only thing he remembers about his dad was that one Goodyear like like all the previous years were erased because of all the good that he did that one year so what what I the way I apply that to visit it is huge and people need to realize that's like time is like I said not all not all days are equal in the hands of God I mean God God can do an amazing things in one day that would have normally taken a whole year or even a whole lifetime in the same way people need to press forward and overcome this fear that you know that they're running out of time because as you well know you can labor for 15 years in business and all of a sudden within the space of six weeks in 8 weeks make ridiculous amounts of money because everything finally comes to a you know that's what people I think we talked about this a few weeks ago that's what people don't understand about the compounding effect of creating skill sets right right like dude when I say like when I say and we have to be careful as as people that other people look up look to you for advice like I talk to garyvee about this all the time you know it's very hard for us to say information and for everybody understand the context you said I'm saying that's so when I say dude I fucking cry my ass off for 15 years 10 years with barely any pee people can get discouraged by that but what you have to realize is that wasn't a different era that was in the era of zero social media 00 useful internet email was a really huge thing text messaging wasn't a huge thing you certainly couldn't fucking communicate the way we can communicate today so all of those things collapse the time frame so when I say 10 for you it might be for right you guys are in this awesome position and here's what the other thing that nobody really ever talks about which is the truth in the beginning you don't know shit you have shit for money got shit for brains you got shit for product your shit that's reality we all start there but what happens over the course of time we develop skills are products get better our connections get better our ability to have resources and reinvesting a company becomes a thing then what happens is since you started with zero it might like for me it took me 10 years to get the ball moving all right but once I got the ball moving and I started to get some income and I start to have some relationships like the ones I mentioned before now all the sudden I'm able to do what took me 10 years in one year now I'm able to do this dude I make more money more money in a fucking month now than my company sold the first 10 fucking years not Maine to 10 years sold in a 10 years right people on earth yeah for sure in a month that's what people don't understand OK your progress is going to accelerate with your growth of skills and resources and connections so you win this is this is this is real shit this is why people fail because they don't want to they pay that price for 5-6 years right and they finally get to where they're making 60-70 $100,000 and they're like fuck this is how hard it is how hard is it going to be to make $1000000 and so even though they're making a hundred thousand they think the same way they thought on day one when they were making a dollar right there like dude it's going to take me another 5 years to get to 200,000 dude I think that kills more fucking ambition and more success than any other thing Absol is people not understanding that your efforts compound and your your your Investments compound even your time investment your money invested with your connection Investments the Investments you making your team that shit compound and when it all comes together man it creates this Whirlwind of a machine okay but most people quit before they get there that's just pictures of Lily and I listen I don't want to pick on your friend but I think there's another aspect of this that is this kind of mess you always say that early on in your business when things were going well you and Chris said that he said you know what what if we what if we never make any money off of this right and you said I had this idea that once he starts making the big money he's going to be happy not but you know I'm saying when you first started when you first started doing your peppers cuz then it was a one-man show he first started four years ago okay that would be over 21 years so that would be what 18 years 17 years okay where I first saw him doing his Peppers you know what I was doing you know what both of us were doing we are working a bodybuilding show at a table all right so I'm talking to him and he's like dude right I got to get back to basics and I'm like Tony it isn't anything more than the basics that's where people fuck it up it is the basics set you know where I met him I met him at a fucking bodybuilding show sampling peppers and I'm sampling protein shakes 17 years into my fucking company jumps and I call you motherfukers out there you think it's Rich dude you fucking delicious of trap music and takes picture of this fucking cars no I still go to fucking events I still do those tastings I still do that shit that I did back in fucking 1999 you guys just don't see it you know I'm saying and so what these people don't understand is that the basics are the business it's not I got to get back to the basics when you get away from the basics when you get off track but I was talking to him exactly what I said exactly what you just said I said I said I said Tony when you go do to tastings on a Saturday when everybody else is watching football and all your buddies drinking beer cuz he loves Notre Dame football when everybody's doing that stuff and you work two vents to tastings for two hours each and you talk to a hundred different people that day how do you feel when you got done he's like dude I feel like a million bucks and I said that's because the work makes you happy that's right you're some Sam absolutely dude the happiest I am is after the hardest I work it's just the way it is and so counter-intuitive the way people want to live because they're taught Kickback dude take it easy man you need to relax quit taking shit so serious and you know what maybe they are a little bit right maybe you should just assume that if you keep doing the work you're going to be where you want to be because that's the truth so maybe you should just relax how would you feel stress wise if you knew that you would be where you want to be 20 years from now you feel good you have less stressed and I'm telling you the weight of be happy while you're doing it is to take pride in the daily work that you do and look at other motherfukers who were doing the shit that you quote a quote are supposed to be doing like sitting on the couch Saturday eating a fucking Papa John's Pizza drinking a fucking Budweiser like the whole society will tell you your do that right they go to B-Dubs they get a fucking beer they watch TV on the big screen that grunt their men no motherfukers men are the dudes who passed that shit up to provide for their families and the people they care about and create jobs and create the shit okay that's men boys are the ones that go do all that shit I'm not saying you can't do it once in awhile I'm just saying if you're if you're going to build your happiness on something build it on something that actually makes you happy not on something this society says it's supposed to make you happy agree 100% drop that mic motherfukers guys as so often happens this is not even close to what we originally had planned we we you know had some notes and such but you know the Holy Spirit Led a different direction sure did because that's what I do really we ended up at the way I would sum it up as we end up talking about fear fear that you don't have what it takes and you need validation and he says you don't validation you got what it takes you just need to put it into action secondly is fear that you're running out of time don't think that way think of time is relevant think of it is compounding as I said all not all days are equal in the hands of God so just trust to put in the effort and the the crop the result will come and then finally I would say the fear of basically there's some magical formula our secret sauce that you don't know it ain't easy answer is no it's the basics back to the basics you stick with the basics and you'll be the best in the business basically just write Jenn to Zayn and the four point is be cognizant of how your success is going to accelerate don't think that because it took you 5 years or 7 years to get an $80,000 position in your career that you're not going to get to a $280,000 position the next four because right now you're more skilled you're more connected your Maurice and you have to understand that with the society that we live in and how fast it can be for us to communicate that timeframe can collapsed so your parents are going you're going to say no, to build a million dollar business and you sold $10,000 this month I'm going to build a 10 million dollar business and you sold $10,000 this month your parents say it's going to take years no it's not but what will take you 20 years and this is the dangerous part for you guys is to fully understand how to fucking do it you know I'm saying that the money is going to come before the understanding for a lot of these people so they're going to get rich they're going to make money Elite dangerous part you know I'm saying so but she'll understand that while to the success might not take as long keeping success is going to become more more rare because of how fast I can come right now so that was my last Point know that's good.
