emerge of the factors that shaped the man he grew up to be Suge Knight was born Marion Hugh Knight in Compton on April 19th 1965 his father Marion Knight senior was a janitor while his mother Maxine worked in a factory according to Knights friends he earned the nickname sugar bear as a child because of his sweet and unassuming demeanor although he was aggressive and intimidating to his Rivals he never hesitated to protect those who were close to him as he matured sugar bear morphed into Suge earning him the now-familiar name Suge Knight lived in an environment where threats assaults and even murder where an ordinary part of life Compton of the 60s 70s and 80s was ground zero for the war between rival gangs the Crips and the Bloods each group feuded for territory where they could sell drugs and their competition frequently erupted into violence from a very young age night learned that if he wanted to be safe he needed to seem so tough but nobody wanted to risk messing with him in his world there were only two kinds of people Predators or prey if he didn't want to find himself the victim of a robbery beating or murder he had to be willing to Rob beat and kill ironically local gangs were both a threat and a protection night knew that if you join the Bloods he'd make an enemy of every crew in Los Angeles but the alternative was to have no gang affiliation whatsoever which meant no one would have his back if you ever found himself in a dispute with someone bigger or stronger Knight decided the benefits of membership outweigh the risk he became a lifelong blood when he was a teenager by the time he reached High School Suge Knight was well-known among his peers as a small-time criminal his hulking frame helped him intimidate classmates who had hit up for money it also made him an accomplished lineman on the Lynnwood High School football team a four-year to sport letterwinner night was recruited to join the University of Nevada's Division 1 football team

finished strong enough that the 22-year old was a serious Contender for the NFL draft in 1987 brought in as a scab to play for the Los Angeles Rams during his brief professional football career Knight played into uneventful games he didn't stand out on the field but behind the scenes he was a frequent Target for bullying thanks to his status as a scab and to be alone and the NFL wasn't really nice crew anyway his loyalty remained with the Bloods of Compton the NFL strike ended and night retired from football after less than a month with the league he soon found that his bulky frame and intimidating demeanor left him well situated for other career paths and in 1990 he accepted a job as a bodyguard to singer Bobby Brown Sugar needed to be ready to step into a tense situation and start punching if necessary steemit powerful producers and artist and got a firsthand view of how the music industry really worked to learn that money was power and of course power was everything since the late 1970s rap and hip-hop had been underground genres a few albums were surprised successes suggesting the public was ready for rap to hit the mainstream New York had produced some Rising rap stars but the West Coast didn't have any major powerhouses yet hip hop music manager he connected with fellow producer and Rapper Dr Dre and the pear founded Death Row Records in 1991 when night was 26 one of the first artists night managed to sign was composer Mario chocolate Johnson a minor Ghost Rider with no hits to his name yet and it was only a matter of time before night found that the same brush violence that put in at the top of the food chain in Compton also helped him cement himself as a force in the music industry in 1990 Johnson reportedly wrote a song called Ice Baby to be performed by Vanilla Ice before they had even formalize their professional relationship Johnson mention tonight that the rapper hadn't given him proper credit I was withholding the royalties that were rightfully his Johnson was already suing Vanilla Ice but night thought he could resolve the matter a lot more directly immediately launched into a harassment campaign against Vanilla Ice he stocked the rapper showing up at restaurants and other public spaces where he knew he would be 9025 year old Suge Knight visited Vanilla Ice in his 15th floor suite at the Bellagio Hotel ostensibly to negotiate a resolution to his dispute with Johnson Vanilla Ice thought that he was safe on home turf Suge Knight wouldn't threaten him and his very own hotel room but soon after night and his posse arrived the music mogul suggested that he and Vanilla Ice chat out on the balcony or Charles Drury about what happened next in one version of events night drew his gun and ordered Vanilla Ice's bodyguards off the balcony they heated the threat leaving the two men utterly alone night begin to Muse on how unfortunate it would be a Vanilla Ice with a slip and fall over the balcony railing and another version of events night didn't have to threaten his enemies so directly he just made a pointed look over the railing and Vanilla Ice knew exactly what he was getting at night grab Vanilla Ice and held him over the railing letting the rapper dangle over a 15-story fall asleep his slip would leave him plummeting to his death not Vanilla Ice was dangled over the banister he took the message to Heart in 1990 he resolved his dispute with chocolate Johnson signing over the rights to Ice Ice Baby play there Vanilla Ice discuss the incident with the Press describing Suge Knight's tactics he said I needed to wear a diaper that day I was very scared and I know I wasn't the only artist intimidated by Suge Knight's Antics as rumors of his violence circulated night earned exactly the reputation he'd fought so hard

to the story in 1990 after founding Death Row Records twenty-five-year-old music mogul Suge Knight threatened and possibly assaulted rapper Vanilla Ice in a contract dispute the attack followed a lifetime of aggressive posturing and asserting dominance a pattern that would only get worse over the course of Knight's career according to rumors Suge Knight's Behavior toward Vanilla Ice was the rule not the exception he was never slow to threaten other parties in negotiations he flashed guns at label Executives and always went out a company by two hulking bodyguards only helped his career his rivals fusion his client's deferred to him and his customers love the authenticity of a real-life gangster criminal producing gangster rap music has rap music exploded into the mainstream in the early 90s Knight rode the wave of popularity to new heights of Fame and power and he didn't save his threats for Rivals even the musicians he personally represented weren't safe from beatings threats and intimidation tactics met with his client Lynwood Stanley and Lynn Woods brother George night regularly showed up late to these sorts of meetings intentionally it was his way of asserting dominance show is the minutes tick By Night left the Stanley Brothers alone in his Lobby when he finally emerged from the recording studio night spot in Lynnwood placing a call from the company phone night order the men not to use his phone's the musician argued that it was just a quick an urgent call his brother George tried to intervene but night's fire was already aroused because of nights of session with power he knew that any hint of weakness could be deadly if he let these musicians disregard his request his reputation would suffer he may as well wear a Target on his back unwilling to tolerate what he saw as severe disrespect night flew into a rage beating them in Lynnwood and George ran down the hallways trying to escape night chase them punching kicking and smacking them along the way finally he cornered them with nowhere to run the brothers try to apologize but it was too late for that enraged Suge Knight ordered his musicians to kneel on the ground the men complied then he drew a gun from his holster the musicians trembled in fear wondering if Suge Knight was going to shoot them then and there they could feel their hearts racing as he approached rather than fire on the delinquent rappers Suge Knight struck Linwood in the face with the handle of his gun the force of the pistol whip cause the Weapon 2 misfire discharging a bullet harmlessly into the wall night concluded the beating with a bit of psychological dominance I ordered the Lynnwood Brothers to strip naked and lie on the ground until he granted them permission to leave complied Linwood bled from his head that he shivered on the cold floor finally after what felt like an eternity night allow the brothers to leave has the men dressed night warned them that if they went to the police and have them and their families killed unfortunately for Suge Knight The Brothers soon found their courage again hours after the incident police stormed the Death Row Records Studio denied he done anything wrong but a rudimentary investigation returned a bullet hole in the wall and the pool is Stan Lee's blood night was let out of the studio in handcuffs thanks to efforts from his lawyer night didn't go to trial for 3 years mean while he continued to grow his music Empire when he finally reach the courthouse he plead guilty and received a suspended sentence in Practical terms that meant he wouldn't serve any prison time but the conviction would remain on his record and his ability to travel would be somewhat restricted suspended sentences are not unlike parole but they're issued in place of prison time although the sentence was light night once again reach the benefits of establishing himself as an authentic criminal from the streets the media reported on the dangers of rap culture and how children needed to be shielded from the violent content made by brutal men these reports just made rap fans won't the albums all the more and night reaped the profits Is frequent collaborators Snoop Dogg shot and killed a man in a Los Angeles Park he was arrested and charged with murder only increasing Death Row Records profile and bolstering night's business ultimately Snoop convince the jury that he fired in self-defense and he was acquitted that pattern would soon be typical for night he and his artists could break the law with impunity and as his power as a hitmaker grew so too did the body count more trouble arrived in new york-based rapper Tupac Shakur his numerous hits already made him a star in the rap industry and according to rumors he was out growing his relationship with East Coast rapper notorious b i g Notorious BIG otherwise known as Biggie Smalls was a friend and frequent collaborator with Suge Knight but friendship could only go so far in the Cutthroat rap industry and he never let their relationship get in the way of a business decision so night made Tupac a generous offer to record a track with death row Tupac accepted and Night released an album that competed directly against Tupac's managers Weeks Later Tupac was scheduled for recording session with Biggie and November of 1994 quad recording studios had offices just off of Times Square to Bach arrived alone and right on time Tupac waited for the elevator two men carrying 9 mm handguns enter the lobby wordless Lee they opened fire Tupac was struck five times after he crumpled to the ground the gun men robbed him taking tens of thousands of dollars worth of jewelry before they fled the bleeding but still conscious Tupac was alone in the lobby he didn't know how long it would take for the next visitor to arrive and call nine-one-one he needed help and fast when the elevator arrived Tupac climbed inside and hit the button to the 8th floor where the quad recording studios sweet was Tupac stumbled out of the elevator to find Biggie Smalls Big E's manager Puff Daddy and another rapper waiting for him when they saw the stadium is in they seemed utterly unsurprised in a calmly called 911 Tupac survived the shooting and stayed in the hospital less than 24 hours although his injuries were far from healed he insisted that he was too exposed and didn't feel safe from the shooters unless he was in his own home with his own Security Police could find no leaves in their investigation the rapper thought he knew exactly who the shooters were he confided in Suge Knight that he blamed Biggie Smalls and Puff Daddy today known as did he or Sean Combs one way if the New York managers came at his client they were essentially coming at him letting it go would be a sign of weakness night needed to assert his dominance when the source awards were broadcast live from New York City in August 1995 Suge Knight took the stage and publicly insulted Puff Daddy he said any artists out there that want to be an artist and stay a star and don't have to worry about the executive producer trying to be in all the videos all on the record dancing come to death row this line was a comment on Puff Daddy's tendency to record guest tracks on his clients albums in one Fell Swoop Suge Knight insulted Puff Daddy's management embarrassed him on live TV and try to scalp his talent the Rivalry was on East Coast labels rallied around Puff Daddy and Biggie Smalls while Suge Knight roused support among his own colleagues in the LA area Tupac finally formally signed with Death Row Records in October 1995 it was hard at the time to say how much of the feud was real and how much was just branding the medial love to report on the tensions between Biggie and Puff Daddy versus Tupac and Suge Knight Tupac drop several tracks in which he mocked Notorious BIG while it seemed like that was the end of it but in late 1995 one of knights Associates was shot to death in Atlanta not publicly suggested that Puff Daddy had ordered the hit the rivalry at turn deadly but it couldn't get in the way of business nor was night going to allow it to stop him from enjoying the perks of his Fame and Fortune on September 7th 1996 9th and Tupac took a road trip to Las Vegas together to watch a Mike Tyson boxing match for a while according to rumors Tupac plan to leave Death Row Records to found his own label he was one of the biggest names in hip-hop and thought he could leverage his Fame to build an Empire he resented the Tupac would leave him even worse he didn't want to be in direct competition with the accomplished rapper so he hope to convince Tupac to change his mind or at least to ensure that there would be no bad blood between them on the evening of September 7th Knight and Tupac went to the MGM Grand Casino and Hotel on the Strip while they were there they played a few hands of blackjack before they watch Tysons brief match after the fight night and Tupac wear on their way out when they spotted Orlando baby Lane Anderson a known member of the Crips since night was a lifelong blood he immediately tensed Tupac had a score to settle with Orlando to the dates on clear but it's some point earlier Orlando and several other Crips had robbed Tupac intimidating him into handing over a medallion that had personal value to the rapper even aggressive that night at the MGM he was still Tupac and knights enemy for Life Knight and Tupac jump the man with just one punch Tupac laid his rival out on ground but he didn't stop he punched and kicked seemingly unwilling to stop until the Crypt was dead Suge Knight intervened pulling Tupac out of The Fray and escorting him from the MGM they left a beaten but very much alive Anderson behind night was no stranger to Bloodshed but he knew that beat downs had to be executed with Precision he had nothing to gain if his star rapper went to prison for such a senseless crime and then there was the matter of nights prior assault charges he was still on parole and didn't want Tupac stemper to land him in prison at casinos were filled with security cameras he was confident that so long as they escaped the MGM there'd be no further consequences for the Beatdown the police would have no reason to review the footage with no report and as much as night hated the Crips he knew they weren't snitches in Tupac we're cruising down the strip their concerns about the earlier fight behind them Suge Knight slowed to a stop at a red light near the intersection with Koval Lane while the men waited for the signal to change neither made particular note of the white Cadillac that pulled up beside them the Cadillac roll down its back window and night spotted a gun poking out the driver side back seat between 10 and 15 bullets rip through the BMW Tupac was in the passenger seat closer to the shooters he scrambled for the relative safety of the backseat Tupac was hit four times in the chest and torso as for Suge Knight he's suffered only superficial wounds including a graze to his head he gasped for breath processing what he just witnessed as the Cadillac filled out and disappeared down Koval Lane up next night loses a friend and his brutal reign of terror continues on September 7th 1996 thirty-one-year-old Suge Knight visited Las Vegas with 25 year old rapper Tupac Shakur that night unidentified assailants fired in tonight's car striking both men halfway between the front passenger seat in the back seat he was bleeding struggling for breath but still alive and conscious should night rather than calling for an ambulance made an illegal U-turn and tore the wrong way down the strip two police officers pursued them in minutes they pulled night over and found the bloody scene inside the car Suge Knight's in Tupac's blood mingled on the BMW seats while the rapper grew less coherent with each second in an ambulance and then rushed into an emergency operation doctors repaired his most immediate injuries but they couldn't mitigate the damage the bullets had brought little more than a week after the shooting Tupac Shakur died in the hospital at 4:04 p.m. on September 13th 1996 when police questioned night about Tupac's death he refused to cooperate after a lifetime opposed to snitching he wasn't going to turn around and help an investigation even when he was the sole witness even when it involves his friend and colleagues murder theories range suggesting that Notorious BIG killed Tupac due to the East Coast West Coast rivalry or that the victim of his MGM Beatdown Orlando Anderson so deadly Vengeance one popular theory is that Suge Knight himself ordered the hit on Tupac after learning about his plans to open his own label he couldn't stand to lose the client nor would he tolerate arrival manager opening yet another West Coast label so he eliminated the competition it's clear that his actions led to Tupac's death if only indirectly whether he ignited the Rivalry that turned deadly or stood by is Tupac made a lethal enemy in Orlando Anderson night set in motion the series of events that led to the murder when police investigated Tupac's murder they found the security footage that showed Tupac and night beating Orlando Anderson further digging revealed that night was on Parole at the time of the fight these two violations were enough to net him a 9 year prison sentence big was murdered on March 9th 1997 many speculated that night order the hit in retribution for Tupac's death however no charges were ever brought against night today Notorious BIG homicide remains unsolved night only ended up serving four years of his sentence unfortunately in the meantime Death Row Records shed Talent without his guidance Snoop Dogg and dr. Dre it went to rival labels and when night was released on August 6th 2001 he found that the Hip Hop industry had changed by the early 2000s rap was mainstream the coast had lost their hold on the hip-hop scene and Atlanta and New Orleans were Rising as new hubs violent criminality was no longer a selling point it was a liability shed night knew that if he wanted to preserve his legacy he'd have to change his image he kept his head down try to avoid stirring up trouble but while his Public Image was that of a peaceful law-abiding citizen he maintained his cruel streak behind closed doors in 2014 director F Gary gray began production on the feature film Straight Out of Compton a biopic about the rise of NWA rap group that achieved prominence during nights rain in fact Death Row Records co-founder dr. Dre had a conflict with NWA in the mid-80s which night resolved through his tip go threats and violence night himself was depicted in the movie played by R Marcos Taylor in the film for night image was everything and reputation was worth killing over beginning in August gray began receiving texts from 49 year-old Suge Knight reading I will see you in prison you have kids just like me so let's play hardball and I'm a blood criminal street gang member from the city of Compton time has arrived soon afterward gray called the police and appeared before a grand jury for indictment when gray was called to testify however his story had changed when asked about the text messages gray claimed that he couldn't recall ever speaking with Suge Knight Straight Outta Compton and gray claimed that he couldn't even remember the plot of the film he directed it was clear that gray had been intimidated into silence but without a Cooperative witness the courts couldn't take any action against night but that wasn't the end of his violent conflict with f Gary gray or if his frustrations with the Straight Outta Compton movie on January 29th 2015 49 year-old Suge Knight try to strong-arm his way onto a closed set to confront gray before he could disturb the shoot security intervened and saw the confrontation eager to avoid a scene that might create bad press the offer to speak to Suge Knight man-to-man away from the production shed night agreed and the two decided to reconvene at the nearby Tams Burgers shortly thereafter night in a bodyguard pulled into the restaurants parking lot Carter brought a bodyguard to Cle bone Sloan who is working Security on set that day well night remained inside his idling vehicle Carter and Sloan approach the truck night rolled down his window and argued with the men from inside that warning night through his truck into reverse and backed up Sloan was standing so close he was struck by the vehicle he fell to the ground but night wasn't done he charged forward knocking Carter down and running over both men after he crushed both their bodies he peeled out and drove away multiple Witnesses saw the crime and called the police it took only a matter of hours for police to access the security camera footage and learn that Suge Knight intentionally ran the two men over 11 hours after the deadly Collision Suge Knight turned himself in attempted murder charge in September 2018 so he been in and out of court rooms for much of his music career the stakes were particularly high this time for 53 year-old night California was a three-strike state and he had already been convicted twice before for pistol-whipping rappers in 1992 and for parole violations in 1996 that meant that if he were convicted the maximum sentence would be significantly longer than it would be for a first or second offense night could easily spend the rest of his life Behind Bars worst of all prosecuting attorney's played security footage of Carter's death during the trial that meant it would be impossible for night to Clay he hadn't driven his car over Carter or that the incident had been an accident nevertheless night maintained his innocence when he took the stand he laid out his side of the story he explained that Carter was accompanied by a massive Entourage who were standing just out of frame on the video footage was threatened him with loaded guns he claimed that he was terrified of being shot and needed to make a speedy getaway he'd only run over Carter and Sloan because he saw no other path of Escape if nights claims of self-defense were true he had no concrete evidence to back them up the security camera footage from Tams Burgers show no indication that any armed men were present besides Suge Knight and his bodyguard September 2018 he accepted a plea deal in exchange for a no-contest plea to voluntary manslaughter the state would drop their murder charge until his sentence for manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon was 28 years Suge Knight is currently in prison with 27 years remaining on his sentence still be eligible for parole in October 2037 when he's 72 years old as a child Suge Knight learned that any hint of weakness was deadly instead he survived by making himself the baddest toughest scariest man and, by carrying that brutal mentality into adulthood night made the rap industry exactly the kind of dangerous deadly environment that's so shaped and scarred his Youth and by perpetuating his violent ideals he ensured that others from Tupac Shakur to Terry Carter paid the ultimate price for his brutality violent criminality Suge Knight may never have achieved the level of Fame and notoriety that he did with Death Row Records he certainly never would have earned his reputation as an authentic gangster or perhaps Suge Knight may have taken the opportunity to shape an industry and provide talented rappers with an alternative to intimidation beatings prisons dances and death threats instead Suge Knight allowed his Darkside to consume him and many of his closest friends and artists were dragged down as well thanks for listening to the dark side of next week will be back to explore the Dark Side of
