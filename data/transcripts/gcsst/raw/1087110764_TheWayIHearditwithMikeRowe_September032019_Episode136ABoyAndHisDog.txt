Hey there it's micro this is the way I heard it the only podcast for the Curious mind with a short attention span I know I know it's been awhile it's been a long time since I've said those words because it has been over 3 months in fact but happy to say at long last the Hiatus is over I've been busy writing new stories I've got a couple of dozen in the in the hopper as it were and I'll be sharing them three or four times a month over the next four or five months maybe longer if I can write some more as we go who knows maybe we can keep this thing up and running for the next year but it has gotten entirely out of hand I'm happy to say as many of you know part of why I had to take the Hiatus was not just to write news stories but to write a book called the way I heard it which I have committed to do in a fit of pique some months earlier and have finally finished I'm very excited about it I'll be flogging it mercilessly over the next few months apologies in advance for that but wait there's more now there's a show a TV show it looks like although I'm not sure where it's going to are yet but it is called the way I heard it and it looks terrific and I've been filming that down in Atlanta for the last couple of months so it's been a busy time and during the Hiatus a couple of interesting things happened one of which is the audience for this little podcast continue to grow and we eclipsed a hundred million downloads so we are still the what you call the most popular short form podcast in the country anyway because what started as a very modest way to pass the time a little storytelling exercise has turned into a book and a TV show and a podcast with over a hundred million downloads and it certainly would have happened without you so thanks for that thanks for your patience this is episode 136 it's called a boy and his dog I wrote it on national dog day just a week ago but I want to share it first of all because I like it because my dog Freddy is sitting here right now looking at me giving me the stink-eye waiting for his walk I also want to thank ZipRecruiter who is sponsoring not only this episode but the entire month of September don't know where we'd be without ZipRecruiter they were one of the first sponsors here and they've just been terrific not only are they the smartest way to hire for anybody looking to fill a position but they really transformed my Foundation by together for me a job board filled with skilled trades positions over on micro works.com so grateful for that but regardless of the kind of job you looking for or the kind of position that you're trying to fill you know that hiring is challenged ZipRecruiter wrote the book on making it easier ziprecruiter.com never mind the specifics of how they do it the matching technology and all the mumbo-jumbo the bottom line is four out of five people who go to ziprecruiter.com ro and post a job get a quality candidate through the site within the first day I say this not merely as a guy who's grateful for their sponsorship but as a satisfied customer whose use them for over three years now give him a try ziprecruiter.com row great to be back this is episode 136 it's called a boy and his dog and it is the way I heard it little Jimmy drove a hard bargain the fact that no one in Hollywood would ever deny for instance when he saw the dog tied to a post outside the liquor store underneath the sign that read $100 is first thought wasn't jate I really want that dog his first thought was how little can I pay for it sitting next to the big dog was a skinny kid in his mid-twenties who look like you've been crying nice dog that little Jimmy what kind is it he's a bullmastiff said the skinny kid he's the best dog in the whole world then why is selling it cuz I can't afford to feed him said the skinny kid hell I can't afford to feed myself little Jimmy had heard many hard luck stories from naive kids who thought they could show up in Hollywood and get famous overnight he been one of those kids himself and learn the hard way the dreams didn't pay the rent you had to drive a hard bargain especially if you were only four feet tall trying to scratch out a living in an oversized world you an actor as little Jimmy sort of said the skinny kid mostly I'm a writer at least I'm trying to be Jimmy turn his attention to the enormous dog at 140 lb it was bigger than he was is he friendly of course he's friendly said the skinny kid I told you he's the best dog in the world the dog out for a little Jimmy a massive Paul which Jimmy shook will look at that said little Jimmy I think he likes me he likes everybody said the skinny kid little Jimmy looked up at the kid 510 dark are baggy pants dirty tank top tennis shoes falling apart around his feet it was his expression though that told little Jimmy all he needed to know the droopy hangdog face of a man so far down on his luck he had to sell his best friend the face of a man would take a lot less than $100 I'll give you twenty-five bucks said little Jimmy the kids face drooped even further the very picture of Despair my wife and I are hungry mr. please we need every penny we can get the big dog leaned over and licked little Jimmy with a tongue the size of a rolled-up newspaper I'll give you 40 said little Jimmy but not a penny more the skinny kid side and took two twenties just as little Jimmy knew he would and stuff them into the front pocket of his baggy pants then he knelt down and kissed his dog on the muzzle I'm sorry boy I got no choice then he looked at Little Jimmy treat him good mr. he really is the best dog in the world with that the skinny kid with a hangdog face brushed away tear and watched little Jimmy walk off with his best friend hoping the little man would take care of the big dog bark course it didn't two weeks later little Jimmy sold the dog to a buyer who made him an offer he couldn't refuse the buyer had started a $200 but little Jimmy's suspected the man making this unsolicited offer would pay more I love this dog said little Jimmy my kids love him they be heartbroken if I sold him to illustrate the point little Jimmy summoned his kids from the house who did indeed weep at the prospect of losing their new pet the offer went from 200 to 400 then 600 than a thousand but little Jimmy held firm when the haggling finally stopped the buyer agreed to pay little Jimmy $15,000 for the dog a staggering amount back in 1976 but wasn't the only thing little Jimmy demanded along with the cash he wanted a speaking role in the movie the movie that was written in less than 4 days and sold to the studio for $35,000 more than enough money for the skinny kid with a hangdog face to repurchase his best friend and so we did the aspiring writer who sold his dog for 40 bucks had valid on that sad day to buy him back whatever it took so we wrote a screenplay as fast as he could a screenplay the turned into a movie in which little Jimmy was given a cameo maybe you remember the scene at the conclusion of the main event little Jimmy turns to the main character and says hey did you win the main character replies what are you deaf at which point little Jimmy barely visible in a crowd of full grown adult says no I'm just short maybe you don't recall that completely forgettable exchange between an anonymous dwarf named little Jimmy and the star of the movie maybe you don't recall the 140 lb bull mastiff named Butkus who also appeared in that very same movie but I bet you remember the movie itself the movie that was written in less than 4 days by the skinny kid desperate to repurchase the dog he couldn't afford to feed the same skinny kid who put on a few pounds in order to play the lead character in the first movie he wrote and starred in the best picture of 1976 a film about an underdog called Rocky written by another Underdog who missed his best friend Sylvester Stallone it's the way I heard it can a great guy sold his dog and then bought it back a couple thoughts on that story I did write it on national dog day that's the truth but it wasn't the story that I thought I was going to rain I wanted to do something on Stallone and I read somewhere that the the droopy part of his face you know that snarl he's always had was was the result of a forceps being mishandled during his delivery which was apparently a difficult one two sets of forceps were employed and one of them squeeze too hard severed a nerve in his face and ever since I'll Sylvester Stallone had that kind of Droopy thing going on with his face so I wanted to write a story about the nurse or the doctor or whoever was responsible for giving him that expression that ultimately helped him Prosper but the more I write about the more I realize that story been out there for a long time and a lot of different ways and then I stumbled across this sort of side note that made me take a deeper dive into the story about his dog and as with most of these you know it's impossible to know exactly how things went down and there's always so much contradictory or conflicting information out there on the interwebs but I did find a couple of different quotes from Stallone who was interviewed about this very thing and a full disclosure there is some discrepancy not about whether or not the the transaction happened but how much he actually paid early on when he tells the story he's quoted as saying he bought Butkus back for $3,000 and then later it's $15,000 so I don't I don't know which is true but 15 is a better story and as long as he's the one saying it well that's the one I'm going with Shelby stories work by the way that's why I call it the way I heard it and that's why the book that's currently available is also called the way I heard it these are true wish stories and the book by the way at micro. Com book you can pre-order a copy right now it contains 35 stories from the podcast and fans of the podcast full of heard of the stories before in all likelihood but they're interspersed with 35 stories from my from my past so it's part Memoir and part mystery and if you're into that kind of thing but this is the book for you at micro.com book go ahead and pre-order copy today and you'll have my eternal gratitude till then till then what do you mean I don't mean till then I was going to say till then I'll see you next week but that made it sound like till then like unless you buy a book on them never going to talk to you again and of course I don't mean that I'll be back next week but here by Booker or whether you like it or not cuz that's the way I heard it this is an update episode of the teacher's pet.
