Of time according to where those lines are the suburbs are the federal courts had no right to Cross or change our school district lines or divorce kids into or out of our schools unless they can prove that we're responsible for Detroit segregation problem a 5-4 court agreed of the five justices in that majority for had been appointed by President Nixon in the end the suburbs were held blameless and their schools off-limits Detroit was told to somehow desegregate itself and unrealistic demand said the courts only African-American Justice Detroit only plan simply has no hope of achieving actual desegregation Justice Thurgood Marshall offered this descent and white and negro students will not go to school together instead of negro children will continue that $10 gross go you're very evil that Brian was aimed at will not picture I do bubble be perpetuated Marshall new because schools are funded through local property taxes that desegregated big city districts weren't you separate but clearly on equal justice Marshall warned this should worry everyone as superficial as those relied on by the majority opinion today we do I need to return to reach their full potential citizen is there a grown up I need to know if there will be ossur by this Court's refusal to remedy separate and unequal education or unless our children begin to learn together there is little hope that I will ever learn to live together and understand each other desegregation is not and was never expected to be an easy task racial attitudes in the middle of the year cannot be allowed to stand in the Way of the Fist show public opposition no matter how striking cannot be permitted to divert piscart from the enforcement of the constitutional principles at issue in this case today is only in my view is more a reflection of a perceived public mood that we have gone fine and forth in the Constitutional guarantee of equal justice then there's the Prada neutral principles of law the short run the name seemed to be the easier cause to allow metropolitan areas to be divided up into two cities one wife the other black but his cars are predicting how people will ultimately regret and for these reasons I respectfully dissent nearly half a century after Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote that opinion US schools are still incredibly segregated and people like Rebecca cebelia from Ed build a nonprofit that studies public school funding points straight to Milliken 1 and 5 students are going to school in districts that could easily be desegregated by crossing a School District border and the federal government has taken themselves out of the game in terms of being able to provide that solution after the break even more on milliken's effect on public school integration where was the school they mirror the residential segregation cuz we're headed to Long Island stay with us support for NPR in the following message come from rothys rothys are the everyday flats for life on the go stylish versatile fully machine washable and they go with everything from yoga pants to dresses and skirts best of all their 0 braking.

over Latin America and across the u.s. we kick things off with a voice that some of you may have heard the rise and fall of one of Latin America's most famous voice-over artist in the industry that crumbled around him but I've learned it from NPR listen And subscribe now stream stream code switch in 1974 the Supreme Court ruled in the Milliken V Bradley case that the federal government could mandate desegregation across School District borders so you can desegregate schools within the same school district but not across School District confusing I know that's why we've invited Alyssa nadworny from NPR said Team to talk more about what that means and how it's still affecting Public Schools all these years later hey Alyssa hey sharine explain to me why desegregation efforts within Public School borders but not across Public School borders doesn't actually help integrate Public Schools so first we have to start with housing so if you think about where people live that's going to dictate what schools they go to where they send their kids and so we have a system in the US in which we have historically put certain groups of people mostly divided by race in certain pockets and so when the school district lines are drawn around where people live you got to Visions yes hashtag housing segregation and everything seriously yeah I mean like you see it today and how people buy houses and how they pick where they live it's based from the school district so it's kind of this you know continually cyclical thing and so what I'm hearing from you is it makes no sense to desegregate within a district that is concentrated either with only people of color are only white people because of the way these lines were drawn yeah absolutely the Milliken case in the seventies as Cory explain kind of Detroit which is predominantly African-American they're saying hey like we don't actually have enough other raced children to actually enter radar schools like we have to look across district lines in order to make this happen and it is all over the country knowing this have we move the needle then on public school segregation post Brown be bored so that's kind of a tricky question because short and some places we had we actually see it a lot more in the south in the South the school district lines are for the county so it's kind of like a metropolitan area so it's a city and maybe some suburb some rural areas when the school district lines are broad enough that you can have proper integration with in the school district have seen a lot of integration efforts I mean we are nowhere near where we should be I think research has shown that could we peeked in like the seventies and eighties and we just gone downhill since then but but that said today let's just take blackson's living in say Mississippi there are more black students in Mississippi today we're going to school with white children then there were Brown V board time so in that sense yes we've definitely move the needle on certain places so one of the ways that we can kind of see where it's working and where it's not work is because of organization call Dad built some of their this nonprofit that investigates school funding and equities and how race plays into certain districts they looked at districts that neighbor each other so District right up against each other so you can have a kid from living right across the street from another kid and they go to different school districts that line has to be somewhere and they were looking especially a trace of the racial makeup of the student body and how much funding each district got sober pupil funding is kind of the metric we use and that's how much money does the school have to spend on each kid so they look at these two factors and they wanted to narrow in two borders neighbors that differed a lot of both of those factors so it's not just segregation it's also resources and what do they find they identified about a thousand school districts that differed substantially by their racial makeup of the students and by how much money they were getting per student per year so on the non-white side those school districts we're getting about $4,000 less per student per year than their wealthier wider neighbors and how is that affecting the kids especially the kids on the side that are getting $4,000 last I talked to Rebecca civilian who's the founder and CEO of adult about this and she pointed to the fact that 9 million children's that's nearly one-in-five public school students in the US than 10 schools on the disadvantage side of that line so they're racially isolated and they received far less money the kids that sit on the Advantage side of those borders there's only about 2.9 Million of them and so what we understand is that in our country basically for everyone student that has Advantage based on these borders that we've drawn they leave behind three of their neighbors and that is the kind of growing and Equity that we have seen in our society certainly since the 70s and the Supreme Court ruling in Milliken has basically created the School District border as a fundamental tool to further fracture Society B I love what she says there to further fracture Society in reporting this I've heard people refer to school district lines as Weapons or Shields to keep people out and it's amazing could have the power that these lines have had the other interesting thing is that this isn't just a southern issue like I think people when we talk about segregation or unequal schools they think of the South and that's not true often times when we're looking at the impact of school district lines we find that they impact states that you wouldn't expect much more than they impact the South the states that have relied on school district lines historically and continue to in order to segregate communities are New York New Jersey a California for everyone student in California with advantage in a neighbor pair there are 12 students that are left behind she also mentioned New Jersey and New York there and I am curious how have those districts taken advantage of his Milligan decision to maintain de facto segregation and their states have they yeah so I think the easiest way to Anabella Street this is to talk about how many school districts there are in some of these places take Long Island's for example there are more than a hundred Amy 5 school districts about half a million students so think about that versus like a Los Angeles which serves about the same number of students but is School District 125 school districts on Long Island it's a patchwork I mean you tried 15 minutes and you're in another school district and you drive 15 more minutes and you're in another one did this happen like post Milliken So Long Island is always had a ton of school districts and in many other places even in New York City and across the country over time all the school districts were Consolidated in Long Island there's been a real hesitancy to do that and that's mostly linked with this idea of local control so that's the idea of local money going to Local Schools so one of the things we're seeing post milk can is this idea of breaking away from larger District so this happened around Birmingham Alabama so little sections mostly white trying to secede from the County district and you remember we were talking about the south how many places it was more integrated because the district's follow county line so they're much bigger is more like a metropolitan school district and now we're seeing these pocket these like wealthier white or suburb say actually we don't want to be in the county school district we're going to secede and make her own little school district because of Milliken cuz it's going to protect us from having to share our students and share our money so it's almost like they're taking a nod from places like Long Island where you went I went to Nassau County which is home to several different districts But it includes Garden City Union Free School District and Hempstead Union Free School District so those are kind of long while he titles but essentially their neighboring towns Hempstead and Garden City and they have their own school districts they're right next to each other I'm right in the middle of Long Island so you think about Long Island's kind of like this long stretch out from New York City with water on both sides and temp setting on to your right in the middle. It I wanted to see the lines I wanted to drive the lines between the two school districts I have heard so much about it and so I wanted to see it myself Prophet called Erase racism and she took me driving to see these two communities you know immediately that you've on this one street you've left Garden City and now you're in Hempstead as we're driving these big houses green Lawns country clubs there behind us in Garden City and we're driving towards Hempstead and you can just like the street changes below Dakar it becomes full of potholes not smooth the the houses are closer to the sidewalk the green essentially goes away you know and said he's big houses there now apartment buildings right up against the sidewalk and you just know instantly that you've changed and you're not on Hempstead where was Ibis cool they mirror control segregation exactly what we've been talking about and what Ed build found the school's reflect this housing segregation the racial makeup of these two neighboring town you know 15 minutes from each other that if you look at Hempstead public schools there 2% white Garden City Schools 87% so 15 minutes away and it's drastically different racially so you don't know anything that's worth mentioning is the difference in funding here so again it's not just racially segregated it's at the students in Hempstead are getting about $5,000 less a year than the students in Garden City so I saw this kind of firsthand just being in both of the district high schools you see this just in the actual quality of the buildings but it's also evident in the number of computers they have and textbooks and what their Library looks like I mean there's differences in come the classes that they offer you the other thing website called donors choose which is where teachers can put up a fundraising initiatives for their school so this is where they would put a project or they would ask for money for something that they're working on in the school year and we looked at Hempstead and Garden City and you can see differences and what the teachers request mean in Garden City it's things like money for field trips or for the robotics lab in Hempstead teachers are asking for more basic needs food clothing things for their students and you see the difference in the houses as we could have drove around and lean was giving me the history of this place you know it's a used to be all potato Fields out here I don't know if you've been to Long Island recently I have never been to Long Island how about that houses houses houses houses houses I mean in this is essentially like what we think of as Suburbia Elaine brought me to this park and it's right on the edge of Hempstead it's in Garden City but it's right on the line and it's a really beautiful Park it's lush green new swings and this park for Elaine it represents this clear division between the two communities because it is a park that is clearly for just the folks in Garden City this area this area for used by Garden City residents only what is the public park but it's a public park for people who who live in Garden City wow so this is what we're dealing with and it's right in your face in a way that I think in a lot of places it's a little bit more hidden so as we drive and we're kind of seeing this literally outside our window Elaine is talking about that history the intention was to permanently keep blacks out because the Deeds had racial covenants saying that the owners those white owners the original owners could not resell to someone who was not Caucasian and so certainly the intention was to Forever keep out black people talk about a structural impediments you can't get any more obvious than that there are legacies even today I mean you think about kind of where people live and why Garden City has almost no Thai family housing right it's all single family homes exactly and just in that little detail like you know if you want to rent or you're living with other family members or your recent immigrant like you're going to live in Hempstead on Garden City what about the students who go to these very different schools who can't I play in a in a public park together they notice said of course they notice it this is the thing that they live it takes a lot to change the way people think that's so she was a high school student last year so she's a senior and she graduated and I met with her on one of the luck stays at the school year at Hempstead High School today AP Literature AP biology Spanish and AP Statistics and then I have banned wow her you know a high school student heading off to Yale are there so she went to accept it didn't stay at Yale and she got to talking with other students who would be starting in the fall freshman like her and it was there that she kind of realized that like they have more resources that they had at their school so kind of finding a way to kind of catch up to them that's so interesting to me that she had to go all the way to Yale to talk to other students to realize that the students had more resources than she did when 15 minutes away there's a school that is so completely different from the school that she was attending went there should never gone to a sporting event or over to their campuses she's ever seen Garden City students over at Hempstead either they see what time's it is on the news or like in the newspaper but they don't actually interact with him students to see that all we might be thinking the same way and we might do the same things it was really interesting to talk with her because I think she wants that she wants to Foster friendship across districts and that's exactly the point that Thurgood Marshall was trying to make it his descent 45 years ago and to that point thinking about the Supreme Court I can't help it think that there's nothing anyone can do to rectify this problem outside of taking it another case all the way up to the Supreme Court that will somehow make this Millikin ruling no longer have any teeth the courts issue like the role of the courts they have been kind of this powerful thing and making change and I asked Rebecca about this and she says courts are still an option even even state courts Milliken V Bradley was a lawsuit that was brought by one woman who was representing the children that she had enrolled in her Public Schools any person out there can become a plaintiff in a lawsuit that soon as the state to say will no longer take this kind of unequal treatment there are very tangible things that parents and teachers and community members can be doing in order to raise pressure to change the system I hear that but I also feel like if that's the case then why do we still have this problem of a de facto segregation in our public schools in the United States who are State legislatures and what do they care about and that's kind of where a lot of this potentially could change those are the folks who are deciding where District borders are and how we fund schools and and Rebecca talked about this a little bit about how parents and Community organizations they can put pressure on these folks to that are making the decisions I mean you have to wait a decade to change where these districts are drawn they could be changed the next legislative cycle if we wanted to but the reality is this is really hard there's a reason why this case I've been in 1970 for 45 years ago and things haven't really moved clearly history has shown us that it's an uphill battle but I think you know there is a little bit of Hope and hopefully after people listen to this podcast. See these borders although they're invisible they're not they're actually quite visible and maybe it'll Open the Eyes of some of our listeners to wear these borders exist and where there's these very Stark differences between School District how kids education's are funded yeah I think that's actually right well thanks Alyssa thank you I listen I don't need covers education for NPR's at team batard show please follow us on Twitter we're at NPR code switch and we want to hear from you or email is code switch at NPR.
