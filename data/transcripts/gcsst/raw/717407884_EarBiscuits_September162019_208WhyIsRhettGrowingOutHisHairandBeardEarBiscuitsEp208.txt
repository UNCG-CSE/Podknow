grandma welcome to ear biscuits I'm link and I met this week at the round table of dim lighting we are exploring the question why am I Rhett growing out my hair and beard why are you growing out your hair and beard hair and beard you're growing out your hair and beard hair and beard dye my hair and beard navigate to everything it would be a beard shaped like a heron which is a bird and it seems like there's a beak it could be from a okay I'm listening I'm on board for this just cut your hair you cut yourself short mean your hair is okay I'm on board cheese with I'm on board but they may not be so what what is it you mean like my hair there's something to this since so apparently there's enough to talk about I don't I mean this may be an announcement to you but yes the plan is grow my hair in my beard out and I have a reason I knew you were going to do it is not news but the specifics it may not seem like the kind of thing that warrants a conversation on your biscuits but yeah I think we've demonstrated that it doesn't take much to warn a conversation is there something to this like it's just going to go somewhere this conversation like I've certainly hope so for the sake of the entertainment of the you're not really like I'm looking for a teaser like yes and what I'm really going to talk I have a deeply personal reason that I'm doing it and I already how's that for a tease you have a deep so it is not a shallow thing there's a deep out there could be shallow element stewardess we will explore all that okay alright but it started in a deeply personal place all right I hereby commit to be actively engaged in ripping you just read but also supporting you emotionally okay that's interested okay before we get into your hair and beard I can't figure out if this is something to celebrate because it might come across as bragging and I'm trying to figure out how I want bragging that he wishes but I got a new car and this is not a normal thing for you long time, yeah I like I've been driving this Scion xB that we bought together how many years ago you've been through a number of cards and I've just been driving the Scion xB when we first just a step back a little bit when we when it was when we first moved to LA we we told my family minivan behind U-Haul truck and then you you took over the lease when somebody in Santa Monica the fun fact life tip I didn't know this was a thing but if you need a car for a short. Of time and I needed a car for 6 months because we were saying we were we're going to be here for six months and furnished apartments right we didn't move all of our stuff you can actually get the car back in North Carolina I guess I did two of them you can take over someone else's lease and there are different websites where you can do it so it's much cheaper than renting a car you don't want to rent a car for 6 months and if you're in a situation like I wasn't couldn't borrow a car cuz I was going to a new place where I didn't know anybody only time I've drove a Saturn in in Saturn just quit making cars went with you to pick it up Culver City so that I drove you there cuz Uber wasn't really popping yet that wasn't Culver City with all the way you was at the beach almost it was like Cerritos something like a biker something you like me to go to the part when you buy it but for you it was taking over the lease of a car it's not a little but I don't know if I actually took it over I just got the keys and drove away but you was paper working and cash involved yeah but it was all the paperwork was with the bank and then our second car when you when we settled into living here think we least a Ford Fusion Ford Fusion with as a company car which I drove and then I would I will come to your house because we worked in your backyard between the two fan of a car between the two families we had three cars total so I had a minivan we had an SUV and that was what Jesse and Chrissy drove because they needed to take the children out a good while and then we bought speaking of cash we bought the Scion because that's the car that you had back in North Carolina and you liked it cuz it was it was it had storage capacity and it was it works already called her a tall person so you could sit ups still the best cars for a tall person idea to buy it in cash like we had this vision of taking out the cash well I think that when people said you buy a car in cash we literally saw that meant that you took a stack of cash into the dealership and it just really means you just don't find it to get a cashier's check we literally took a stack I'm sure which all this story dollars okay and we put $18,000 in an envelope and water rights going to be in my pocket and you were just thought I was excited that is not that much money if you get $1,000 bill exist but I've never seen one we got hundreds I got eighteen now we got a hundred and $800 bills for that and then we like gave it to the guy and he liked looked at it's kind of weird cuz it's still like it's like one Stacker it's what I mean is what rappers talk about doing they got bands I want to do it more often he had to take the money and put it in a counter to twice a lot of cash so I've been driving that thing around for years the but I backed into somebody in a Ralphs parking lot in the bumpers all crapped out what's hail like busted will tell the tale has been busted for over a year I just been driving it you know I mean it. Bluetooth connectivity to my phone I can listen to music all you need Bluetooth although I read recently you should turn your Bluetooth off because it is highly susceptible to having security breaches you should turn your airdrop for just turn your Bluetooth off unless you are currently connecting to something that requires Bluetooth don't have it on all the time because people be opening up that mouth and taking advantage of your Bluetooth a really blue teeth yeah drive your car so I finally did it I got a new car and I I've had him I'm I want to get an electric vehicle course and I'm like you know what this is this is my opportunity to splurge you know but this is the first time I've like this is like a this is the quintessential splurge on myself that's what I've done cuz you use a different kind of electric car I test drove a Tesla and then I looked at the price tag on that thing and I just could not bring myself to do it especially when you were looking at that was Acts which is just a mean one brand new so that like if the whole family need to go somewhere we can still all technically get in it sound like okay really that's a requirement I think I do think that that's kind of important she talked me into that cuz I test drove a BMW the I3 it's like that it kind of looks like a bigger bigger Burger bigger version of a smart car is the one that Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel were in the commercial making fun of themselves from talking about the internet that campaign and the reason was to keep it lighter so I can have a greater range and they're still trying to sell you on and you put a little a little gas engine in the back as a backup am I for some reason as anxious as I get about things I wanted to fully commit to an electric car I mean we also have a gas powered off we go on like a trip or camping or something so it's like I don't have what they call range anxiety what you have all of the types of things that would you have the car for a week and you don't know what kind of things out of your going to most people have it and it keeps them from considering a fully electric vehicle range anxiety is when you're in the car and you start looking at the meter but yes but it starts with deciding if you're going to this is all right I think I have that I looked at the Audi e-tron you got to sign up for like a waiting list for like months and months and months to get this fixed so they kind of trick me into full splurged because you go on and you you configure your car and you like you place an order and they're like well you can change this before we we get it goes to the plant to be made and some like you know what I'm going all the way and I said yes to everything I've never went back onto the screen what's happening are we might call that the website I call it the screen and like really so you know what I'm not going to get this because it cost a little more and I'm not going to get this Edition is like the first time I've ever said yes to everything all the accessories for anyting like I'm I'm usually the one that's like yeah I'll get it but you know I'm not going to get this in this Miss next email I got they were shipping that thing and I was like too late now I talked my I backed into the splurge and again I just feel like I'm I'm I'm almost apologizing but it's like because that I just have a hard time spending money so I got this thing or are you apologizing for the massaging seats I was in your what Your she gave me a massage I don't know if you could tell by the look on my face but I requested one but I put pressing the buttons and I got one the other day when I was like six different types of massages yet she went up to the Salt shoulders I don't know why I just said she did the seat and deceit went up to the shoulders lower back mid back and then I put on the event Elation in your nice leather perforated seats you do the bragging formula yesterday cuz I I usually come the one to take him to school Christy takes Lillian Lincoln the high school Bolton High School in a little bit earlier and he all he got around and got in the front seat is I'm getting in the front seat and I was I look at him weird because like he insist on me chauffeuring him to school like he would always get in the backseat of the Scion he would never get in the front seat with me really most kids as soon as they have the opportunity to Cedar up there and I was like and I don't exactly know why my theory was when he got out of the front seat I'm more visible and if any of the other students can see it's me he's like self-conscious about his dad being recognized at that guy from the internet he has an hour I told me that but I think that was part of it like he wants to slip out of the back and put them in the trunk back into school in the front seat cuz he's in fourth grade now so maybe he's over the whole dad's famous they like he's realized it's not who cares but what do you really do was he wanted that massager I'm like yeah okay here's another bit my son is not riding beside me on the way to school I can actually look at him a little bit when we were we were driving it and he's so relaxed when he gets there yeah he's just he's just like to wake him up somewhere at school but I'll tell you this thing's got so much stuff so many cameras so many blessings and blast and whistles and alerts and screens that I don't know where to look I mean you were backing up the other day and I actually saw one view was just a colonoscopy of myself that it's actually need to see a doctor it's a colon cleanse it's a colonic it's not doctor certified it's more just like woo science what kind of but it drains directly onto the streets are not like I have to clean it up. I mean I don't know if you noticed but I'm we're going to this I'm driving well first of all I'm offering to drive now yeah and then cuz I feel like I feel like I'm just driving for free just I feel like I'm I never go to a gas station a sure I plug it into that thing when I get home but I just feel like it's free fuel now the sticker on the car said you save like $2,500 over 5 years in fuel cost I'm like man that's that's depressing Lilo well because you know the ironic thing is that the fuel that you're using at home electricity that you're using a home is most likely generated by fossil fuels but that is not a reason to not transition to an electric car in it for the Long Haul yeah so I mean there's a zero-emissions is better yes it's the right thing to do but it is an expensive thing to do at this point and you can't really do it to save money but it's also about Driving Experience let me tell you man I told Christopher we are driving in the future it just feel that way it's like I've never been in a car that had acceleration accelerating for the first time in a car just in this exhilarating to accelerate but let me tell you with so much to look at listen to and be distracted by I'm putting myself passengers and everyone around me are some close calls you ran two red lights yesterday. Just yesterday I love lights also takes you I'm looking at other thing it already takes you a long time to get in and go begin going cuz there's lots of things that happen and then takes a long time to get out of the car he's been taking you I take an extra 45 seconds on top of your already like 120 second Route 10 I don't even know where the how to start it yet yeah running red lights if I get it started I mean like I almost hit a pedestrian and here's the thing it's so quiet you know they add a little sound of a little sad that they as a futuristic sound first time it was like play that's the sound that is not necessary for the operation of vehicle that is a that is added for safety and only and coolness and in Reverse it makes a sound I never bet I've never heard it from the outside drive it I'll drive it around you I'll drive a circle around you can stand outside and listen to it okay that's about as far as I'll let you go I have to let Lily drive it I was pretty nervous about that but Christy is not driven it so yeah but you're going to let her feel guilty about about doing it but I'm also having the time of my life behind the wheel self and I would think Audi but it's not like I got a discount so not a sponsor I mean you did buy it you did order it directly after we attended that Audi dinner that's true I was one of the coolest experiences we've had in are in charge of like the whole like name-dropping kind of situation that we drop those names cuz let's do it Don Cheadle we had dinner and we're very small group of people and drinking Don Cheadle is there that's all I got to say I assume he be nice but he was unexpectedly jovial guy so nice I did you know that the first adjective you would use to describe Don Cheto would be jovial bet I'll most festive and I don't like Chris it feels like Christmas around the guy that very engaged with whatever it is that everyone's talking about Kumail nanjiani sat next to him and we're talkin about the EHR and he was like I don't quit I mean it's basically just a station wagon and I'm like it's not it is so I would have to agree with that it's kind of like it's kind of a practical thing which makes it's not like flashy with like and it's I asked I like the color it's a cool color but it's cool because it's not cool you know you got a tan base station wagon yeah I did you got a base station when it's not really but it looks very futuristic not as much as a Tesla though like it's got a grill even though it doesn't need a grill how many people are driving a Tesla looks like it's not and fully electronic vehicle because of the grill and stuff like that until you get a muffler I'm happy for you know Mufflers that's my favorite part and yeah I mean I got a new car and you get a new hair the side effect of you driving more though is that you don't not great at carrying on a conversation while driving so it makes it look a little bit that's a little bit of a bummer and then I can start talking once I figure out how use that okay if we have any more harrowing or not her own experiences in your car all right I getting more massages what we will keep you updated on that need a massage do you need to be massaged to the car but first we want to let you know that your biscuits is supported by Honey nine times out of ten shopping online beats going to the store I've never experienced the other one out of two at one time and you saw an old friend and you reconnected with the hell does that was bad too but also nine times out of ten you're overpaying when you shop online unless you use honey and he searches the web for coupon codes and discounts and Plies them automatically at checkout I've never save money easier way to get Lando some new shoes we were able to save $11.25 on some kids sneaker footlocker.com Foot Locker footlocker.com $26 per year you can get a new pair of sneakers with that money in that Locker.

told the mythical Society members during one of the the monthly blogs we have like a monthly Vlog over there at the medical society and I said I was good I bet you he said I was thinking about didn't want to fully commit to saying that I was growing my hair in my beard out but haven't talked about it here I did say I would talk about why I like people you know my hair in my beard have a certain cycle and most people have short of recognize like I let my hair or my facial hair grow to this point and then I get it cut probably a lot of dudes are like on a monthly schedule 6 weeks maybe and I just got to the end of one of my cycles and I was like I think I'm going to cut it and your time at the hair at this point cuz the beard you would trim more often in that the beard by wood trim more often but so the other thing that I feel that the thing this thing that coincided with this and when was the motivation for it the primary motivation for it is in giving a little background on this but in serapis are the main thing that I am kind of focusing on style is she is just looking better know is damn we're already talked about Sara moving moving from the head to the heart now okay scientifically speaking what is it really a difference I'm to what I'm talking about is in the principal is an embodiment and yeah we're in La now and we hang around folks who talk about things like embodiment and do things like embodiment workshops yeah you can you can shake your head or what your whatever you do to those kinds of things if you're not into it but I would say that as I hopefully have demonstrated and have talked about just the idea of getting more in touch with my feelings because I tend to be a super heady person and actually if you ask me what I'm feeling about something I will tell you what I'm thinking about in this is a this is a pretty I would say that this is a huge issue I know how to tell you how I feel I just tell you how I think you can lead a horse you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him feel I think Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne had a love child and that's what you just impersonated well that makes me feel criticized so and you know the interesting thing is in this is a thing that I have discovered in in therapy is I will cry very easily Feldman I was at Feldman's wedding this past weekend I cried at your wedding congratulations Falmouth Maine Rec cry cry was it cuz it was it was a just a John Paul Jones for those of you who watch Bachelor paradise it was just a heaving snow it wasn't it wasn't anything like that it was just my eyes welled up with tears I don't believe that it's your dropped but yours either at least I got misty-eyed Merced for Stacy when you get when I thought about what Stacy was going to have to endure for the next few decades we're talkin tears of joy and I will cry easily at a movie I will cry I will cry at an emotional commercial like everyone's mother on the Super Bowl commercials and it's usually like about something like a Dodge truck but it's the whole thing is very like emotional and it doesn't take much to get to get that the Water Works going for me but that actually is not evidence of sensitivity it's actually evidence of my tendency to be because all humans have to have some kind of release of your emotions right now typically for me it's going to come out with crying at things that there are no I have no personal steaks in sorry to say it, and I don't have any personal stakes in your marriage I see your marriage like a commercial that I'm just using passive and so I'm very it doesn't take much to make me start crying at that because you need to let it out somehow my releases I think it might be just clenching my my butthole my butthole yeah you should you should I run into gets here cuz there's not a lot of release associated with clenching but like yeah but that well that's a clenched so there is it released for me I don't know fart I don't know any other release for me is anger by which I would think is the same for you as well you know you're in that situation where your family really hasn't done anything at all that warrants you being pissed but your fuse is pretty short and it's because you got to get your dealing with frustrations at work during xiety about your life or your career whatever for me A lot of times it's just as general level of frustration with the things that were trying to create make better in like creative aspirations being you know restricted in some way are thinking about the future and are we still going to be relevant what are all those things that kind of get rolled up in or maybe just you're just doing a whole lot of things at once the stress comes in and then it's got to find a way out and so a lot of times with me it'll just be an angry outbursts not like physical thing but just like a short uncharitable tone or word with my kids or my wife and I'm dealing with that because a lot cuz the thing that my therapist is trying to get me to do is just be okay when you are experiencing something don't just immediately move to what do you think about it cuz I'm also a huge problem solver and stuff like if you even if somebody tells me an issue that they have emotionally the way I responded that is to tell you what you should do even if you know it's not how to say it cuz you know it's like in your mind are in my mind it's immediate like well if it were me I would do this my next step would be this my action would be this and this is problematic in relationships of Christ so if your wife comes to you and says that this is how I feel about this or I had a bad day in this is specifically what happened you know my typical responses to be like well what we going to do about it here's my advice and what she's not interested in my advice she's interested in me having some empathy and feeling along with her related to that one of the things that I'm trying to do is sort of live more in this part of my body like in so again this is Deezer basically just tools I don't think that I'm live there some like Center of mass of my soul that is literally moving down to my heart but there is just like physical I questioned by where do I feel this thing and like how do I how do I embody this on a more consistent basis so I could be in a situation where I'm just they're acting with somebody and I can be like don't just think about what they're saying and think about this conversation feel what they're saying and feel this conversation and be in your heart and you will be a more connected present person you know we got an advance copy of our friend Mike science Mike mchargue new book which I'm sure we'll talk about more later but I shouldn't talk about his book which he gave us a sneak peek but screw it he said you know he's talking about how you have a nervous system built around your like your digestive system for example nerves aren't just to feel at your fingertips but it's to give feedback if I'm not mistaken light independent of like rational parts of your brain like well I mean a lot of your nervous system it just it works and send signals in your body responds automatically but there's but there's actually there's feeling and sensation associated with these things weather is digestion or there's a sign or reality to obviously I don't understand it or can't explain it as well as my can but knowing that is another access point to I think what you're talkin about which is beginning to awaken to the fact that everything doesn't happen in our rational our experience is not just limited to what we can filter rationally that's what you're saying right yeah and well and also it's if you're like me you can have a tendency to just come to the conclusion that this is my personality my personality is not very emotional like I'm not one of those emotional people there's not a lot of drama in reality I'm just really good and certain circumstances at behaving well but because I'm a human but that stuff that goes in is going to come out in some form like we discussed and for me it's unhealthy ways so all back to say that's one of my Mantra in this is very difficult to remember to do this my Mantra has just to be like being the heart be in the heart you know and where does my hair in my beard is coming to this that is the question but before you answer that I actually what was so if that's your if that's your monster the thing that you repeat yourself a how do you do that in like what is a mantra part mean and then what is it what what what is the specific action point I what do you do to be in the heart well first of all I'm figuring that out now one one thing I do is so first of all are you like repeating over and over again that phrase out loud necessarily is it's more when I find myself in a situation I might how can I be more embodied right now in this conversation in this interaction In This Moment whatever but practically I think I have is in a couple of ways one is asking myself what do I feel about something as opposed to just what do I think about it I think I got enough thinking going off her like a dozen people I'm not about to think not enough about something so it's more like okay but what I can do in this is this closes me off and relationship is to just think about things and so it's like okay what do you feel about that to actually feel it take a moment to let where do you feel it and what is the feeling I mean a lot of time they're possessed me but not know what the what do you what do you how do you feel about that I don't know what I feel about it but I can tell you what I think about it so it's asking that question the second part of it I think for me a big part of some kind of being present in like a conversation is not an especially in a cut in in a group maybe not necessarily A large group but where I tend to go into my performance mode in this gets into a little bit of the which we saw banana podcast on this two Enneagram stuff which is essentially just a way to think about your personality it's not particularly scientific but it's not like astrology it's not it's it's just based on observation and I tend to be a performer and so I kind of adapt to certain environment so I was like okay I'm in this type of environment with these type of people I'm pretty good at figuring out very quickly how do you succeed at being light in this situation like what kind of humor what kind of conversational topics need to be deployed in this convert in this group to be seen as relevant leader just to perform well that is my default butt from me it's saying okay you got a break that cycle of the trying to perform and move into a place that is more like not for me that's not filtering what I say this is you don't know this is not your issue you don't have a filter but I think that that's a healthy thing in a lot of ways we can get you into trouble and you have to apologize more than the average person but for me it's saying like I'm actually going to say the first thing that I feel about this thing they were talking about and I'm not going to run it through the how does this fit into my overall performance in this setting that's if it happens very quickly right and it's very difficult to decipher between when is this an authentic I'm just speaking from the heart and just saying what I think and when is this my sort of curated thought cuz I'm so good at getting to the Curative thought very quickly from honesty versus speaking for a fact I'm not saying that I'm good at it so far the first one I'm curious is there something I would maybe small like an example of something where it's like what was the Mantra again how do I feel about this being the Hardy in the heart like can you think of a reason example words like will you will you redirected in that way I think it happens more often in I think I'm trying to apply it mostly in my conversations with me and my family were talking to my mom I think is a good example of like her recovery and she's had a couple of those setbacks with some things unrelated to the the the ankle that have put her in the hospital then she's going to be fine but even in a conversation with her not just being loud okay my role here is just the you know the inquisitive concerned son you know but I can't I I'm not good at it you know and we can go in from the stages of you can go back before therapy I was basically unaware that this was a problem and now I kind of moved into an awareness that it's a problem but not necessarily inability to always act in in in change and I'm trying to move to a conscious awareness when I see actively doing these things so that's that's I don't know how long is going to take to get there that's that's what I'm working on when you're on the phone you're no longer just asking for like the Deep give me the update what is it are you oh you had to go back Hospital what is the doctor saying what's the next step what's the plan okay let me know let me know when you get the results or whatever right you're trying to move Beyond just too practical yeah and it's not again it's not easy I am not good at being what I like how are you feeling about all this would you be as simple as is that is like entering into a real conversation so I don't have a whole lot of examples of like this is how I do it because it's more just like I know it's a problem and I'm trying to solve the problem it's interesting because it's compounded I would imagine those moments because it's for someone who's like maybe this is this, this is always come easy to them and that's not me either by the way but so someone that's not either one of us it would come easy to again just like empathy you're like stealing someone's pain is just something that just comes out of them this is my wife but so for you it's interesting that in making that effort I think I would imagine there's a roadblock that like there's an added roadblock of a self-awareness that's like there's a vulnerability to even trying that makes it even more difficult right it's like now all of a sudden I'm going to instead of hanging up saying love you Mom I'm going to say how do you feel or I'm going to make the decision to share how what she shared with me made me feel I'm going to share that with her and then it's like I'm going to do this now and it's and it's going to feel weird to me it might feel weird to my mom it might like what's my what's my tone of voice when I start to exercise empathy you know it's like I would imagine because we think similar in this way that like we're so self-aware that when we start to you start engage those things that like all of these signals keep saying it's not worth it right like even something as simple as like what does my voice sound like when I'm more empathetic you know yeah I mean it's yeah and I do think it's a separate issue but yeah it's a compounding issue but I think that it's just something that is I think that our self-awareness is what makes us good at what we do yeah and it's why we can move into different environments is why we can't host is why we can't host a podcast the way that we do is why we can host good mythical morning it's better we are the more we are aware of how every single thing strikes viewer pretty good it's stepping out and observing exactly the way something that we're doing would be interpreted or understood or experienced by an audience That's Entertainment and west side of taneously be in the moment as much as possible which does require a level of feigning it what I think that being a performer definitely works against all of this you know I'm saying I think that the people who are probably the best in the most embodied they might be a great dancer if you take something that you like this dancing you know what another I'm going to go back to your wedding again I did a little dancing at your wedding and not a lot but but I can I dance for show traditionally move my body in a kind of a weird way and I'm doing it kind of entertaining people who are watching but but I'm not dancing like nobody's watching and there's what is the dance Feldman when everybody was circling your mom's the Miska Muska so everybody starts doing these concentric circles of the crowning ceremony when the parents the last Children of the parents are married off to get crowned the last two in the parents are married off they get crowned and everyone dances and kisses them and then it goes circles and then RDJ mixed it into the Hora dance which by definition is not about an individual's performance and it's funny because I felt having never done it there's this yeah I felt the same thing that I think you're describing which is like all of a sudden we're like linking hands with people Christian and somebody I didn't even know and then we're like doing this content I can see you on the other side of the circuit of court of my eye I know that you're probably having a similar experience to me which is like I'm doing this but I'm not really giving myself over to it right yes I like I'm Conjuring up the like I'm sitting in my pride aside that like buses about what I will but I will say that even in that moment I am doing it more than I ever have I am I am giving myself over to the joy of dancing in a circle really exercise yeah because yeah cuz they're natural inclination as well like if there's a it's the it's the whole mob people on the dance floor for my circle and then they want someone to go in there and show what's up then it's like oh there's an opportunity to perform so I guess I'm going to do that well and I in I'm a little I'm a little a little shy in the situations but then if the right opportunity strikes I will go into the circle and make a memory for people but the but the giving yourself over to dance in a communal environment like that and that's why I haven't been to an embodiment Workshop but anybody that works out does involved that you have fun it's like freely moving your body in a way that is without self-regard you know without self-consciousness yeah it is all this is all this is all related to what I'm kind of dealing with him therapy and I do think that our reputation I don't know yet I think that this is the definition for both of us this is a this is an issue for everyone everyone has this like I am this kind of person and I don't want to feel uncomfortable and I don't want anybody to make me feel uncomfortable everybody has their own version of what that is but I think in my family growing up it's like we need like we have prided ourselves ourselves on you know being good at things and seeming like we know what the hell were talking about and if we don't know what the hell were talking about we're probably not going to talk about it but we think that we know a lot about a lot of things so we're not talking about a lot of things and it's like yeah it's and then there's the opposite of that which is just like this if you just picture this like hippie just just moving their body to the music at Woodstock is like that person suffers because you're human and we all have egos I understand how it would listen we're going to get into when we talk about my hair and second we finally get to my hair and beard the act of seeming like you don't give a fuk can actually become very much that you do care a lot about how you're being perceived because it's very difficult for humans to park tiny any might be difficult to decipher between this person really is embodied in doesn't care about what people think about them they look exactly like this person but this person actually is doing this because they care about you guys okay I'm starting to understand where you're going so just hit us with hair therapy therapy therapy that's what it is with that and trying to find other practical things that I can do to reinforce this sort of direction that I am moving as a person in the same way that someone might wear oh I've got this little rubber band that every time I see it I think being the heart you know there's some kind of physical clue or maybe a tattoo of a heart something that help on your heart and there's a word for that but I don't know exactly what it is I think that if I if I look at a picture of the future me and it's the more embodied me he has long hair and a beard and a long beard why well you know you think about someone who has thrown caution to the wind and is sort of just trying to be in concert with the forces of the universe and is a member is a interdependent member of the global community there's a reason that you put you see somebody with long hair and a beard and locator either homeless or Jesus and it by any means I'm just saying it like they kind of look like they're not trying a whole lot to like get everything exactly trimmed up and calmed in exactly the right way to then get into the mold that people expect but I also think that you're saying there's a reason that is a correlation between if you go to Woodstock you didn't see a lot of people with Buzz Cuts and military style haircuts it was like long hair beard hippie no bras it's a it's a relaxing of standards and a relaxing of trying to hold some sort of mold and fit into a certain thing now again will talk about how well they actually became the counterculture became the culture a lot of ways and subcultures become oppressive cultures that expect you to do something to fit in like I'm a loosening of outward perceive grooming is it is is a reflection of more of an inward grooming like spending your energy on not what other how other people perceive you externally but how you perceive yourself internally it is it's that is different than saying you know I want to become I want to become more woke I want to be like a guru so I want to look like a girl yeah it's not saying I'm not saying that at all now that that is the underlying reason up there and you got excited about that thought because first of all it was you wanted something physical that you could do for yourself I think that that's what you came up when I say that I feel like I'm in a pretty lengthy but very purposeful personal transition then it for a while. I hope to always be in transition right but I kind of have a little bit more last few years have been the last decade has been pretty interesting terms of like figuring out who is it that I'm that I want to be like what what I want my life to be defined by and I do think that some of that has come in come more into focus in the past few years and so I think that this is just this feels like an inside of an alignment if you try to go grab things in your life in a line then toward something an outward sign of an inward commitment yes like baptism learned about growing up and now I will also say that there are because I am a person who's on camera and I do care about my appearance I cannot help but think so but it's also kind of cool to try something I haven't done this I haven't grow my hair in my beard out I want to see what happens let's see what I can turn into physically like a completely superficial the perspective that I'm not I'm not a lie to you and tell you that all this is all about embodiment and being in the heart and that's why I want to look like I'm at Woodstock no it's it's all so it's kind of the reason that it's kind of cool you look at those pictures unless he port-a-cool right and so I understand that that that is a potential Pitfall in this whole process is that because it is about an external thing and then that could become some driving for us and then I'm actually trying to be cool or thinking that I'm cool and then I'm kind of working against the whole thing right can you have your cake and smoke it too because if this was not this is not about humility cuz I think we're all very clear on the fact that this is about humility I would shave my head and shave my beard and I would look like the end of a pencil like an eraser and you know I don't have a chin that's worth talking about and I just I would not look for some reason I did that on my wedding day yes but I didn't look good and it would not be attractive to the average person and so if I wanted to be humble I would do it that's more like a a Buddhist tradition right is to like shave it all off your kind of your kind of you're dying to yourself you're becoming more like this other community there's less things that distinguish you from another person so the ego continues to die out of eminence is something that's in many different religions but I think the Buddhist haven't figured out the most in like this ego death thing right and so that I am interested in ego death and continue into like tear apart my ego that is a source of light of my problems growing out beard and hair is not going to the Ops III greedy I think you're going to look cooler you know it's like it's someone who who doesn't care but care so care so much about could be caring so much about not seeing me like he cares that's cool and in this town especially where there's all types of people doing different sting physically and they all look like they're trying really hard even the people who look like they're not trying like literally the only people who look like they're not trying are the homeless people to be frank and sometimes you see somebody in like silver looking like a homeless or hipster it was a case of game you can play and it is because the file is a fine line and and because you know the unkempt beard and hair and ratty clothes can be something like a cool thing in certain cultures so yes I am a little a little nervous about that I will also say that I cannot guarantee that there will not be some other project or something that we commit ourselves to that means that I can't lick you like to keep throwing that I have to cut it for some reason I don't know what that is I have determined that like you know the typical stuff that we do good mythical morning whatever is not going to be significantly impacted by Me growing my hair in my beard out now I'm going to continue to get more food on my beard when I eat and eating is a big part of Alaska you got to get better at that but I am trimming of so I tried to just send the mustache sideways but the nature of my hair is that it's so why are you even would like the strongest mustache wax I can find it quickly goes back down so I will be trimming the mustache is the only thing I plan to trim for at least for a while like I'm not going to like try to be shaping the beard into something that's like that guy goes and gets his beard trimmed maybe I'll do that at some point but this is really just about what's going to happen but you're doing it just to re-center here in just a just a couch the challenge that faces you you're doing this in order to care less about how you're perceived I would say that is a secondary reason I think that is a physical manifestation of something I'm trying to manifest internally which is being more present more out of my head and into my heart has more hair grows out of your head that's a reminder I'm getting a little too technical on a it's not it's not like some super I didn't like go up to the top of the mountain and wait for a sign I mean it wasn't like some I had a dream and it is to never cut my hair again you know it's that's not what's going on it's just like hey there's a few things lining up here but I guess when you try it when you really try to summarize that I'm trying to be more like get more in touch with my feelings or say it different ways to be more like Liv Moore from my heart than my head therefore I'm letting my hair grow out like and I don't if you just tell somebody that they wouldn't I don't I think I disagree with you because I think that if you think about somebody if you just talked about the idea of the embodiment and you use the example of like what was and I realized that the cultural revolution to happen in the 60s and 70s was kind of rebelling against Conformity and style expectation and that's why that's one of the reasons people are growing their hair out because like we're men are not supposed to grow their hair out so we're going to do that cuz it's counterculture but I think that that hole like Awakening in sort of like being present being in the moment that kind of came with like embracing some Eastern philosophies I think there's a reason that you there is a reason that you picture somebody when you eat you see somebody with a like a military style haircut that's like all kind of like perfectly shaped and clean shaven and stuff like that that doesn't say to you that's person living in their heart Ford Focus vs. outward Focus your own disposition and then so and then one example like is in a secondary thing of an outward Focus would be people's perception of you so then the thing given our line of work is that you're going to you're going to get more feedback you know having changed my hairstyle drastically a couple of times you know how weather the storm of a Cavalcade of feedback you like you your draws more attention so it's like you're going to have to weather that and a lot of that some will be negative like the reason why I'm I'm staying out of this is cuz first of all it's not my place to give an opinion this is this is something that you know for obvious reasons that we would discuss for 40 minutes but also I'm not opposed to it because I don't think it's going to make you less cool but I could be wrong at that point there may need to be an intervention but for now I'm quietly supportive from the side lights I don't know how that how you going to weather the storm of increased scrutiny replying to comments you'll be posting selfies of beard progress I mean potentially yeah that second on that my reply to comments What you talkin about right people screw it work Focus there's going to be a Temptation because it's going to be so much that word perception that you might say why didn't you just let this happen instead of talking about it was like you're already talking about it button but now what you what's the plan for biscuits here are you going to post selfies of your beard growth because that seems that seems a little counter I don't I don't have to post selfies in my beard growth because my beard growth is going to be catalogued through all the work that we do I just giving it I was given a working example of just trying to highlight the challenge that faces you the more you want to focus inward to my people going to focus on what you've done by friend I don't personally don't I'm not a huge fan when people talk about things in the way that I talked about it today I'm just like this keep that to yourself bro but the reason the reason that I'm talking about it is because if we if I grow my hair in my beard out all the assumption that would be just lots of speculation like oh there. They have a project already seen it they have a project and that's why I rushed doing this he's going to be some character in something that they're doing a lot of people thought that my fake beard was back because my real beard long especially when my mustache kind of brushed out to the side look a lot like my fake beard it so people like you shaved his beard off and I don't know if you're going to speculate at least you can know and maybe be even supportive of what am I actually didn't see any speculative comment that went something like I bet this is an outward expression of an inward reality as a result of you know investing himself in therapy. And expect that that's why I'm talking about it and I seen any of that yet therapy for people who think they don't need it cuz that's that was me you know what I'm saying it's for people who are like I don't have an acute mental problem or emotional problem or even an acute trauma that I'm trying to work through I'm just a person just a human and I realize that therapy is a privilege that I that I can I can pay for it I can afford it not everybody can do that I'm just saying that for me and it also seems like the most Los Angeles thing that you can possibly talk about his therapy I guess I grew up in buies Creek you know I'm saying I still understand what that's about but I want because it's been so significant to to tackle these things personally I just want to continue to be an advocate for its I want to be open about I want to be vulnerable but I want to talk about the changes that are taking place so somebody else can learn before they turn 40 that hey this stuff is very much worth dealing with now I appreciate that so when you see my long-haired long bearded self you can just remember I should go to therapy I really appreciate you sharing that and it makes it really difficult for me to make fun of you but I'm still going to try also can you find me a therapist I just you know it's like not easy course I haven't really tried I mean you don't have to it's like I'm very much in favor of it but it's sold such a daunting task to get off. I'm I'm afraid that something I'm going to have to like I don't know something horrible is going to have to happen for me to say I have to get a therapist and I don't want that to be the case you can do as many different resources that you can go and look at it I mean fact this wasn't going to be my wreck and I don't visit I guess I psychology.com we should actually I think we've reviews of the several articles from psychology.com. Com you can go on psychology.com go type in you where you're at and what you need and what specific specific specialty you're interested in and then therapists in your area their profiles will come up and there's like a little bit information about them and then links to their personal website if they have one and our contact information including the insurance that they accept so yeah and I'm sure there's other resources again this is not a sponsor this is just a wreck and I actually recommended it to somebody else recently and so I don't know if it was there is a specific section for that the website looks like it from 19 freaking 91 yeah I mean you got you know what you don't have to be new school but yeah I think that there is a therapist directory therapist directory in like a lot of therapists in your area will come up as you do this you put in your information and then you can the ones that support you no take your insurance you can I guess you can just call him or email him and tell him what you're after you can see pictures of people if you're the kind of person that needs to see a picture of someone and know what is going to be like to sit across from them I had another reckon I'll just say that one saving man this is a good one let's see what should my therapist specialty B ATT addiction adolescent adult ageing agoraphobia I mean there's a lot especially yeah there's not I mean you can just put a dolt adult I need to go to a children's therapist I thought you meant he also here he's just family and kids as well you made a joke about something you're actually doing alright hashtag ear biscuits let us know what we got a title this one therapy in what is therapy have to do with red hair I think it's you know I appreciate the fact that we had a great why am I so glad this is Meaningful and not not just about your hair actually I want to relieve thank you you know I'm proud of us I'm proud of you me to link all right I'm really trying to feel I'm hungry in my heart you feel right now I feel I feel like this is over
