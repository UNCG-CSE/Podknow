when the show Bender was just a month old her mother realized she couldn't take care of her so she went down to Tulsa County DHS and signed adoption papers relinquishing her parental rights Michelle was placed in foster care the first foster placement complains that Michelle who was still an infant with a problem child and cried too much but her second Foster Family became devoted to her quickly and forever I was the youngest sibling of four children and I was the most spoiled cuz I was the Baby Michelle was 2 years old when Susan and Charles Robertson adopted her my parents are non-native throughout this interview I will refer to them as my parents cuz they are my parents and they're the ones that loved me nurtured me and raised me despite the love and support she got from her family Michelle always felt like there was something missing I always had a sense of belonging within the walls of my home but when I came to outside of the walls of the home the reality of my race really became an issue as a native kid Michelle was an accepted by white students as a child I made a tense to associate with children as it looked like my family members but I was never allowed to go play with them outside of school but growing up removed from her culture and tribe she didn't fit in with Native kids either what I attempted to make friends with children that I look like I was also rejected most of the time they call me an Apple because I didn't know where understand what it was to be a native person that's an insult used to tell a native person they aren't native enough it really fit me into a identity crisis Michelle didn't know it but she was growing up not far from her tribe Michelle's mom worked at a local grocery store and during the Summers Michelle with Avalon everyday the same elderly man would come by she remembers him vividly I'd recognized him and my mom is always said he was okay for me to talk to and so he would come in and sit down and we just talk they had a bond but neither of them understood at the time or later on he had told my mom that I looked familiar to him that he didn't know why but I I look familiar Michelle knew she was native but she never knew which tribe until she was 16 that year she asked her mom to take her to Oklahoma City to unseal her adoption records as a mom and I made an appointment in Oklahoma City to have my permanent records opened and we found that I was a Seminole Indian and so we then took the records to Seminole Nation and I was in a roll number those records had another piece of Vital Information what will my original birth certificate had my biological mother's name with the name for the first time in her life Michelle started and the only place she could think of she called information and I said the are there any families in the Tulsa area that has this last name and she said yes there was one so I called it and a man answers and I am introduced who I am and then why I'm calling it in the phone drops that man was her grandfather her grandmother pick the phone back up and told Michelle that she always knew she would call someday soon the family arranged a visit Faith come down to where I live we all visited and so one of my most Fondest Memories from my grandfather knew from the very first time that I met him was he told me and he tell all kinds of little stories but the one that stuck out to me was the story of the turtle Michelle was finally experiencing pieces of her culture but that meeting also brought up difficult feelings for her and I ask them you're the very first question I asked when I met them was why didn't somebody look for me why didn't somebody want to adopt me and both my grandparents and my uncle said that they wanted me and that my uncle looked at me and said I wanted you that's when she'll learn the man she had been visiting with all those Summers outside the grocery store was actually her great-uncle her grandfather's brother the whole time he had no idea that Michelle was his relative in fact he had tried to adopt her when he heard his niece wasn't going to keep Michelle he went down to the Department of Human Services and filled out all the paperwork he wanted to raise her from the beginning but they wouldn't let him that was a 1977 just one year before Congress passed a law called the Indian Child Welfare act or as it's often called aqua it requires that when the native kid is up for adoption they are prioritized to be placed with a family member a tribal member or another native home Michelle went into foster care before it was created but her adoption was finalized after late enough that looking back Michelle knows that if it could have been followed in her case her life would have been really different and so that really as an adult frustrated me because there was so much that throughout my entire life I struggled with I had a severe e&o identity crisis because I wasn't white but I I lived in the White world I wasn't Indian but I was integrated into the native world I didn't fit in either and so I went Tire lifetime of not knowing who I was my culture my Heritage or anything and had equal been followed in my case I would have been with a relative I would have kept my language I would have kept my culture I would have known my Heritage the stories that my grandfather had told me that I had never heard I would have had my whole life you're listening to this land a podcast about broken promises tribal land and murder this year the Supreme Court was supposed to decide whether half the land in Oklahoma is Indian country but in a shocking twist they postpone their decision until next year the fate of this land still hangs in the balance from crooked media I'm your host Rebecca Nagle citizen of Cherokee Nation in this episode we're not going to focus on Carpenter versus Murphy instead we're taking you to the next Battleground for Native American rights like the Murphy case it starts in one place and ends up somewhere completely different you'll see similar tactics from the opposition and hear some familiar voices like Lisa Blatt you are rendering these women are your rights to direct their a Reproductive Rights and their raises their child but the story I'm going to tell you in this episode has even bigger Stakes there's a small group of people working to take down the legal structure upholding native rights in this country and they found a sneaky way to do it it all centers around 1 law the Indian Child Welfare Act but to fully grasp the gravity of this threat we have to start with equi and why was created in the first place it where was passed in response to a crisis native kids were being adopted out of their families and tribes at alarming rates here's Christine emo citizen of Cherokee Nation and the deputy Attorney General of our tribe it was passed in 1978 by the United States Congress and research leading up to the Indian Child Welfare act in the Congressional hearings found that one third of all Indian children in the United States were in out-of-home placement and between 85 and 95% of those children wear in non-indian or non-relative placements this wasn't a coincidence it was the result of federal policy the Indian adoption project kids were taken from their homes just because their parents were Indian the policy but the very definition of institutionalized racism we know from testimony during the passage of it was that many of those practices were very coercive for example a mother would have two other children already in her home and be told if she didn't place this baby for adoption that all of her children will be taken by Social Services both federal and state governments believe that the best thing for these children where to get them away from their families and away from the reservation and integrate them into kind of mainstream white American society in other words this was another US policy aimed at assimilating Native Americans and slowly chipping away at tribes and that's why it was created the law works and three ways to keep native kids with Native Families First to take away the rights of an Indian parent there has to be proof that they pose a threat to their child second it gives priority for placement to family members other tribal members and other native homes and lasts the longest tribes jurisdiction over their citizens who end up in the child welfare system well the law sounds like a straightforward way to protect native kids it's become controversial in recent years and that controversy started with a case you may have heard of especially if you were a fan of Doctor Phil in 2013 until the tribe stepped it if you want to commit cultural genocide steal a people's children Max dr. Phil they're talking about the Supreme Court case adoptive couple versus baby girl it was a custody battle over child named Veronica she never asked to be the center of a national media storm or a supreme court battle before she was born her mother put her up for adoption but our Father dusten Brown didn't know about it and that was a problem because before an adoption can go forward it will requires that notifications are sent to the father and the tribe the adoption agency did send Cherokee Nation a note but it was missing some crucial information the notice we received though his first name was spelled wrong and his date of birth was wrong I think if either of those would have been correct we would have a firm that he was a Cherokee member but without the correct information Cherokee Nation didn't realize Veronica was one of their own interesting lie in trial the mother stated that when she heard that information she knew it was wrong told the adoption agencies and the attorneys involved that it was wrong but the adoption agency never corrected the information if it had Veronica would have never left Oklahoma they simply proceeded as if Veronica were not an Indian Child she was adopted by white couple in South Carolina Dustin was notified of the adoption just days before being deployed to Iraq he sign the form because he thought he was giving custody to his ex fiance Veronica's birth mother not to white couple in South Carolina but once he realized Veronica was actually going to live with strangers he panicked he was able to pause the adoption thanks to a Relief act for service members just a week later he left for Iraq the Media Cows it as this this wonderful caring upper-middle-class adoptive family who took in this child the only home that she had ever known and here comes you know deadbeat Indian dad trying to use a special law to give him special protections the media made it seem like Matthew and Melanie capobianco the adoptive couple where the real victims are arms out after us change was in the best interest of this child absolutely not but a family court in South Carolina said Dustin Brown's parental rights couldn't be terminated under equi unless there was evidence he threaten the well-being of his child and there was none so the court ordered that if applied his parental rights could not be terminated that he was a fit parent and that it was in the child's best interest to be returned to her biological father Veronica was too when she met her dad for the first time Chrissy was there and I think even even it at that young of an age like seeing someone who reflects what you look like and then whatever just kind of in a sense that you have you know this is my family and she thrived in that home I saw her often during the time that she was here for the next two years Veronica live with her dad in Oklahoma while the court battle continued and that's where they thought she would stay until the case went to the Supreme Court if you were from below your basically Banning the interracial adoption of abandoned Indian children this is Lisa Blatt she represented Oklahoma in the Murphy case remember when I told you that she's a go to lawyer for anti tribal interest in the Supreme Court the baby Veronica case is one of the reasons why she represented the adoptive couple for free and back then she use Scare Tactics to you are relegating adoptive parents to go to the back of the bus and wait in line if they can adopt and you're basically relegating the child the child to a piece of property with a Indian chief off do not disturb and it worked Cherokee Nation and Dustin Brown Lost the court found that because Dustin never had legal or physical custody of Veronica that the aqua Provisions that prevented the termination his parental rights didn't apply to him more legal procedures followed and stayed chords but after her family had done everything they could to keep her the day came when they had to say goodbye after living with her dad and grandparents for half her life Veronica return to the capobianco sand South Carolina Chrissy was there that day and the decision was made to do the physical transfer that afternoon we asked that he be allowed to have two hours with her and they told us we had an hour while we were getting ready to walk out the door Dustin's dad Tommy collapsed he had what what we thought at the time a been a heart attack we later learned that it was a panic attack I think it was a broken heart but you know we talked about who was going to do this Veronica's family felt like they couldn't hand their child over I was one of the few people in the room outside of Veronica's family who she knew and Knew by name and so I told them that I would Ted and I'm so I carried her outside to an SUV and they had a car seat in the back seat and I put her in there and help him strap her in her carseat and told her that her dad loved her and I remember especially now that I'm a mom I always tell people when I talk about this story that had I been Apparent at the time I don't know that I could have done that but I think about how my child would act if they knew that they were leaving and you expect them I think to be loud and maybe irrational and crying and that wasn't the reaction that she had she simply set with her head down and she was crying there were tears running down her cheek but she wasn't making any noise and she wasn't talking and that was the last time I saw her in person will be back with the rest of this story after a short break with hello fresh

our show sent you that SimpliSafe SimpliSafe calm land just like Carpenter versus Murphy started with a murderer and turned into a case about half the land in Oklahoma baby girl started with an adoption and turned into something much bigger by the timer see got to the Supreme Court everyone knew the larger issues at stake and that's mostly what the media reported on that never happened in baby Veronica's case the public still thinks it was just a high-profile custody battle but that's not the whole story well the medium Mist at some people who were fighting at the Supreme Court had a much bigger goal they didn't just want Veronica to end up with her adoptive family they wanted to take down equi and tribal sovereignty with it take Paul Clement he argued against Ocwen next to Black in the baby Veronica case he said that the adoption process for Veronica had been held up for one reason and one reason only because she was Indian and that's what makes this child Indian Child here it's biology it's biology combined with the fact that the tribe based on a racial classification and that might sound logical treating people differently based on race is in most cases illegal but here's the problem iqua isn't about race this is Chrissy again it's purely based on whether or not the child has a political relationship via tribal membership to their tribe your average person thinks of Native Americans as a racial group but that's not how the laws that protect native rights work we're actually a political group we are citizens of Nations not members of a race just like I have certain rights as a citizen of the US or is a resident of Oklahoma I have rights as a citizen of Cherokee Nation our rights as citizens of tribes are determined by our nation-to-nation relationship with the US which has been established and defy are there more than 300 treaties the US has signed with us so it is about citizenship it only applies if the either the child is enrolled or parent is enrolled in child eligible but opponents to acquire don't see it that way they argue the equi is based on race and therefore the law violates the Constitution because the government is not allowed to treat people differently based on race this argument is very dangerous for tribes I'll let Matthew Fletcher explain why as you recall from other episodes he's a law professor and citizen of Grand Traverse band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of the political relationship between the United States and Indian tribes which is the legal and constitutional basis for most federal statutes that are enacted in relation to Indian Affairs has declared unconstitutional because it treats Native Americans differently based on race it stands to reason that many other laws would follow one example the Indian gaming regulatory act it gives tribes the right to build casinos and places were non-native developers can't and cures for things get interesting there's a backstory to mr. Clemente that you need to know at the same time he was arguing the baby Veronica case he was also representing a non-native Casino developer who wanted to stop a tribes Casino from opening in Massachusetts the developer wanted to build their but the state give the tribe first dibs Clemente sued in Massachusetts he argued that when the state gave the tribe preference over white developer that was unconstitutional because it was based on race and send in the baby Veronica case he argued that equal was unconstitutional because it was based on race I wanted to ask Paul Clement myself why he argued against it, but he didn't respond to multiple interview requests if his argument is part of a larger strategy it's a smart one it's much more compelling to say that a lot as unfair because it's harming an innocent child meant to say it's unfair because it's preventing a rich casino developer from getting richer but does equal protection argument it goes Way Beyond casinos is to get a case to the Supreme Court and ask the Supreme Court to find that Indian law is based on race and not on political status and you know we've we've talked a little bit about the different areas that effects gaming criminal jurisdiction environmental issues water those types of thing all all of those issues if Equity is race-based so are they this could destroy the legal structure defending native rights every law Congress has ever passed to protect tribes and enforce our treaty rights could fall the future is scary if we don't win this battle sure there would still be need of people we could still have parades and powwows and culture nights but it would be the end of tribes as we know them it's the same by my ancestors major and John Ridge faced Generations ago it's the fight for tribal sovereignty play man isn't the first person who tried this race-based argument but for decades the Supreme Court upheld that native rights are based on our political status not race the decision in baby girl was a victory for Clemente side but a narrow one the Supreme Court didn't rule that equal was unconstitutional but it did to something else Justice Alito is opinion started with a sentence that surprised a lot of people he said that Veronica was Indian simply because she had Cherokee blood not because she was a tribal citizen when announcing the decision Alito Echo that sentiment specifically we are told she is 3 256 Cherokee and as a result Falls within the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 the baby Veronica case put blood in the water and now the sharks are circling just listen to this Press Conference held by right-wing Think Tank called the Goldwater Institute of the Court majority acknowledge that such an interpretation would raise equal protection concerns it narrowly construed the law to avoid such a harsh effect but in so doing it left fully intact the law to the detriment of many other Native American children the Goldwater Institute has been funded by conservative Heavy Hitters like the Koch brothers the Mercer family and the DeVeaux Stanley they typically focus on your bread-and-butter conservative issues but two years after the baby Veronica case they created an entire department to take Aqua down the Goldwater Institute announced that it wanted to end and their words the separate and unequal treatment of Indian children Timothy sandefur vice president for litigation at the Goldwater Institute says their main concern is the welfare of native children due to the compromises that the statute makes between the the interests of children and the interest of tribal governments it actually ends up harming Native American children but he's making the same arguments about race that we know could up in the legal structure protecting native rights provides a separate and substandard set of rules for a particular racial category of Americans is trying to challenge the law wherever it can issues relating to iqua we reached out to mr. Sandifer about all those cases but he wouldn't talk to us most of their aqua cases get thrown out because their arguments contradict More Than A Century of established law and precedent that governs the relationship between tribes and the US but in a case in Texas in 2018 their friends legal argument stock so I'm the raccoons are a foster family in Texas and a native child he was taken into State custody by the state of Texas was placed in their home. Child has a Navajo mother and a Cherokee father on so it will apply to the case and Navajo Nation located a Navajo home that they wish to move the child to but the Braxtons wanted to keep the boy even though a family on his reservation was ready to take him and that was when the legal challenge to it was started lawyers for the raccoons made the same argument but this time the judge agreed with the first time that any federal court has found that it was unconstitutional because it was based on race that really was appealed and the case is now in front of the 5th circuit that appeals court could throw it out and it would die there or the case could keep going and land in the Supreme Court the same court that's ruled against Equity before and that has enough power to turn the legal structure defending native rights inside out so I do think that it should be a call to Arms to Indian country that you know this is a small group of people coming after our children and if we can't stop this we can't stop them from coming after anything else there's one other person who doesn't understand that Native Americans are political group President Donald Trump last year his health and human services department argued Medicaid access for Native Americans is unconstitutional because it's special treatment based on race if that wasn't enough before taking office Trump's transition team proposed privatizing all remaining native land to ease the path for oil and other resource extraction basically allotment 2.0 and last fall his Department of the Interior took away the reservation of the Mashpee Wampanoag the tribe Clemente had been fighting on behalf of that casino developer the tribal Casino was shuttered and Trump became the first president since Truman to take tribal land out of trust how did attacking Federal Indian law become a bread-and-butter issue for the right one possible answer is oil really would like to limit the scope of tribal power so that they don't have to comply with tribal regulations American Indian reservations hold an estimated 20% of oil and gas reserves in the United States and that's not all reservations also hold half of all uranium reserves and about a third of the coal west of the Mississippi so it's the Supreme Court struck down if it would be a game-changer right now mineral e Richlands are held in trust for tribes companies can't mine or drill there without the tribes can send but if laws I give tribes so-called special protections are unconstitutional then the current roadblocks to extraction on reservations would be, free for all it's no small thing given how much are land means two tribes it holds our people and our way of life but it's also literally no small thing and 2009 the Council of energy resource tribes estimated energy resources on tribal land or worth about 1.5 trillion dollars the stakes couldn't be higher if the Supreme Court where to strike down if it would pave the way for more adoptions of native children outside our culture but it could also set off a legal chain reaction that threatens the future of tribal sovereignty this is our last episode for a while where is eager as you are to find out the Supreme Court's ultimate decision and Carpenter versus Murphy check out this land podcast. Com for more resources and make sure your subscribe to this podcast as for me I wasn't prepared to wait another year for the decision but now I have to will the Supreme Court ultimately affirm our reservations or will our land be taken away from us again I don't know history of showing me too much I know the law is on our side I also know that's not the only thing that matters but I have hope to I hope that more people are paying attention as basic as that sounds visibility is what Native Americans need most when native rights are in front of the Supreme Court or being debated in Congress few people are watching and it allows those who work against us Too Faced zero consequences Carpenter versus Murphy might have not made headlines like other Supreme Court cases this term but I'm hoping it'll stay in your mind because once you know what's at stake it's hard to forget it's hot in Oklahoma now muggy July hot we had a lot of rain this spring flooding actually so everything is extra green I've been away and it feels really good to be home last weekend I was up visiting family and took a little detour to stop by the cemetery nothing's changed everything was like always the cows were munching on the grass on the other side of the fence the sun was beating down and the flowers that have been poking out an early spring lost their buds when major and John Ridge sign the Treaty of new echota President Andrew Jackson promised this land would be ours for as long as the waters run and the Grass Grows from where I stand those waters are still running and that grass is still growing in Eastern Oklahoma our tribes are still here and this land is still ours this plan is written and hosted by me Rebecca Nagle citizen of Cherokee Nation from crooked media moved on Mohan and Tanya summon eater are the executive producers from neon hamidiye Gabrielle Lewis is our producer a Catherine St Louis is our editor and Jonathan Hirsch and Vikram Patel are the executive producers sound design and mixing up by Vanessa Lowe Natalie Ren is our researcher Laura Bullard is our fact Checker our theme song is composed by Jarrett a citizen of Chickasaw Nation additional music from Blue.
