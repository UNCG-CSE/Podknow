me saying you should get on fighter and the kid and a half so bad and I'm guest star on the real in October I got I got I got a busy month I got a busy month did I forget anything else I got a couple game show appearances I got a busy month coming up and not to mention my sister is getting married October 12th so it's going to be a busy fall busy fault and hopefully the fall will take my mind off of football pro football becauseI was so excited last week when the Bengals looks so good against Seattle and I was so optimistic and then the 49ers come to town and they come to Cincy and I might just come in my heart I love you and I think just a lot of people forgot that Jimmy Garoppolo is a very talented quarterback got hurt and more than that is Kyle Shanahan is one of the best young coaches in the NFL he's when I was with the Falcons when they went to the Superbowl with the guy just smart and they literally just gotwhat happens if a dog eats a lot but the Bengals linebackers aren't that great we don't need an upgrade of linebackers and there they got out schemed that mean I just think the 49ers used whatever they saw over aggressiveness slow I don't know but he's clear that they were little they were one step ahead of the Bengals and play Khalid and that game and footballs one of the trenches and the 49ers line we just move in then goes out the way so things are going to they're coming they're there at Buffalo this week so I got my mugs I do remember like seven eight years ago is very similar scenario that the bills run to feed it they were coming in to Cincy since he had wanted game2 could have been and he's rookie year and every was I all the bills about the wind and the Bengals end up winning the NFL Week man you can't Everettweekly just when you think your team is going to tank Austin to come up with the wind you didn't see come I'm pretty sure it was 2011 that this happened Bengals 2012 Wikipedia with music Beautiful Thing and what's the schedule yep I was I was correct I wish there were three and out so the Bengals were one and two they beat the Browns first game than they lost to the Broncos loss of the 49ers and in the bills this week for the bills are three and out and the Bengals were one and two and it wasn't all bills about to blow them out and the Bengals end up winning and it really catapulted them and it having a good season that game so let's hope it up until that happens again cuz I kind of got a easier cuz God dang it has been a tough week for quarterbacks NFL Drew Brees out 6 weeks Ben Roethlisberger is out for the year Trevor Simeon who is Sam darnold had Mono I know people got still got mono that's almost like malaria and then they bringing Trevor Simeon he gets hurt their down 3rd string quarterback Jacksonville Jaguars starting quarterback there's so many teams on their second someone is third string quarterbacks and as soon as I see that happening I know it's going to happen I know what yes piano Fox Sports and all they are all going to say what about Colin Kaepernick what about Colin Kaepernick and more than any other time in the NFL make excuses he didn't fit the system off right now there's too many teams that could use a quarterback like Colin Kaepernick that if he doesn't even get a call or a tryout it's clear more than any other time he's being blackballed even those people to be that can say he's not get blackballed it's hard to come up with a reason why he came get a tryout at this stage another reason is we're seeing we're seeing a change in how the quarterback position is played where it's not so much I E got braiding just drops back and passes but you have so many I want to see running quarterbacks just athletic, calm hybrid like you got so many guys in the league right now that are playing quarterback that could play another position cuz they're just such good athletes and you got Marie and Arizona and Lamar Jackson in Baltimore and Josh Allen Buffalo cuz it is soon as you say athletic quarterback he bought a magazine black guy and that's not the case because Josh Allen from Buffalo that bad why do drum run I mean in Buffalo or plan to his strengths give creditor coaching staff okay he's not the pinpoint pastor we need right now so we're going to put them in a position to succeed going to run the ball lot roll them out give him a run-pass option and what do you think about Marie Lamar Jackson even Russell Wilson he doesn't want as much as I used to Josh Allen you got these guys that a system of what Colin Kaepernick what's before and it's like the direction NFL is going right now is a direction Colin Kaepernick was at when he was got you know they see black but I believe in I don't know how you can say he's not so obvious he's getting blackballed. League right now more than any other time that no one's going to bring them in for trout and I don't know what I don't know I be interesting to find out if a team did bring a man would they get backlash from the other owners as to as to why next week I'm in a weird place with Colin Kaepernick cuz I'm one hand I would love to see him get an opportunity to play or just be on a team and he said he doesn't mind being a backup but on the other hand I look at it like I think his message and his his place in history is almost stronger if he doesn't come back in a week because then he he really made the ultimate sacrifice for his own career take his message just gets out there even more over I'm talking about 50 years from now cuz then they'll say this man took a stand and really cost himself his NFL career by a belief that he held firm to live people say they believe in something but not at the cost of of a funeral at my finances over my fame or a sport that I like but Colin Kaepernick is is really walking the walk and talk the talk so it's almost like I don't know I like to see people win when what's your comments are on that is his message and his place in history that much more but not get back in the NFL because of you if he gets back in the NFL and he's just a a backup or it gets any doesn't perform like you did before then then you got to be like to say I Told You So system it was horrible at the time but if he doesn't get back in the league then there's always that what if notion or you can take it another way nevermind call Vick went to jail and got out of the dog fighting and then he came back and he bawled out and got the starting job back got a big contract and now he is an announcer he is a productive citizen he's definitely turned his life around and he learns from his mistakes to make any mistakes is a huge difference here but Michael Vick got a second chance and Colin Kaepernick hasn't now what if Colin Kaepernick got back in the league and the way quarterbacks are going down chances are more likely than not he would he would end up starting eventually once he got back in the league what if you do leave a team to a Super Bowl I means that once before and if he let a teen just to go and they won on a team that go there are there a playoff team and they're on the way and the quarterback gets hurt weather is in the playoffs before the end of season and Colin Kaepernick comes in and takes over the reins and I'm like I don't know that I'm going to be interesting to so I just I think one at a time is it in a very honest be there were times I say you guys getting blackballed then there's other times I don't like to put a blanket over every team is all the times I like well they're not in that bad of a quarterback situation cuz sometimes as soon as a quarterback gets hurt some people like Kaepernick Kaepernick I might well whenever he's out 2 weeks and they do have a good backup so they don't need to go looking for a 1/4 back like that sometimes when to the quarterback goes down people quick to be like Kaepernick but now there's just no way it's just too many teams with too many her quarterbacks with too many 3rd string quarterbacks in that summer really performing that well so we'll see what happens Monday I will say though I think after two weeks of the season two things are very obvious you can okay let's look at the undefeated teams in the NFL after 2 weeks is 9 undefeated teams I want to I don't want to forget anybody New England Patriots Buffalo Bills Baltimore Ravens Kansas City Chiefs Dallas Cowboys Green Bay Packers Rams 49ers Seahawks the NFC West is freaking stacked I mean the Rams would I see Hawks all three of those teams are really good the first two weeks of the season in Arizona looks like they're coming with with Kyler Murray he looks like the real deal that looks like a great decision letting Josh Rosen go to Miami and and in a draft in calamari defeat it all three I believe playoff contenders I would not but I don't think 49ers are a Super Bowl Contender think they're really good the Rams Deli Super Bowl Contender how to take as long as the Seahawks have Russell Wilson they're always in the mix Super Bowl Contender again the Packers as long as they got Aaron Rodgers their Super Bowl Contender Cowboys man watch over the Cowboys they are stacked at every position I'm not a huge Cowboys fan but they are stacked and I was like I don't like or dislike the Cowboys always been like it's Cowboys news always been who they're playing like okay I like them better than that to you more I don't like him to do that to you from me there there was always right in the middle for me man Dak Prescott looks like the real deal this year they're going to tell Ravens and sheeps and I'll KFC South got Indianapolis Houston Tennessee Jacksonville I don't think anybody thinks any of those four teams are Super Bowl contenders the AFC North everyone said the Browns are this year I don't I don't see it I think the Browns going to be good but I don't consider them a Super Bowl Contender this year I think there's still a year away Baltimore is is there Ballin but they have it that the team they beat her Miami who is probably the worst NFL team I've seen since the lions with O and 16 and then they beat Arizona which Arizona desert really very young team to I don't think they're going to win more than 5 games this year so that's why hasn't liked play The Who's Who were the NFL but I think that's still up in the air Bengals not a Super Bowl Contender after the first two weeks that's obvious in the Steelers are so beat up I think they're not in either play you got the Dolphins and jets enough said they're out of it the bills I mean that I think they'll win eight nine games and then you got the Patriot so and then the West has the Chiefs Raiders Chargers and Broncos so I think it's no doubt the AFC Championship game is going to be New England and Kansas City and I don't think home-field really matters either those teams and what you have there you got Tom Brady greatest quarterback all-time Patrick Mahomes who's coming and if he's healthy there's not a doubt in anybody's mind I mean it happened but I can't see him retire with at least two Superbowl ring he's that good cuz I'm people going to want to play with the same thing about the Chiefs last year at this time it was on my Tyreek Hill Kareem hunt Kareem Hunt is no longer in Kansas City and Tar Heels hurt and cheese haven't missed freaking beat cuz I got Patrick Mahomes I'm just like I used to I think he's my my favorite quarterback in the NFL just to watch just to watch him play he is a must-see TV I just can't get enough that guy and so I think it's the AFC I don't think that's going to change as the season goes on the NFC or so many I mean Dallas and the Eagles both good teams Packers are good the Bears trubisky that much right now and the Rams transferencia division of an air we'll see what happens in the NFC but they're just like I said we never know that the Saints Super Bowl Contender with Breeze out how you know they they should be hoping to go 3 + 3y Breeze is not in the lineup so and they're just a different team at home then you're on the road so it's for the Saints home field advantage is important so we'll see what happens hopefully the Bengals can pull it together and when this week I'm going to try to change my mojo back here just just know I'm still representing as much as I can. See what I I did do last week I was in Phoenix and instead of getting a hotel for me and all my guys I got a Airbnb not that good and bad experiences an Airbnb in the past I got one in LA in La for like two months couple years ago and I got a Airbnb and it was terrible it was like it wasn't just wasn't cleaned there was like here on the bed I literally when I got there I checked in I said hey I'm going to go get a hotel for the night and then I'm going to do I want you to prorate me for the owner and I need this this apartment get a deep clean cuz I don't know who clean up you need your money back and so I always had a bad taste in my butt Air B&B but I'm redeemed because the house I got in Phoenix this past weekend it was so dope used up a nice pool big Tom Lehrer some weird interior designer like a big ass black bear right when you walk in just looking at you and I was just thinking why would we had nothing to do with the with the house like it was just a stuffed black bear and I felt like I like is that is like a camera that bears I that the the owner just got a good look at people while they're in their Airbnb my fucking shit up or he's weirdo Eddie's he's avoiding I can't think of the intruder with Ali and Meagan Good and Dennis Quaid I can't look around the house like one of those fuckers living hear some underneath but it was Eminem see if we got some great they have some great options for Airbnb just great houses and I'm leaning towards going to the road when I'm in cities that are like tropical like anywhere in Florida Orlando Tampa you know maybe even Houston or place like that when I'm there for like 4 or 5 days in airbnb's for now on instead of hotels just do a hotel by the comedy clubs cuz you got your privacy one you can go go shopping you ain't got to be looking for food all the time and you don't know if you bring your business because you want just got your boys are we said it was it was fun man with a good time Sean for I'm flying back yesterday from Phoenix and I'm on Southwest I love Jess we don't talk about the past my pockets but Jesse doesn't fly to finish it just like a direct flight was the easiest was Southwest cuz they fly and Oakland and that's the closest airport to my house out here in California so I flew Southwest it's funny when you fly Southwest cuz you just when people get on you just looking like pleasing to pick do sit next to me please like big should the next me and I have the tiniest Latina lady sit next to me and I was like some rest is all yours ma'am thank you for sitting here and she's like sometimes it pays to be small and then but I'm sitting here and I was going through Netflix now looking for movies to download to watch and I never heard of this movie and now November I had either I never seen a promo for it nothing but it was called it's called that was it is called the D train with Jack Black and James Martin and Jack Black my fucking God I was like 11:00 so hard at Jack Black in this movie hidden Bay City movies about a nebbish Jack Black spins a Web of Lies around the famous former classmate James Morrison to win his friendship and persuade him to attend their High School reunions and it came out May 8th 2015 I swear to God I never saw a promo for this movie I don't remember coming out anything I left so freaking hard at this movie I don't want to give it away but I want to give a little bit away Baisley the movie is about Jack Black is in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania never left this town in Pittsburgh and he's the chairman for his 20-year class reunions and nobody's responded like nobody's really going to come soon there's going to be a labor union and he's at his house he's watching TV and this Banana Boat commercial comes on suntan lotion and he sees this guy James Martin and the commercial Legos this guy James Marsden went to high school with Jack Black and graduate with them so Oliver Lawless so he's watching he tells his daughter with that guy and his wife over and she goes cuz I don't know him by school so he reaches either I think was Facebook or something he reached out to to James Martin's character Lawless and he comes up with this lie to his boss that they got some big business opportunity and La they fly from Pittsburgh to La he meets up with James Martin and he's just like so good to see you doing so good and James is just kind of yeah yeah yeah and and Jack Black's Mine James like a list Hollywood he's doing the deed he's following the dream living a life and in reality James the struggling actor Yul he had won national commercial but they show he lives in a City Apartment he's basically bar hopping like it just reminded me when I first got the LA and when your struggle it and you see the same people every night at different bars there's always that one bar by goes to that night and so one point he seized AC Dermot Mulroney they see him out and he goes I never met Dermot and he got to go see what's up you got me excited to see you so James version goes up there a bass makes a fool of himself he goes hey what's up man I'm a big fan and James like yeah man actor to NBC Scott like his boys and the girls are all right man cool because yeah yeah I just booked a National Commercial Banana Boat radio commercial TV commercial arm and keep rocking out what the fuc Vegas yeah it's cool and so Jack Black and classic Jack Black form goes to the James he's like a man that you are all the ladies man so much pus out here so much talent and then Jane goes yeah guys and girls guys whatever and Jack bite looks at them and then Jack gets the party in by James over the next few days and then I know it sounds disgusting and then James and the fucking Jack don't ask but it's fucking hysterical how it goes down and the way they played it was Jack Black was just so like I got to get James to the high school Union so everyone helps throwing a little when they was out partying goes yeah yeah you know the way man you should go though I don't know what's up with that and then partying and then they go back to James apartment in the way James played it like he likes Max Jack in the chest and then like told the man a little bit and goofing off and then they just making out I was watching with my eyes closed on the Southwest flight and then they don't really show The Debaters cell like the next morning James just gets out of bed and he said Jack by just laying there with this dead look on his face like what the fuck did I just do last night and then James ends up confirming and come in to the 20 reunions and as soon as he confirms everyone starts confirm because their hyping it up like RR Hollywood Superstar is coming home to come to class reunions at any I see how it plays out but I was just like there's there's some movies man I see why did I hear this why did I not hear this like I've said it before but the Dewey Cox Story Walk Hard I mean when it came out it was about and then when I saw it on cable holyshit still top five funniest movies of all time movie but I think not even a comedy but when Shawshank Redemption came out the previews for it didn't make me want to see it I remember I remember like Tim Robbins just sitting there underneath the dang rain when he when he busted through the the pipe the ship pipe to get out of Shawshank but I don't have any movies about and now I saw it I was like oh goddamn that's on the best we ever seen there's some movies Shawshank Redemption Rocky Rocky Shawshank Tommy Boy Armageddon they come on TNT you're watching with commercials you like what am I what am I doing this any point and I can every it's on every movie Outlet possible why am I watching this on TNT with commercials with Charles sings Deli that movie that once you start watching it at whatever Point movie it's on you can't turn off you watch it every time every time and every time you think that kids going to live when the when the warden shoots on after you just passed the GED every time every time you watch you wait but I just couldn't believe I never heard this movie and I was just like get a chance go to Netflix and watch the D train cuz it's a it's classic Jack Black just some of the stuff he says he's with his guy that just I would love to work with the one time just to see what I could do with him in a scene to make it funny just just just let us go him and I mean him and Danny McBride Will Ferrell your sweetness is just a lot to see what I can do with them and then I went to HighSchool I talked about it last week while they want again so there's three and no first name of 3 and over and over 20 years and they're playing a school called New Richmond this week with a chance to go for now and I already booked my flight switch my schedule a little bit I'm going to go to the game next week so if you happen to be near Cincinnati Ohio it'll be Talawanda versus Little Miami and I'm not missing a key if they win this week then they could be 5:00 and oh and I can't even remember last time there was five probably when I was in high school will that was the last one it was 5 and no but I will say the one thing I did watch to my last night in Phoenix laying on my bed I'm on my laptop and scrolling through just YouTube videos and I came across the Revolt debate if you haven't seen this little over an hour long do yourself a favor and just watch it especially just watch it because when I watch the Democratic National debate I can't get you a 30 minutes because everyone is so full of shit and no one is like sticking out at all it seems like they're all just saying stuff to say it it's not like they really believe it they're saying stuff just to get votes and they're saying stuff to get the audience to Applause and everything and I swear man this Revolt debate had three people in general I don't want to knock you out Revolt debate make sure I get there one kiss all of them just didn't song it's kind of pointless they had TI On It Candace Owens Killer Mike okay. TI Candace Owens Killer Mike Tamika Mallory Katrina Pierson and Steven parkit of trap the boat took a pee on stage of the Black Agenda Donald Trump voting and stuff and if you haven't seen it it was so good and I felt like whether you agreed or disagree with what certain people are saying I smell like everyone on the panel generally want it a better America for black people in general and is such a trump supporter and 90% of stuff she says I'm like what is she talking about but then there's 10% of my okay that makes sense because she's very much in the statistics statistics statistics she can rattle off every stat of everything and you want to ask I miss you she's she's pretty intelligent and it was it was such I was I was so entertained I don't want to be able to entertain like laughing I'm talking about just just pulled in I ready go to sleep and I watch the entire Revolt debate and you know Candace Owens is as much as I she's such a trump supporter but some of the stuff she says it's hard to argue with cuz she even said she was why are you guys doing facts why are you booing that I'm Chino and I get the crowd was against her and I give her credit for going into that that for him knowing the crowd was going to be against her and she stuck to her guns and Auntie on her going back and forth and I will say I do think what I got out of that was what I said earlier I think everyone on that panel there was another lady I don't know which lady it was it was there was two Trump supporters it was Candace Owens and I think was Tamika Mallory was the other one those who are Trump supporters everybody else is a Killer Mike he's kind of on his own thing he's not for he's for just black empowerment and black people using their money wisely and created their own businesses and stuff but I think smart and TI so smart and when you get when you had a panel if there were people know their stats they know what you're talking about and they're not just rattling off to get the audience on their side it goes for good and it's for good back and forth the fact that I'll try to see what they said the fact that the bottom line was how can we as black it was all black on the piano what can we do to better ourselves so everyone really had the same goal it was just different ways to go about it but nobody was there for votes nobody was there for getting the audience on their side it really was people that were passionate about this country and in particular bathroom this country and everyone start their guns and nobody other than the one time T I went off on Candice and said cuz you started with some bullshit I think everybody was respectful I think everyone listen to everyone's points of you and I wish they would do it again I wish they would do it again because everyone on that panel was way smarter than I was when it comes to politics and economics and everything else cuz there was very very very open when he said you I'm all for republicans in some of the tax rates I'm in that tax bracket that benefits from Republican tax break tax breaks because I just can't get past all the bullshit the Donald Trump says and one thing if it ain't as smart as cute as hell was Candace Owens is she knows how to to word things to not really give the answer to the question cuz T I said what was America great for black people when Trump says make America great again at what point is he talking about is he talking about women couldn't vote is he talking about slavery when was he talking about was America great again and then Candice started to beat around the bush and then people started like the audience started going shopping in and then see I see you know you're not she was like you're not let me answer the question and TI when it's cuz you started with some bullshit with nuts but just to see the crowd involved like they were and there's a couple times at end of the audience might thank God there's a couple that just couldn't control themselves and kept talking and people had to tell him be quiet and I'm sure some people got escorted out but that's anytime you bring up politics and especially Donald Trump with black people that is a hot-button topic and I just tell her by being watched that debate is baiters the panel God damn it was so refreshing just to see passionate people being open to hearing other people's points of views cuz you know so much bullshit but in there have been things since Trump has been in office that there's things that have been done that as benefit of black people with with regards to their Eternal prison reform and consumer fuel being pardoned and everything else and see how do I give a little clap when they were out those two I'm not saying everything has been bad just saying I just can't get past the bullshit that comes with it and then people like when Trump does do stuff about you is it for publicity is it a publicity stunt but I just enjoyed it and Killer Mike suydam smart goddamn he rattled off about an 8 minute speech about what what should be important and I always say it is like you're the president is one thing but there's been no president to date weather has been Baroque since I've been an adult on my own so do the Clinton arrows to the bushehr is through Barack and now Donald Trump is number one president that affected my day-to-day life on the daily it's it's the the people that affect my day-to-day life or you have the the politicians and the committee on living the police in the community on living you know the people I interact with every day I'm going to ask the president everyday so with that in like that that's me is the more important that builds few more important than the president present to me as I catch my wife is house me to vote for honestly I don't know half the time she just tells me we going I said who we vote for the president 1800 the people get to vote for him what is all the other shit I have to vote for all these people who have the time outside the president and a couple other people is like I'm just what name do I like better oh that sounds like a cool name that sounds like a name I could trust so yeah if you don't get if you get a chance to watch that Revolt debate it's so good it's so good I guess it was just it was just refreshing I'm glad they put it together when I watch it cuz I didn't know what to expect this kind of watching it and then all sudden hour later I'm still watching it I'm still intrigued and I say this I think one Trump trump is out of office then I think they'll be a time that Candace Owens & T I could come together on some things and really create some change and only you can happen with Trump's in office just because t i so anti Trump and Kansas So Pro Trump but I do think there's a level of respect between those two that they can sit down and have a conversation like I would like to see them two and a one on one it ain't Killer Mike more than anybody else in that PS3 to be dominated and that I don't want to make light I don't want to make light of the three other people that was in the panel but I think more than any of the three it was TI Candace Owens Killer Mike to the point where I like to see them three and a round table with no audience and to be able to talk and discuss openly their issues and what they can do to fix them in and just helped black people in this country I really see that as a follow-up to this with no audience do I feel like sometimes the audience they do you know you get the booze going to get two claps go on and everything and it'll get your juices flowing how could it not a comedian when you get the horns on your side you feel Invincible you feel like you can say anything but doing all this is against you then you become defensive and sometimes you can lose your train of thought or you you you you get a do you start raising your voice and then your message gets lost and the telling her so I just think of TI Killer Mike and Candace Owens cuz they cut all three sit down at a table with no audience then I think they could really open up my secure communication and you know how come together on something like I said they're all smarter than me but I don't know if it could happen with Trump's in office just because ti so anti Trump and Candace Owens Is So Pro Trump so the most positive side pocket I've talked and the two years I've had this podcast and by the way this is episode 100 of my podcast so I just want to thank everybody that I've seen a grown I've seen the numbers and yeah I just want to take it right for for tuna and listening and watching and I know sometimes I can I can go from one subject to another and doesn't make any sense and sometimes women say you talk football too much during football season and I can't apologize for that because everything's better in the world or football is being played I don't care what you know right now the Bengals are losing so the food don't taste as good in the sun don't shine as bright but when they do when everything else just seems better in life when the Bengals went and when the bank has not went in my high school is so now Friday nights if I'm not at a game which I don't make alot I'm believe me I'm on Twitter I'm texting the principal who's at the game y'all how we doing how we looking so yeah so I apologize if I talk too much football during football season but that's just what I'm passionate about I love basketball boxing out of mixed martial arts I like baseball but there ain't nothing like football and especially NFL football college football fans I am I mad cuz welfare but I'm all about NFL football this weekend I'm in Chicago at the Schaumburg improv and then next weekend I'm in Montgomery Alabama at the Performing Arts Center just go to Gary on.com
