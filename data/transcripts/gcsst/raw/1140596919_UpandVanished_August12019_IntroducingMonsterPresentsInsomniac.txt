the story as it turns out there was a lot more in fact the Dark Truth was only beginning to be Unearthed in his hometown of Westfield Indiana just one day before his death and people in this small town we're already beginning to talk most Killers aren't very open about their murdering ways and that's with good reason but that presents a problem for the Killer the secrecy is absolutely necessary a lot of killers find they need to share what they've done I feel the need to brag and receive recognition they think they deserve for the depraved acts course that's dangerous for the Killer tell the wrong person and you'll end up in prison for life or receiving a death sentence you going to learn how the I-70 Strangler found a way around this dilemma how he found a way to share his terrible secret with an entire group of onlookers and he knew that none of them would ever report him to the police how can you be so sure of their loyalty will answer that question along the way begin our story we have to start almost exactly 25 years ago in a city known as the crossroads of America Indianapolis Indiana by the mid-1990s the Indianapolis Police in the Marion County Sheriff's Department knew they had a problem gay men from the area surrounding Indianapolis all matching a similar physical description page height and weight for disappearing 10 had disappeared in the previous two years beginning in the spring of 1993 but the problem wasn't exactly new to the authorities either from 1989 to the mid-1990s the discarded dead bodies of men were being found in the rural areas along the corridor of Interstate 70 between Indianapolis Indiana and Columbus Ohio all of them had been strangled to death at the time the investigators couldn't piece it all together there were no Witnesses and there just wasn't enough usable evidence left behind the only known connection was the missing men's ties to the gay community a lot of them were taken on their way to or on their way home from Indies gay night clubs but now in the fall of 1994 things were about to change following a tip from an informant one that wanted to remain anonymous the hunt for another man someone known as Brian Smart was on according to the informant he was at one of India's gay night clubs and he saw another man who is overly interested in the missing persons poster that have been tacked on the club's wall poster featured a photo of the informants friend Rodger goodlet Goodlett had gone missing in July of 1994 intrigued and more than a little suspicious of the stranger informant introduced himself to the man he said his name was BrandsMart and he was a landscaper from Ohio the informant try to get smart to talk more about the missing Goodlett but every time he mentioned the missing man smart became invasive and change the subject as the night wore on Smart became and Bolden and invited his new friend for a late night swim at the house he said he was temporarily living in the man noted that smart was driving a gray Buick with Ohio license plates Chelsea formal wasn't familiar with the area north of Indianapolis he didn't know exactly where the house was located but he was able to describe where they ended up that evening it was an area surrounded by big homes Long split rail fences and horse ranches now say drove to was a large tudor-style home and the pair entered from a side door he noticed that the interior was crowded with dust-covered furniture and boxes as they made their way through the house been down some stairs to the bar and indoor pool area smart offer his guests a drink that he prepared himself but the informant wisely refused it smart then excused himself and when he returned he was a lot more talkative than before informant suspected that smarted just snorted some cocaine he knew enough about the drug to notice The Tell-Tale behavioral changes It produced tune smart brought up the topic of auto-erotic asphyxiation that's when someone receives pleasure from Suffocation or being choked either during intercourse or masterbation often to the edge of death smart asking for him to strangle him first and he went along with it he choked smart with a pool hose while you masturbated and passed out after smart revived claiming a sexual rush like no other it was the informant Stern it was at this point smart began choking him with the pool hose but when it was clear that he wasn't going to stop inform and pretended to pass out and smart released him when informant finally opened his eyes smart appeared rattled they claimed he was scared because the man had lost consciousness the truth was smart didn't expect his late night pool guest to wake up at all and that's what spooked him it was a parent that smarted done this before and the man said that his hands were strong and confident around his neck as he strangled into the edge of death when they finish their Poolside Fun are collected themselves and smart drove the man back to Indianapolis where they agreed to meet up again the following week informant filtersmart deviant behavior in the pool that evening might explain what happened to his missing friend Rodger goodlet he called to tell the authorities about a suspicion however the following week at the time and place they agreed to meet smart never showed and for a while he remained to ghost oh and one more creepy
