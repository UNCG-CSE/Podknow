the sailors had been stranded on the snow and ice for 8 months when their Rescuers finally arrived of the 25 men who had begun the expedition in June of 1881 only 7 survived one man had been shot after stealing food rations for the second time but the rest had Simply frozen or starve to deathwhen they were brought on board the rescue vessel there was a palpable feeling of Celebration Against All Odds these seven men had managed to fight off debt with little more than hope to sustain them are living examples of just how strong the human will to live can be they've been on their expedition for 3 years with orders to set up a chain of weather stations north of Canada in the Arctic Circle their target had been a small Canadian Inlet known as lady Franklin Bay situated just off the coast of the Northwest tip of Greenland but the frozen water is delivered a tragic one to punch the resupply ships couldn't reach them through the ice and then that same ice Crush their own ship the Proteus the survivors were celebrities back home when they arrive in America in early August of 1880 for a funeral was held for all who had perished on the Expedition soon after that efforts began to retrieve the bodies of those Left Behind to give them a hero's burial but when the body of Lieutenant Frederick kislingbury was exhumed a horrific Discovery was made he been eating not by a scavenger animal after burial and not in some sort of vicious attack that led to his death know the lieutenant had died of natural causes and then a long while later his corpse have been expertly cut with a knife in order to pull edible Meats from his bones his death aided in the survival of others like I said before the human spirit is a powerful force when faced with death that will to live kicks in and gives people the courage to do what is necessary to survive whether it's the strength to sever your own limb to escape a dangerous situation where the stubborn refusal to give up hope of rescue people are capable of extraordinary things and when they're very life is on the line desperate people will do anything to survive I'm Aaron Mahnke and this is lore Sailors called it the custom of the sea but at the end of the day that was just a fancy euphemism for cannibalism now don't get me wrong sailor is didn't invent cannibalism it's not even unique to humans with over 1,500 other species who have been caught in the act and it's a lot older than you might expect human bones with clear evidence of cannibalism have been dated back as far as 600,000 years and that evidence is global too but examples found in almost every area inhabited by our prehistoric ancestors eating each other it turns out is one of our oldest Hobbies as civilizations began to solidify cannibalism found its way into the written history there are mentions of its in ancient Egyptian texts and the myths of the ancient Greeks among many others and as legal codes were solidified across the ancient world you might expect that these new laws would be emphatic Lee against it but they were more nuanced than that an ancient Rome for example cannibalism in Murder were both accepted under an idea known as necessity the actual Maxim declared that from necessity Springs privileges upon private rights in other words sometimes we have to do horrible things in order to survive and no example is more powerful than the one I mentioned earlier the custom of the sea the way it worked was simple in the event of a shipwreck if the crew were able to do so they can draw straws to see who survives and who will become sustenance for the rest of the party the sailor who drew the Short Straw would be the one to sacrifice their life while the second shortest would earn the job of Butcher and while we know this went on for hundreds of years the earliest recorded instance dates back to the early 1600s sometimes though there were no straws draw or no opportunity to engage in the custom of the sea in a proper ceremony away sometimes it was all the crew could do to survive and what example of that took place in 1710 off the rocky coast of Maine the Nottingham Galley had been heading south along the coast of New England on December 11th of that year when a storm push them onto a small bearing piece of land known as bun Island it's roughly the size of two football fields put together that is so low and flat that at high tide or during rough whether the water level would cover the entire surface of the island other 14 person crew to survive the Shipwreck the cook was the first to Die the other is hopeful for a quick rescue released his body into the sea hoping that the waves would drive it to Shore and alert someone that they needed help but they might as well have tossed a note inside a bottle into the ocean that's how low their chances were weeks Slowly trickled by with no sign of rescue the survivors had tried to set up a makeshift camp but their tents were made of ripped canvas and wood flood during the high tide leaving them constantly wet and freezing a few of the men grew desperate enough to build a small raft from the wreckage of their ship and they soon pushed off toward the coast but they never made it alive what are the bodies did wash up on the shore of the small village of York which copy attention of the locals they quickly put together a party that sailed out to Boon Island but the choppy sea prevented them from Landing North even sending supplies all they could do was observe the gaunt pale shapes of the stranded Sailors and pray for a window of opportunity when the ship's Carpenter died from exposure Captain Dean knew what had to be done he did his best to cut the flash off his dead crew members in a way that made it indistinguishable from any other kind of meat but all of them knew even as they ate it to preserve their own lives they knew what they were doing and that was hard for many of them to live with even after they were finally rescued a French vessel known as the Medusa encountered a similar challenge a century later in 1816 it was a warship that had begun sailing along the western coast of Africa you're the Bay of our Gwyn when it ran aground around 20 of the soldiers decided to stay on the ship and wake the rescue well over 150 others opted to build an enormous raft from the wreckage and sail to the coast but the ocean had other ideas over the course of the first two nights around 80 men on the rap lost their lives somewhere washed into the sea While others were murdered by their fellow crewmembers it was clear that not everyone was going to survive it seems that some had begun to try rigging the system in their favor by the 8th day on the raft only 15 sailor survived roughly 10% of the men who have climbed on a week earlier without food or fresh water conditions on the raft fell apart quickly they drink their own urine to quench their thirst and eventually cut strips of Flesh off the dead to fill their bellies when another French vessel the Argos discovered the raft and rescue the men of course there were whispers about cannibalism it was expected in circumstances such as those and the new Sailors understood that if they were ever put into a similar situation they would probably make the same decisions it wasn't ideal but it was the best anyone could do it was the unwritten law of the sea after all necessity might be the mother of invention but it was also the justification for unspeakable things far from home with danger constantly knocking at the door few things stood between a desperate sailor and his will to live and just about everyone else was okay with that but in the middle of the nineteenth Century all of that began to change they say he was a bit of a Playboy John Henry wants was a wealthy lawyer from Australia with rugged features and an extravagant mustache and he wanted a yacht so in 1883 he boarded a ship in Sydney and traveled all the way to England to find one what he bought was a sixteen-year-old sailboat that was sure to impress the elite back home down under but he wasn't about to sell it home himself know he found a captain willing to do it for a hefty paycheck they gave him an equivalent of roughly $30,000 in modern American currency as the first half of his feet and then told him to have the ship repaired and hire a crew to help him in the journey and then John Henry want boarded a luxury liner and headed home the newly hired Captain had a wife and three children at home and he knew the job would take him away from them for a very long time but the money was too good to pass up so he had the ship inspected and started looking for men to help him that was the easier part that turns out first make said an experienced sailor Ned both signed up almost immediately and as a bonus a 17 year old young man named Richard join them as a cabin boy hoping to kick-start his own career on the sea the ship itself though needed help Timbers were rotting out there were holes in places where you didn't want holes on a ship and they were general questions about the ship's seaworthiness but the captain was in a hurry the quicker they left the quicker they returned home after all and so he paid the bare minimum necessary to get the yacht into the water and then prepare to depart they left England on May 19th of 1884 and the first month or so on the Open Sea was fairly uneventful they stop for supplies at Cape Verde on July 3rd and the records tell us that the sea was calm and the winds were normal but two days later all of that changed when a massive storm blew in and being hundreds of miles from land they chose to continue on and that's when the captain's decision to scrimp on repairs came back to haunt him as the waves and wind thrash The Fragile yacht problems started to magnify soon there was a hole above the water line and another forming down below the delicate ship with the delicate name the mignonette has stopped being a safe place to stay and had quickly become a death trap all four men grab what they could and scrambled into the small Lifeboat but the yacht was going down fast and there was little time to take an inventory and plan ahead the grab and they ran 5 minutes later the minion that's was slipping beneath the waves that was lost forever the danger is were far from over though the first night in the Lifeboat none of the men slept because they had to defend the boat from a shark attack and when the sun came up they took stock of their supplies and the results were just hard to tens of turnips and no freshwater that was all they had and they knew instinctively that it wouldn't be enough they ration the food course and they try to take advantage of fortuitous moments like when they spotted a sea turtle the meat from that catch probably say their lives so early in that trip not to mention the blood which they drink to quench their thirst but even with all of that helped they were completely out of food within 10 days desperation makes people do on thinkable things rather than drink the sea water which was guaranteed to kill them through dehydration they began to drink their own urine but it soon became clear that the cabin boy Richard Parker was ignoring that rule in the middle of the night while the others were declining slowly Parker was quickly spiraling toward death and then it arrived that moment all captains must have dreaded the moment when the good of the many needed to be weighed against the good of the few the began to discuss the custom of the sea the Captain Tom Dudley was the first to suggest it and while the others were reluctant they debated it as an option Parker was most likely too sick to say much but the first met Ted Stevens seemed to agree with the captain well Seaman Ed Brooks resisted the idea on the 19th day adrift and over a week since their last bite of food Captain Dudley told the others that if they saw no vessel in the next 24 hours they should kill Parker who was already nearly dead they were be no drawing straws for them this time Parker wasn't going to survive but everyone else could be preserved if they did the difficult thing the following day arrived with no sign of rescue and a dark cloud of sadness over everyone Dudley and Stephens were in agreement about what needed to be done but Brooks refused to participate after a short prayer Dudley used his penknife on the young man's throat while Stevens help his legs down Brooks upon seeing the murder take place was said to have fainted when he awoke the other is for drinking Parker's blood which they then offered to him and as horrible as he felt about where it came from in new that the blood still fresh from Parker's body would help restore his strength so he accepted it over the next few days the surviving men consume more and more of Richard Parker the young man's internal organs were the first to provide them with much-needed sustenance followed by his flash Captain Dudley did most of the cutting but all three of the men ate their fair share I can't help but Wonder at the emotional Mouse drum that they had to whether they did a thing they were told never to do murdering an innocent man and then they had to live with that guilt while they consume the man's flash to say the real nice eating Richard Parker must have felt like a betrayal of their very humanity and yet if they refused his death would have been for nothing it was a moral no man's land and I can't begin to imagine how they processed it all on July 29th they spotted a sale on the horizon it was a German ship called the Montezuma and when it finally arrived the three survivors have been adrift for over 3 weeks the German vessel help Dudley Stephens and Brooks on board and began to give them whatever help they needed six weeks later they were entering port at Falmouth in Cornwall one of the first things Dudley did when they arrived was drafted telegram for his wife he wanted to let her know what had happened and that he was alive what he sent her was an incredibly brief and highly edited version of what had transpired mignonette founder July 5th you wrote 1200 miles from the cape in boat 24 days suffering fearful and well now Dudley though may have spoken too soon the sailors had returned to a very different England than they'd once known know they hadn't slipped through some crack and reality and ended up in an alternate Dimension the changes have been going on for a few decades already but their arrival and the stories that came with them brought all of it to a Forefront to understand these changes we need to step back a few centuries when King Henry II became king of England in 1154 he attempted to nationalize the laws of his kingdom rather than being a disparate collection of Unwritten accepted behaviors customs and traditions you want it all of it under one metaphorical roof which is where English common law comes in for a very long while court cases were overseen by traveling judges who set up temporary courts around the country then those judges would return to London and share the outcome of their cases with their peers who eventually began to incorporate those decisions into their own so for a very long while and my long I mean hundreds of years every Court decision was made based on past decisions not statutory codes or pre written laws in 1765 a man named Sir William Blackstone began to publish the definitive collection of all those centuries of oral tradition and legal decisions he called it commentaries on the laws of England and put understandable printed legal decisions into the hands of everyday, doors with no legal training that was a good thing for a lot of reasons but it also opened a new door if all the prior legal decisions were now gathered into one big reference set they could serve as a list of rules and lot rather than just a record of what happened in the past all of a sudden centuries of court cases involving the custom of the sea we're up for debate it was a slow battle but by the time the survivors of the minion Nets were delivered to the port in Cornwall there was a growing opinion that a solid definitive legal decision needed to be asked into the pages of history and Dudley Stephens and Brooks handed that opportunity to those legal Minds on a silver platter we can't blame Dudley and the others though they endured something horrific and live to tell the tale and as far as they were concerned they had acted in the age-old tradition that I preserve the lives of sailors for centuries because of that they told their story freely and without hesitation so when an officer of the law showed up the day they arrived Dudley spare no details even going so far as to give the officer the very pen knife he used to murder Richard Parker but that lady was thinking of an older England where experiences like his were met with sympathy rather than contempt so while he was being honest and forthright the authorities were beginning to wring their hands and fear Richard Parker have been murdered they whispered and someone needed to pay for that crime the three Sailors were arrested and brought in for questioning Brooks made it clear from the start that he did not participate in the murder but did later partake in the unfortunate meal that sustain them and because Dudley and Stephens backed up his testimony Brooks was soon released a free man without legal guilt Dudley and Stephens though found themselves in hot water which must have been frustrating for them because of the Customs they had been raised with and the specific situation they alone had to live through but the authorities weren't sympathetic and soon enough a trial date was set the Sailor is work without support though it turns out the general public fully supported the things they had to do to survive because it was part of life at Sea I remember Falmouth was a port city and in the late 1800s it was probably impossible to find someone in town who didn't have a sailor in their family they understood the risks of a life at Sea all too well I would have expected their own kin to make the same decision The Dudley and the others had the court though disagreed and thanks to a new system for Capital charges that was instituted just two months before The Voyage of the minion that began it was up to the judges from London and not local magistrates who were about to make the final decision and epicenter of that was an eager judge name Baron Huddleston he saw an opportunity to have his name on the definitive Court decision regarding cannibalism Etsy and threw himself into the case with both beat his goal was to see the men executed for the crime of murder even though the public rooted for their release in fact Richard Parker's older brother even visited Dudley and Stephens in jail dressed in his own sailing a tire and shook their hands to show his support they ate his brother and he still consider them without guilt Huddleston though used every trick in the book he brought a jury in that had just delivered the death sentence in another case the day before he ran the trial with complete and obvious by us and then when it came time for a verdict from the jury he showed up that day with a pre-written verdict statement and told them it would just be easier if they all agreed with him the judge literally scripted the verdict and the jury went along with him is it matter that Dudley and Stephens only did what they did to survive it didn't matter that centuries of custom and tradition had told them it was acceptable to do it and it didn't matter that the entire Community around them cried out in support of them Huddleston only saw murder and he treated the trial as a search for justice and he got it to after the jury agreed to the judges own verdict of guilty he sentence Dudley and Stephens to death other is in the legal Community were shocked Attorney General Sir Henry James even went on record claiming that no judge would have inflicted more than three months imprisonment and others agree with him Huddleston had put his zealousness on display and one sort of you see those recommendations for a shorter sentence caught on and soon a number of high-level people were clamoring for something more forgiving Huddleston they believed should change his sentence from the death penalty to a stay in prison and that's when Queen Victoria caught wind of it all and stepped in on the condition that both men serve six months in prison she agreed to do something extraordinary much to huddleston's frustration and it changed their lives forever the queen pardoned both of them there are a lot of easy decisions in life the sort of decisions that are clear and spelled out in simple to make they fall under the category of Common Sense most of the time and rarely do they feel like they're life-changing which is probably a good thing we don't want to go through life treating each and every decision we make as if they were all a matter of life and death that level of Stress and Anxiety would crush us and suck the joy out of life easy decisions help give us rest for when truly difficult ones come our way it's also important to remember that life is rarely black and white it's a long gradual scale of various Shades of Gray and every decision we Face fall somewhere alone that chart is it easy to view the death of Richard Parker as nothing more than a cold-blooded Act of murder if that's all we're looking for sure but knowing the full story reveals a much more complex situation I can't say what the correct decision was that day in the Lifeboat I can see both sides of the argument and I understand where they were each coming from it those Sailors saw hope for survival in Parker's unavoidable death while the authorities saw two men taking the life of an innocent victim and both of those views were valid either way there were always going to be consequences whether or not the trial ended in a guilty verdict Dudley and Stephens weren't going to live out the rest of their lives in peace sure they might put on a happy face and try to move on but I can't imagine it's easy to forget events like those in the Lifeboat the survival the unnatural Deeds the public shame they must have felt none of that would ever go away Captain Tom Dudley and Ed Stephens both serve their 6-month terms in prison and were released on May 20th of 1885 a full year and a day after they had set sail on the mignonette paid the price that was set before them and when they walked away the court was satisfied Ed Stephens struggled with the consequences in his own way and spent the next 30 Years slowly drinking himself to death Captain Dudley left prison and boarded a ship for Australia Open to start fresh in a new place I can't imagine what the journey must have felt like for him memories of that first field trip to Australia must have haunted him the entire way and they weren't the only ones to remember the events of 1884 it was a kind of story that left an enormous footprint both in the legal world and in popular culture so it should come as no surprise that Tales of Castaways and sailors lost adrift on an open sea have stuck around ever since in fact one of the most popular movies of 2012 was about just that sort of thing the film Life of Pi adapted the novel of the same name by author again Martel and it a teenager discovers he is the sole survivor after the freighter he had been sailing on is sunk by a massive storm but he's not alone inside the Lifeboat with him are a handful of animals from his family Zoo including a hyena a zebra and orangutan and a tiger over the course of the story The Animals turn on each other until the only survivors are the teenager pie and the enormous tiger by the end of the film it's clear that pie owes his life to the tiger even though their relationship is tenuous and strange finally 227 days later the pair arrived on a Mexican beach and go their separate ways providing a happy ending to a dangerous adventure and you're probably wondering why I'm telling you all about this especially considering the fact that it's all made up one big work of fiction however award-winning and lauded it might be well two reasons verse the novel and film both illustrate just how powerful the story of being stranded and lost in the middle of the ocean can be all those Tales we've discussed today of the Nottingham Galley the Medusa and yes the mignonette are all part of a larger and older Legacy one that has never really gone away but the other reason is more poetic because characters have names and authors often pull those names from inspiration either in their own lives or from within the subject matter they plan to discuss so it's no wonder that in a story that explores how one young man found the strength to survive from another passenger in his life but that his source of strength the tiger would have a significant name the tiger's name you see was Richard Parker the story of those who survived the sinking of the minion that says one that certainly blurs the lines between acceptable and Tabu but outside its impact on the world of England in 1884 their tail also manages to leave its Mark in other places just not where you might expect stick around after the

one last time that ziprecruiter.com lower ZipRecruiter the smartest way to hire although he's known for his short stories Edgar Allan Poe did publish one complete novel during his short career it began Life as a serialized story published in a literary magazine but the episodes stopped before he gather the full story together and published it its name was The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket most readers adored it for the adventure and suspense it delivered a few critics found it to be a bit too Grizzly for their taste but I'm not sure what they were expecting this was Poe after all gruesome was a way of life for him the book's main story revolves around a young man named Arthur Gordon Pym who stows away on the whaling ship owned by his friend's father Tim's friend Augustus doesn't tell his father about pins presents on the ship which turns out to be an unfortunate thing when Tim first boards the ship and hides away Augustus tells them that he will bring him food and water until the ship is too far from land to turn around a right away something feels wrong no food arrives and there's no sign of Augustus and soap and begins to worry as any of us would as a side note Tim also brought along his dog for this illicit Adventure a little thing named tiger I'm not entirely sure how he thought that would help him hide away on a ship full of loud Sailors but that's what he did it after a few days of waiting for food tiger return from one of his prowls around the ship with a note attached to his color a note written in blood it was from Augustus at a detailed house shortly after leaving port to Nantucket a mutiny had taken place a number of the sailors were slaughtered but the mutineers won the ship and augustus's father was placed into a Lifeboat with the few others and set adrift Augustus himself who wrote the bloody note only managed to survive by pretending to agree with the mutiny alarm the way Augustus became friends with one of the younger mutineers a sailor named Eric Peters who was beginning to struggle with regret over what he and the others had done and that's why I gustas had written to Pim they plan to retake the ship for the captain and they needed pims help the rest of the story is something you might expect to see in a modern Hollywood film Tim is given the bloody clothing of a dead sailor but because it's a ship out in the middle of the ocean he couldn't just up here and pretend to have been there all along so he pretends to be a ghost naturally in the commotion that follows his ghostly appearance Augustus and Peters are able to kill all the remaining mutineers but one a sailor named Richard and they retake the ship their Victory is soon upset though when a storm blows in and capsizes the vessel leaving the four of them to cling to the wreckage there's a lot more that happens but at one point long after the four men have been set adrift on the wreckage of the old whaling ship they realize all of them are going to die of starvation unless they do the unthinkable take part in the custom of the sea it's a for splinters of wood are pulled from the remnants of the ship and Pim held them out for the others to grab second shortest piece felt of him meaning that he would be the one to do the killing the shortest straw the sign that Fades or God or pure Misfortune had chosen a victim was drawn by the last remaining mutant Richard after that we know how the story goes after all that's most likely why the critics felt this novel was a bit too Grizzly right by now you probably wouldn't be surprised to learn the name of this mutant is Sailor the one who would switch sides to help the others and eventually drew the shortest straw and provide for the survival of others was named Richard Parker it almost seems fitting at this point doesn't it but what is surprising about post story is something more bizarre you say his tale of the Shipwrecked Sailors and their fight to survive a tail that involve the murder and butchering of a young man named Richard Parker wasn't based on the events that took place on board the minion X in 1884 they were powerful events for sure but they didn't Inspire Poe to write The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket how do we know because of the date the novel was published 1838 46 years before the real Richard Parker net the same fate this
