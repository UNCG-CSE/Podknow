the Ron Burgundy podcast is a production of iHeartRadio podcast Network and Funny or Die a special thanks to all three of our sponsors Fair Coors Light and NBC Ron Burgundy the new comedy out there called Sunnyside and it's probably the best show in the history of Television since Knight Rider it says a kid named Caleb in a cast of crazy dreamers and what's more American dreaming nothing today if you don't watch it you're going to feel like you're really missing out on History seriously I was in Berlin when that wall came down in history as a party you don't want to miss folks so check out Sunnyside coming Thursday NBC this Septembergood morning listeners this is Ron Burgundy and I hope everyone is having a great morning enjoying the great weather with a little Cup of Jo actually I I can't fake it today at I don't know what to say well I just I just received some news before walking into the studio today I I wish I could say it was good news but no pretty fucking dark to be honest and not funny Dark like Lenny Bruce ER or when a kid falls down it's just it's just dark and full of despair okay I'll just say it I got some results back from my doctor oh my God run I have an announcement I have a cavity what is wrong with you yes of course I'm scared I mean why me if it if it had to happen to anyone why not Carolina excuse me I brush my teeth I'm not an animal you have to brush twice a day so do you brush twice a day cupcake Carolina nice try I wasn't born yesterday listen I'm not trying to trick you if you have to brush twice a day when do you brush your teeth when do I brush my teeth whenever what else does on holidays you only brush your teeth on holidays President's Day isn't really a holiday is it so so I dress during Christmas or New Year's Eve I put on some nice slacks I brush the mustache with my Ivory comb and I brush my Choppers it's a holiday so you want to do it up and sometimes I forget I'm not perfect all of your breath bother you in the smell of rare steak and aged whiskey no Carolina. Doesn't bother me just like the smell of Top Ramen and cold brew coffee must not bother you like normal teeth with the texture of wool then out of nowhere I feel the pain as sharp as a Zeus Thunderbolt so I went to the doctor doctor yes then he referred me to a specialist dentist Ono Caroline are you are you a cavity Survivor as well I wouldn't call myself a Survivor but yeah Wicked webs we weave I think we should move on all right what are we doing today if anything we are definitely doing something should I say and that's that's why we're here in the studio where you're actually interviewing Clayton Kershaw today we have Clayton Kershaw the famous Croatian circus Cloud Carolina I specifically asked you and I think I asked you upwards of fifty thousand times to get Clayton Kershaw the Croatian circus clown he travels through Croatia in a wagon lead by mules do you want to interview directions for the millionth time yes me does a baseball pitcher even know anything about Croatia it might not make sense to ask about it I know but I when I think of Clayton Kershaw I'm going to think of Croatia just keep thinking about baseball baseball questions so he's a baseball player for who the Los Angeles Dodgers yes Clayton Kershaw very familiar can't wait to talk to you we will talk to him right after these messages have you heard of these things on your phone called apps well I'm excited to tell you about one of these apps in exchange for money the app is called Fair that's fair a totally new way to get a car on your phone with the flexibility to turn it in any time with their there's no long-term commitment negotiation or physical paperwork which is good for me because I hate paperwork if you put a bunch of paperwork in front of me I become overwhelmed and just sign it not my own name of course I'll sign it is President Jimmy Carter baseball legend Johnny Bench that way none of it holds up in court it was fair I can get a car by signing with my finger right in the app I just make a one-time start payment pick up the keys and then make monthly payments that are designed to fit my budget which if I'm being honest is probably larger than yours look I'm doing great financially in fact I like to flash big wads of cash around to show how big and important I am to people but even if you don't what's the big bucks you can still find a great car on Fair that's fair they probably have some sort of tagline but I've forgotten it how do I get back to the Ron Burgundy podcast we are very excited to have here in the studio with us from the Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw Clayton welcome to the podcast. Muir on preciate it Carolina to Clayton you're a lefty on the left where you always a lefty yes whole time I thought about switching to write thought about it but just didn't work for hand you know there's less of us so it's a little bit more unorthodox so it definitely helps a little bit for sure the left-hander is very valuable in Major League Baseball but there are no left-handed third baseman or catchers are you allowed to be wrong out of that yeah I write lefty so you didn't play Third Base I did you did that's why we lost every game could I could make the throw across the diamond while you're on third base I did I would read I have a paperback novel my dad cuz I got boys it's it's kind of a boring game if you're if you're not paying attention for sure absolutely the action is you know intermittent and a red vest that was I have a word of the day I tried to fit in my language ardently a lot of ardently when are already times yesterday whether or not it was did you play last night we do it yeah we played and who who did you guys we play the Mets New York Mets okay and we won I think final score was 8 to 5 in New York we were in La okay guess we're home. How are the Mets this year it'll be alright right yeah what how many innings did you throw a 36-in I didn't throw very well Ron I had a rough game really yeah I wasn't super great thanks for asking we just went out so that was the main point when you don't have a game that you feel great about how about how are you able to just you just got to forget about it right yeah it's tough you know but as a starting pitcher you play once every five days so you got like four days to think about it and get back at it that this day in high school and middle school we have a rough day it's going to happen I think you know everybody's going to have their bad days in baseball right but I think more than anything it's just about how you go about it and then I will baseball's love it how you handle failure you know there's a lot of failure in baseball so it's really important to be able to compartmentalize that and go from there. let him know a lot to live up to that's good yeah I like that no I just I just want to have fun you know I just as long as he's loving baseball he can play as long as you want so what if he's like Dad sorry I like badminton I like leather bound books he enjoys leather bound books around here somewhere else have a loaf of bread that's my lucky loaf of sourdough their listeners are there is a giant loaf of sourdough bread on North Carolina Make It Count okay we got Clayton Kershaw in here with your Hall of Famer and you bring up Aladdin and the bite into the bread and he's about to leave you're not going to leave right now to go get will get back to let me ask you this what's the worst city to play baseball in what's a place you hate the most don't know if I can answer that let me know throw some names out on you can host either on the water Cleveland it's it's not my favorite yeah it's okay Rock and Roll Hall of Fame what you guys don't play in Cleveland ever do you very rarely okay Milwaukee I like the special team in Albany never been o Miami it's it's a fun city right the team's not great right now so the fan atmosphere relax a little bit I would like there's no one there not a lot now what would you say like a thousand people in the stands that feels like that it really does can you get you guys can hear individual fans way worse when there's less people because you can hear that the you sucks way more like way more that's what I heard I heard I heard someone was saying that professional ball players you can never acknowledge anything that the fan say to you you're right but says they'll know you can hear them sometimes you can't help it if it's so funny though what's the weird where the weird ones they know your wife's name your kids names I know where you're born you know they know anything that Wikipedia has they'll find it and say it and you got to give them a little credit they've done their research but you know I just appreciate a good old you know you suck does classy I'd say that's good you can't can't fight that say thank you and move on appreciate the fact that they are at that stuff of fans as you would want it Dodger Stadium exactly right yeah I hope we give it get it right yeah give it back you've you've 13 scii young Awards is that correct who is Sai Young and then and my research shows me into an 2011 you won baseball's pitching Triple Crown what what is that exactly wins wins vs losses yes era and strikeouts strikeouts so you were the league leader in all three of those and then that next year in 2012 did you just did you brag to everyone all the other opposing players like Triple Crown winner last year everybody I saw I just kind of wrote it on my forehead I mean you've been described throughout your career as the best pitcher in baseball do you ever just scream that if people like if you can't get into you know Chili's Friday night I'm sorry Mister could you just scream at the hostess I'm the best pitcher in baseball absolutely Clayton you can just yell that well I'm now going to say I know the best pitcher in baseball give me a booth you know what I like about Chili's though is that they don't play favorites so you say that yeah and you are well wait the 15 minutes like everybody else not fall Chili's for that that's right but the only democracy left Chili's yes let me ask what's it like to be a charger with all that baseball history it's awesome it's got to be it's great I love one of these storied franchise is in baseball on baseball but all of sports so cool when you put that uniform on dude do you sometimes wet your pants I do so many cool people that have been part of the Dodgers it's really special I can think of all of them bird hooton who else mostly Persian Doug Rau haven't heard of Doug Doug rauber didn't hear something that always drives me crazy I don't think Sandy Koufax gets enough credit for no hitters a perfect game all this while being the first and last Jewish woman ever to pitch in the big leagues why is that overlooked it should not be I mean no one brings that up nobody there's there hasn't been a female pitcher in baseball before or since and and this lady I've ever seen a picture of you might want to just Google that I'll check that out okay anyway I just don't know why people don't make a bigger deal I agree about the fact that you know Sandra Koufax amazing player one of my favorites even though I don't know what she looks like like I couldn't pick her out of a lineup if I had to if if they said to me Sandy Koufax is down the building I'd be really nervous and I say where is she wants or does that mean is it true that your your great-uncle discovered the planet Pluto has very true yes Clyde Tombaugh collide with the family was there sure we've got a lot of we hadn't Clayton's great-uncle was assuming an astronomer yeah astrophysicist or something yeah he did Pluto and Pluto and then when they said it was not a planet devastating to the all in my mom's maiden name Tomball Family devastated crazy if I think it is 2:30 on planet naming or finding you know what's the governing body that can take that away so they think that Pluto is just a ball of inert gas don't laugh run you know where I get a ball of energy gas after after I ate at Chili's I was waiting for that one that was good I mean when you retire do you feel like you need to discover a planet I would love to I don't know why I feel like everything's I mean when you're out of baseball what is Clayton Kershaw I think he's going to do can I can maybe help you out with the podcast from oh my God I would love it I think I'll positions are there final draft of podcasting to replace me so I'm just I really need to ask you this so Carolina you may not know this but the Dodgers are in the National League and the pictures in the National League have to hit where the Sad Sack American League they don't have to hit that's what's called a designated hitter what do you enjoy hitting his picture I love taking batting practice okay so that's fun because you get to hit maybe a homerun in batting practice right and it's really fun but then when it comes to the game that's more difficult it takes you out of your Rhythm well it's just it's hard it's hard hitting is like really hard like the hardest thing to do in sports in my opinion and I don't practice a lot and it's a face and guys that throw really hard it's just hard hard to do a batting practice is fun it's all right there for you write down Broadway and is a say beautiful stadiums you get to be a kid again no pressure it's awesome do you ever yelled at the opposing pitcher like hey just come on throw it's really easy and I'll throw easy on you know because then I have to throw easy to them and that's no way I could have a head to a picture yesterday hesi do you get ripped in the clubhouse for that I do I do I was told you had a rough day yesterday note for listeners the game reference by Clayton Kershaw took place in may not in the fall when this podcast is Eric therefore if there's any confusion that's what happened the game happened earlier in the season thank you for your patience Jacob degrom didn't he have use of a beautiful flowing locks of hair you do if you cut it all off I don't know why I trust me if you got a luscious Mane of hair don't don't get rid of it cuz once it's gone there's a good chance he's never coming back good enough sometimes it grows I never cut my hair and it never knows it's the same length all the time that's genetic imperfection I was born with this head of hair yes as a baby baby yes that's so insane the doctor was like this is one gorgeous

pretty quick yeah it was a little quick yeah but it was it was a good experience I had fun with the lighter lyrics I mean it's it's you. You're riding buses your it's not glamorous glamorous not good but you get to see some places you never see like have you ever been to Burlington Iowa I love it right on the lake Wellington Reservoir the man-made like it's it's a good time to hang out in Burlington Iowa what were some of the other cities Clinton a lot of places in Iowa shockingly Appleton Wisconsin this is the Midwest league and would this have been single a double space to single a in the other league was called the southern league and so I went to places like Jackson Mississippi on North Carolina yeah just in case you're staying in motels they are you get with a roommate you share a room forty bucks a day for meal money for meal money 20 is 20 of what he might have pushed up but it was 20. Of Subway sandwiches in there yeah Subway actually yes wow anytime during that stint we like this blows yeah for sure for sure that's why I try to go fast get out of there did you ever set a timetable in other words if if it's 5 years and I'm still a double A forget it hang it up I'll go well so I don't go to be a substitute school teacher in school for that which would have been a promise I didn't I didn't know you went straight out of high school I didn't go to college so that was kind of my hey I've got four years I would have been college so I got four years and then I would have had to think about some things probably but thank god it worked out a good workout how old were you when you started in high school and being offered college scholarships I did well I could have gone to college I was actually going to go to Texas A&M University and then you just decided let's just go for it I want to play baseball. I didn't want to go to school the whole time though you're still going to night school right yes still doing that but to to study to become a Dermatologist have to go to college for that I don't think so no I think it's the one medical field yet you don't dermatologist my dermatologist never went to school in fact he played double A baseball when you have a huge Mall have a mole on the back of my neck has a home run but that one go sound as bad as he and my dentist was also a former minor-league ballplayer so life is funny that way do you have a good dermatologist no need one I'd love to see my guy okay sounds good enough you know what his name is Sandy which is a weird name for a guy do you ever get jock itch I'm just going to cut to the chase I've learned I've learned my lesson. Yeah yeah you have to baby powder is a must is unless I want Scott jock itch right and then I made the mistake of scratching my eyes and I had jock itch all in my eyes I never got a bunch in my eyeballs never heard of that and I went to eat all you can eat sushi you was a hell of a weekend in fact that was one of the places that have an a rating and they're like thanks to you mr. burgundy we got a B rating we've got jock itch all in our sushi so That's mighty white of you for that phrase I got jock itch all up in my Sushi hip-hop song that's something that's new in baseball everyone has a play on Celexa when you go to the plane walk up song what are your thoughts I just like a little organ music maybe little Oregon KC and the Sunshine Band Take Me Out to the Ballgame and that's about it but now there's all the everyone's got a song about stupid deal is it it's a bit of a thing that is a thing no guys change their song It's a whole ordeal I'm good luck ritual it's a very ritualistic game yes you probably have a whole routine for a long time like 10 years it's not a big deal like do I wear like my same underwear like all that stuff oh you do I do I mean I wash them but I've worn the same ones for a while when I pitched you said I would say my underwear washed only have three pair underwear for your birthday what's the craziest Superstition you've heard of any of your teammates because they're okay with it yes he's retired no more girls or the amount of stuff that he did with his batting gloves and as bad as it was a whole thing how do you remember all that it's amazing you probably just naturally doesn't just switched all the time yeah I mean it was it was amazing I don't sleep well at night partly because of I get up every 15 minutes Circle three times and go back to the bed every 15 minutes that's why it ritual thing to help me have a good night sleep really bad yeah yeah baseball is a a lot of guys do weird stuff yes no down down down my cuz when I used to pitch like I'm going out of my start days I used to not be like a very pleasant person to be around just kind of like super serious now it happened so it's been better but still a little bit still you let the kids know Daddy's got to work that yeah they know I mean yeah I try to be better but they know get your ass off my paycheck off I'm your father Clayton Kershaw you know I haven't said that it to him yet yeah beats around before you go in to deliver the news what do you tell Walter till everyone on the news team don't forget I'm Ron Burgundy and you're not have a great show them well but no but it just sets the tone do you ever say to your your Endeavor gather up the team before and then say guys if you make an error I'm going to punch you in the nutsack haven't tried that metal yet or I don't know if fear is the best thing for guys playing behind you do you say that to your new steam like if they mess up if they mess I owe them now I say guys don't mess up you know you'll be in the doghouse with me and if I mess up I don't want to hear about it seems wildly unfair well I've got the I've got the juice you know they don't know they don't really like me that much they want to hang around with me but I think we deliver a great product I would agree what is behind the Superstition of when a pitcher is throwing a no-hitter the team will not talk to that picture and when is that determination made right around the fifth inning six-inning it's probably fair at that point and then I don't know when that started like you just kind of let him have their own space and the dog out I don't know when that starts it's a little bit freaky it's the yeah cuz you see the guy just sitting there you want to know what a mess with them old towel or anyting about give you a shoulder rub you probably punch me be having intentions are good there but I think if you're the guy that talked to him and then he gave up a hit deer that guy it's not his it's your fault wow yeah I have to cut to I love you and your wife have been together since you were fifteen beautiful thing so did you go to prom together to prom together she went to college though what was the hit song at prom do you remember I don't really live in Backstreet yeah maybe yeah maybe or like a Christina Aguilera.
