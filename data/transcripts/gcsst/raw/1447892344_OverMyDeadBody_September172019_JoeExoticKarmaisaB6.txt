by the summer of 2018 so it's settled into a little Beach town south of Pensacola Florida he gone there to start a new life I brought nothing with me that said Joe exotic exotic far as I was concerned when we left Oklahoma Joe Exotic no longer had a new name Joseph maldonado-passage and a new much younger husband we met and married just a few months after Travis's death Gina's husband lived just a mile from the beach they spend time swimming playing frisbee with their dogs and watching Orange is the New Black on Netflixon the morning of September 7th Joe climbed into his blue Ford pickup truck and drove into town he was feeling pretty good now clear skies beautiful temperature perfect Florida live on the beach weather to secure his whereabouts over the past few months have been posting photos of the Gulf of Mexico on Instagram with captions like OMG California is amazing and hashtag Caribbean Beach but still Joe got the sense he was being followed that day he was driving into town to ask about a job opening in a local hospital when he got there to park the truck locked it and was walking across a vast parking lot Shady with palm trees when pulled up in and the guys got out and it don't matter how much you cooperate they got to be bad asses so I lay down on the ground to put my hands above my head and still two of them had to put their knees and Joe was handcuffed arrested they said you'll find out in a little while Maldonado is facing a very serious charge the 55 year old was arrested on two counts of hiring a person to commit murder and claims to have been the bane of Joe maldonado's exist I can't believe she finally decided to make good on his threats of violence federal agents A Joe Exotic paid someone three grand to commit the crime and he promised more cash once her heart stopped beating Over My Dead Body is brought to you by Madison Reed my producer Heather has it's really beautiful curly hair with blonde highlights but she tells me she said issues coloring your hair at home she worried about what ingredients are in there but they actually damaging her hair well Heather Madison Reed at home hair color is made with ingredients you can feel good about its ammonia-free and it's also infused with keratin and ginseng root extract so not only do you get great color but shiny healthy looking hair best of all coloring your hair with Madison Reed is incredibly convenient they delivered right to your door on your schedule whenever you're ready you can color your hair in under an hour in the comfort of your own home get ammonia-free multi-tonal hair color delivered to your door for less than $25 at Madison - read.

of Over My Dead Body now I'm six feet underground season is called Joe Exotic this is the Sixth and final episode karma is a Carole Baskin was driving through a rainstorm in Tampa when her phone rang a I was actually driving my car when he called and said that you had been arrested and I probably scrape in the phone I was so thrilled that I wasn't going to have to worry about this anymore Joe was indicted on two counts of murder for hire in 19 counts of wildlife violations including selling tiger cubs illegally and killing five adult Tigers to minor accounts were later dropped after Jose arrest a judge declared him a threat to the community and denied him bail his trial was set for March I absolutely wanted to be there for every second of that trial I wanted to hear all of the stuff that I had not been allowed to know about what have been going on I wanted to see and hear every bit of it because I felt like an awful lot of this was going to expose a lot of the other Bad Guys Carol pack your bags but with a closet full of cat themed dresses she had trouble figuring out what to wear to court I was worried that people from Oklahoma may not appreciate Cat brand and so I went to Goodwill and I bought a bunch of things that I thought it looked as Midwestern as I could possibly look so that I wouldn't look like such a a different sort of character to them than what they were accustomed to Carol got a flight to Oklahoma City when she landed at the airport federal agents were waiting there to guard her just in case the trial was held in the Oklahoma City Federal Courthouse I expected it to pack Joe's fans and his foes but when I got there the wooden benches in the gallery we're only about half full mostly with journalist Joe sat at the defense table wearing a dark ill-fitting suit his mullet neatly combed the double doors at the back of the room opened and in walked Carol she wore a long black cardigan over a dark purple blouse Carol walked up to the witness stand and turn to take her seat just a few yards from where Joe sat in their 10-year long Feud they rarely ever been in the same place now they were facing each other across a courtroom best I had ever seen him to show up in his best leather pants and t-shirt so it was really surprising to see him in a suit Carol avoided making eye contact with Joe I pick up on the emotions of people around me a lot and he's just so cruel and vile and just evil to the core that you can feel that all the way across the room and it's just a horrible horrible feeling it's like you can't take a bath fast enough to get away from that feeling on the witness stand Carol was calm and professional but she had trouble sticking to the questions and kept launching into attacks on Joe and others like him I would start into all of this detail about how cruel it is and how these animals are these cups are pulled from their mothers and all of that sort of thing and the judge shut me down and said just answer yes or no I think it was like four times that he shut me down this way and I'm thinking he is going to slap me with contempt of court at one point on cross-examination Jose attorney referred to Jose threats on YouTube as silly videos Carol cut in well she told the court has been an ongoing Onslaught for the past nine years the prosecution played some of those videos Joe shooting the blow up doll that is so sick and tired of this shit I am on the planet I believe that she will stop breathing video after video of Joe threatening Carol Carol you better never see me in a dark alley bitch getting a break both of your legs and say this is a warning from the animal world as Carol testified Joe fidgeted in a seat nervously crunching handfuls of mints you can see his brain was working up responses to everything she said repeatedly leaned over to whisper something in his lawyers ear Channel maintain your composure throughout Howard on the other hand looks queasy afterwards she wanted to stay for the rest of the trial but Howard convinced her to fly home and he said his big concern was that if Joe could just Khan one person on that jury that it would be a hung jury and Joe would be off the hook and then I'd be stuck there in Oklahoma with this crazed killer and all of his minions would feel so empowered by that that it would be a far worse situation for me the following day the prosecution unveiled their secret weapon James Garretson Garretson was Jose friend get help to doctor that fake ID for the first Hitman Joe hired Allan Glover Garretson Warren Olive button down shirt his greasy brown hair was parted down the middle he stared Straight Ahead never even glancing at Joe Garretson told the court that for over a year she been working as an informant for the FBI and secretly recording his conversations with Joe and Allen it's in those recordings that Gerritsen repeatedly tells Joe not to trust Allen he says that he knows a guy named Mark who can do the job instead my guy is a pro Garrett's and says mark it turned out was a pro but not the kind Joe is thinking of he was an undercover agent marks meeting with Joe was also recorded in the prosecution played in Joe offers to buy Mark a pistol at a flea market so it can't be traced she tells Mark just like follow her into a parking lot and just Capper and just drive off understand Garretson revealed something else Jeff Lowe had been considering selling the zoo yes at the time he was trying to get out she wanted out from underneath the park because of all the litigation and she wanted out of the parks yes and the person Jeff wanted to sell it to was none other than Jose arch-nemesis and the person Jeff had called the devil incarnate did mr. Lowe asked you to contact Carole Baskin he did why do you want you to contact her I guess he was represented by attorneys and Miss Baskins represented by attorneys so wanted me to call her and ask if she'll be going to buy the part from Jeff Lowe since he was the rightful owner okay did you agree to contact her for him yes Garretson said Jeff had offered him $100,000 to broker the deal and that he accepted this offer he went so far as calling Carol in August 2017 she didn't pick up any never heard back from her but Garretson's call set off a chain reaction now is results of that call you made to Carole Baskin did someone else call you back in August of 2017 yes who called you back Matthew Bryant with the US fish and wildlife service and did you ultimately meet special agent Brian person for an interview in mid September 2017 yes and what did you tell him about we just basically he asked me if I ever heard Mr passage ask anybody to kill Carole Baskin and I said yes on cross-examination Jose attorneys attacked carrots and credibility as a witness they pointed out that she had an incentive to get you out of the way all right so not only did mr. Lowe have a financial interest in getting rid of mr. passage but you did as well at that point correct know well if you got rid of mr. passage then you get a hundred thousand bucks right mr. passage was an employee of the park he could have been fired at any time is what I understood Jose attorneys accuse Garretson of credit card fraud Garretson hesitate and asked is that relevant to the case Joe with a smirk on his face turned in his chair looked at the journalist gathered in the gallery in mouth cheese screwed then he looked directly at me and winked on the sixth day the defense announced the name of their Final witness Joseph maldonado-passage AKA Joe Exotic there was a murmur in the courtroom for Josephus and his lawyers warned him that he was under no obligation to testify they were visibly nervous about how this would all play out but Joe seem confident excited he kept twitching his nose like a rabbit Joe wore baggy Blazer black pants and black tie dye his hair spilled over his shoulders on the stand he explained that his menacing online Persona had a very calculated purpose to scare away his adversaries we wanted to look like these dangerous psycho mutts so no one broke into the zoo that was our simple line of defense then he pivoted into a direct attack on Carole Baskin Joe's eyes sparkled this was his moment the room was full of journalists from National TV show and prominent magazines and she had their undivided attention my problem is she's a hypocrite she pointed out there was little difference between her sanctuary in his Zoo because she also charges for people to take tours he claimed that she wanted to Outlaw big cat ownership everywhere except Florida so she could Corner the market on exhibiting big cats however Joe flatly denied hiring anyone to kill Carol she strongly implied that it was all a setup by Jeff Lowe and asked me to five Tigers he killed Joe claimed she was putting them out of their misery that they had all been sick or injured in some way Joe is engaging he was passionate all those years spent in front of the camera and clearly prepare them for this when Jose attorneys asked if something happened in the fall of 2017 the changed his life Joe's face turned red before he could even start talking the tears started coming Kristin Richardson was sitting in the jury box at that moment I felt like this was rehearsed I think it was how fast the tears came on there was no in out trying to hold them back sobbing Georgetown and how you learned that Travis his husband had shot himself and how afterward he vowed to get out of the zoo business altogether huge fighting emotions when he was wiping away is t r i just I didn't buy it other people in the jury there are a few that felt like he was really sad he may have been I just had a hard time feeling sorry for him it came time for assistant us attorney Amanda green to make her closing argument she stood up and face the jury the Tiger King that's how mr. passage marketed himself and that is how he lived his life Mr passage built his own kingdom the GW Exotic Animal park she gestured to Joe but here's the problem with Kings they get used to making all the rules and they start to believe that they are above the law the trial came to a close and the jury went out to consider their verdict when I feel like I need a mental palate cleanser I open a best fiends and play a few levels so the other day someone actually hacked into my website and I was locked out of it and I had to call up the website server company and ended up on one of those hellish really long wait time calls I was waiting for about 15 minutes and then I talk to someone for 2 minutes and then they put me on hold again and honestly the only thing that got me through without losing my mind was playing best fiends it's really simple game but it's fun it's challenging it's one of those games where you play it by linking up different colored dots and in fact I find that I occasionally play it so much that I see it on the backs of my eyelids and I'm trying to go to sleep is that kind of game just kind of can't stop playing each level is it goes up every 10 levels or so they keep changing the rules so it never becomes predictable one of my favorite things about it is that you don't need the Internet to play either so it's great for traveling I can play it on the plane I can play it on the train download best fiends for free on the Apple App Store or Google Play engage your brain with fun puzzles that's friends without the our best fiends I don't know about you but this year has flown by for me I honestly can't believe it's already September one thing you might not know about September is that it's National Life Insurance Awareness Month the unfortunate

verdict was announced Joe didn't cry or shout he simply look down at the desk in that moment he seemed deeply alone back in Tampa Howard was working at his desk when a reporter called him from the courthouse and a certain I want to jump up and do a high-five but our domestic cat just isn't very good at doing that instead he called Carol at the sanctuary Howie and Susan I think and I had written up a press release in expectation that that would be the case we didn't write up 1/4 If he if he won because I probably go into hiding at that point of that have been the case Carroll barely had time to process the news hightailed it back to the office and recorded her statement Carol spoke to the camera in a pink leopard print shirt it had been nearly nine years since our first video about Jose Cub petting operation I'm grateful that Justice was served and Joe schreibvogel maldonado-passage hopefully will serve time in prison and no longer present a threat either to me or to his former big cats well media attention regarding this trial has primarily focused on the murder-for-hire charges there is a much larger significance to the wildlife charges afterward she and Howard took a moment to honor the occasion and as is our practice whenever we have a big celebration like that he gets those little tiny bottles of champagne that's like two glasses in a bottle go get one of those and a round of Brie and we'll have Brie and crackers and champagne to celebrate our our when the news of the spinning thing you've been fighting for it for years really I mean for many years I got a gunshot it finally feel to know that you would most likely be locked up for a long time maybe it's because they haven't had the sentencing yet but I just don't feel like it's completely done so I don't feel like I have that complete sense of relief yet it's absolutely a fear that he will find some way to finagle his way out of this he has been successful in evading responsibility for his actions all these years so it's hard to imagine that it's finally going to come to a close the people who have mostly dispersed Rick Kirkham the reality TV producer whose house burned down now lives in a small fishing town in Norway she move there in part to get as far away from Joe and everything associated with him as he could Batman has hurt so many people and hurts so many animals I mean he's destroying lives and a mine was one of them for the time being he deserves anything he has anything he has I hope he never walks out of prison working for Joe took a serious toll on his mental health night just to forget what I have gone through because I thought I was going to be Rick says he's still suffering from PTSD he can't bring himself to watch any of the YouTube videos he made their 40 Years of serial killers murderers I've interviewed a guy cut his own mother's head off and put it in the refrigerator I've never known anyone more evil and their heart than gel if I take nothing else from one year experience of living and a zoo with Joey Votto it is that survived and Joe Exotic getting in an argument with Rick over the film rights or changing the locks to the studio or getting someone to start the fire Joe and sis that he's the most honest person you'll ever meet there's nothing hid behind this face he wants told me and people like me for that but over the years I've spoken to more than 70 people who knew Joe from them I learned just how many lies Joe is told me when I first met him he said he was dying of bone marrow cancer she wasn't he lied to me about why Carol Sue them for a million dollars she said it was all over that one bunny photo and I confirm it wasn't Carole Baskin or anyone related to her to hack Joe's computers that time it was a marijuana-themed YouTuber named Nat Geo many of Jose former friends and employees were still trying to make sense of it how Joe schreibvogel the animal lover became Joe Exotic the deceitful tiger killer obsessed with destroying Carole Baskin his heart was in the right place when he first started this and everything but the money started getting to him the fame being popular and famous got to him I will always contend that Joe is not an evil person I honestly in my own heart can't even say he's a bad person he's sick absolutely they're narcissistic traits are absolutely North Korea images Joe everywhere you want to meet create event world and whatever he wanted you to believe or you to do that's what you did your leave within the zoo you know you're working there all day long in the cage that's what I call you pretty much call it was a cage the whole part that holds 16 anchors was a cage after Jose arrest I went back to the GW Zoo it has been nearly four years since the wild week I spent with Joe there I wanted to see what it was like now it was a chilly winter day the sign at the entrance gate still said the GW Zoo but Jeff Lowe is in charge now the tiger breeding Carolyn been working to stop is still very much on display there's a big white Banner on the fence facing the main road it reads baby tigers the parking lot still smell like cat piss hello Smith's Syracuse we all Joe Exotic merchandise that's all gone I went there with the producer Rachel Hubbard when we walked into the gift shop we were greeted by a woman with a brush cut hair do sheep rounded us you can walk around like a normal Zoo it was Eerie there's no one I mean there's not one visitor there's not one in play it's it's a ghost town I think that right here that used to be a big stage area I guess Jeff doesn't have any need for a stage as I walked around I noticed the alligator the champ the hyena they were all gone it's just squirrels pigeons it's just like a random animals that could probably should be about free and we'll be fine I think I don't know why there are squirrels in here we strolled down tiger Ali so we could meet you and I tried to make it count how many cats were left when a bright red hair pulled back in a ponytail she demanded Rachel turn off your microphone off in front of the things as well and that's a No-No or guys we put away our recording equipment and left Jeff Lowe is announced he has plans to close the zoo and move everything a few hours south right down the road from the world's largest casino if that happens there will be nothing left of the Kingdom Joe

me I have not been up for 7 months I have not seen the Sun or or breathe air and seven much is a 45-minute drive Southwest of Oklahoma City it's a giant tan-colored cube with virtually no windows there is more regulations under the Animal Welfare act to take care of an animal at a zoo than expected to be handed down this past July but it's a strange case the court is still deciding how to handle a murder-for-hire conviction that also includes several counts of animal abuse keep potentially faces up to 20 years in prison for the murder For Hire charges and up to 49 years for the animal charges recently I asked you if he misses the zoo and what I miss is the closeness being able to go in there and let me know if he gets out his dream is to build a new kind of zoo if there's going to be anything in captivity it's going to have acres to run on animals just like lions with Jay Bruce and it turns out of all the things he's done in his life this is the one thing Joe does feel remorseful about keeping big cats in cages nnn looking looking for bars and I look for a little porthole window in a metal door Joe is currently pinning his hopes on a presidential pardon she also plans to appeal as case and he still maintains he's completely innocent anything wrong but did I even offered I don't want implicated in this I have listened to those recordings and it simply isn't true there's plenty of incriminating evidence in there I asked Joe once about that one tape where he said that if Alan got caught red-handed me and Jeff got our story down to where we fired the mother fucker and he just went off the deep end Joe said that he was merely playing along with the bought Jeff Lowe it hatched we're feeling much better that he's at least in jail and there's still the Potential Threat from others but we go back to our normal level of threat. Like in in in those Homeland Security where they have the the colors I mean we don't go below yellow with the plot to kill Carole Baskin there's one thing Carolyn Joe do agree on I think Jeff Lowe absolutely was involved in the murder For Hire case I didn't think anything was happening with Joe I didn't think the police were doing anyting all of these years so the fact that they put together a case was a real shocker to me and I'm really hoping to be pleasantly surprised at some point to find out that they've been doing the same thing with Jeff Lowe evidence at trial suggested to Jeff knew about the pot prosecutors wouldn't comment on why Jeff or Allen Glover the first hit man with the teardrop tattoo arrested in the case an email Jeff said I was or would have been a subject of the investigation in the smartest thing I ever did was go to the feds with my concerns when he took over the zoo Jeff Lowe also to conchos debt to the Baskins they're still tied up in litigation but the Baskins are working on something bigger that would shut down Jeff and others like him Charles currently lobbying for a new Bill in Congress called the big cat public safety act which would outlaw Cub petting and the private ownership of big cats I have a quote on my desk by Woodrow Wilson it says if you want to make enemies try to change something internal is still running the sanctuary in Tampa I visited Big Cat Rescue and it's nothing like Joe said it was pleasantly jungly is a large enclosure shaded by trees we do not breed any cat people not see any comes or can't hear I asked Carol to imagine the day when she has finally succeeded and there are no more big cats in cages not even in her own Sanctuary wouldn't you miss them every time I see this cats in a cage even here she said if I were to open every door out here not one of these cats would be on this property tonight they want to be free this is Carol's Obsession she insist to this day that the fight with Joe Exotic was never about Joe Exotic matter how personal his attacks became she never responded in kind but it's also clear that she takes pride and never backing down from a fight she wants wrote on her website I always win I am not posting here but stating a frame of mind that I've had since I was a child and it has served me well next. Reminds me of this was my last phone call and I'm going to go kill Carolyn to go shoot her you said I fantasize I said that you said I never used to fantasize about seeing someone's brains on the wall and you know it was like a moment we're like you were talking but at the same time sizing about that mean set aside the case was that something you were thinking about Rob I'm not saying that you were going to I'm saying that you're thinking that you were so why did you tell me that why would you say that find a group of people retreating were you trying to shock us and what was going on and so often said on Facebook and and in your videos about karma is a karma is a bitch and it's coming for you Carol this is so trapped in a fiery burning car I hope and that's going to be her, and so do you know what my next question is going to be which is what do you think your karma is that landed you in there what did you do that made you have to go through all this this pain and suffering by Idina from what I have witnessed in here with the gym and Ice kidnapping there's nothing short of this being illegal human trafficking so so you won't you won't cop to anything in your past giving you bad karma that might have that might have resulted in this not that not the case not necessarily anything having to do with the murder For Hire but anything you've done do you ever sit and think it will take to make sure that the government supposed to happen when you feel that that was at all the witnesses there all wine I think it is poetic justice that he could potentially spend the rest of his life in a cage given the fact that he caused so many of these magnificent animals to be bred for the purpose of being exploited and abused and kept prisoner their entire lives tell me his name from six feet underground from wondery this is the Sixth and final episode of Over My Dead Body this season is called Joe Exotic will have a special interview episode next week so stay subscribed here if you'd like to help us spread the word please give us a 5-star review and tell your friends to subscribe we're available on Apple podcasts Spotify castbox in every major listening app as well as Wonder e.com if you're listening on a smartphone tap or swipe over the cover art of this podcast you find the episode notes including some details may have missed that's also where you'll find a link to my story about Joe Exotic in New York Magazine you'll also find some offers from our sponsors we support our sponsors you help us bring you our shows for free and thank you if you have a tip about a story involving two people pushed to their limits that could be the next season of Over My Dead Body email us at tips at wondering.
