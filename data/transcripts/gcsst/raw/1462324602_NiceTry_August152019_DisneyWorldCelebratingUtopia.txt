here's one last thing about Utopia we did a live event in New York City at the 92nd Street y with the New York Times has Katy Weaver Katie has written I kid you not some of my favorite articles of all time like her story about a trip to the Glitter Factory to see how glitter gets made and her GQ profile Dwayne Johnson is just my favorite piece of celebrity writing maybe ever but I don't talk at the 92nd Street y Katie wanted to go over a very particular Utopia that she grew up going to Walt Disney World in Orlando Florida I had of our conversation Katie and I both read a book called married to the mouse by Richard Vogel song which is full just wild details about Disney's utopian Visions which we may or may not have remembered incorrectly on stage apologies if you're listening Richard you focus on but the themes present in the establishment of Disney World realreflected the other ideas that we've already covered in the series that's just kind of ties the room together if you will so here's my conversation with Katie Weaver just as a reminder of the discussion about Utopias and the failures and successes inherent in them is an ongoing one Welcome to our book club thank you so much for coming at 3 exciting that so many people are interested in talking about Utopias and if maybe listen to the podcast but I wanted I don't know there's a lot of podcasts out there but I wanted to start out by sharing a little anecdote that didn't make it into the story of Oneida one of my favorite books that we read the series was the book about Oneida by Ellen Wayland Smith to call tonita and it's so beautiful because it not only talks about this one Utopia but I really like putting contacts and talks about lots of different American Utopia is an 1800 which is kind of like a utopian Heyday and one part she talked about the origin of the word con man ask him some confidence man who was a man there was a guy and his name was William Thompson and he was arrested in New York City in 1849 because she would come with the strangers in New York City and like a chat them up and walk with them a little bit and then he would say do you have the confidence to trust the stranger with your watch and it runs like a heart like you are not my friends and so I had him their confidence and their watch and he would just walk away and that was his Chris and it's really interesting because like in his arrest he became kind of this Boogeyman because everyone freaked out there like who are these loan men roving around the city on detached from like family or Community they have no moral compass and they have this like hypnotic control over people and then lo and behold like in the late 1800 only like 50 years later that archetype it's totally switched around we like he becomes the American Feldman he becomes like the the the influencer and Tequilas how to make friends and influence people and I think you know the reason this came up in the united book and I think the reason this is recurrent in like talking about Utopia is often times they are led by not a wise man but usually men extremely charismatic people who are the witching and you have interviewed and spend time with many people who I would follow you to the ends of the Earth and I wonder what you think of the current state of influence oh my god look confident people can truly do anything even if they are morons that's the secret to life I have confidence Men though in the story that you told legal I was he arrested you told people to give him that were watching they did with the crying now in New York City I think we'll definitely I think you meet some people who are famous and you can just tell like I know why you're famous they have that certain something that you just really can't take your eyes off them even when they are you know out of hair and makeup or watching around their homes around set somewhere I think I said this to you when we did a preliminary interview on the phone that I think we prepared expensive I think bewitching is one of the nicest compliments you can give to someone or say about when the food have so impressed you that it's like they've cast a spell so I feel like I am absolutely stuck to hold two confidence men and women and I started people I mean do you think it's something that we can like achieve or are these people that you spend time with their life when I was a child I always knew I was special I think you can achieve it I really think that that you can do it you probably have to have something a little bit wrong in your brain to want to but I don't think it's harder than like learning to hit a baseball say I think was enough time and dedication anyone can learn to be confident just bake it and then if you forget that you're faking it and you become a monster and then you start a cult and then you get on the podcast get into this a little bit later to but the idea of like for so many people are you really think about what you told me it is it's often like an escaped from government you know whether that means you are like a Libertarian Utopia tour you want to like live by your values and you don't think that the country you live in like encapsulate those values and a lot of weight like the easiest way to do that is to just follow the one guy like you make one decision which is to follow this one person and the rest of it comes like pretty easily and then where it starts getting wherever Utopia trips up is like their leader goes crazy or does or they're like oh no now we got to do everything by consensus and then it's like not even joking anymore again and then you have like eight hour long meetings to decide everything and then you know that can still be communal living but it's like that forgets a difficult like government people is hard like introverts and extroverts and it kind of makes me crazy how now it seems very involved to identify as an introvert and extrovert really get things done and there's a reason they're so popular no offense to any introverts out there I don't even know if I really believe in introverts vs. extroverts introverted but I think we should have stopped and rebelling against are really good medic like I also like to be alone it's like good otherwise you're a psychopath should we talk about the most extroverted man I've ever heard of so why did you want to talk about Disney as well as everyone can probably tell from the way I walked out here my family and I are members of the Disney Vacation Club we are at a higher class of people with my parents aren't Disney obsessive we became members of the TV because our program for today properties because my mom really hates to waste money and so she knew if she set up a system whereby she was paying for a vacation every year she would never let herself not take that vacation so she's like okay will do this and then I know I'll have to take a vacation every year because I'm already paying for it so we started going to do I guess every year maybe every other year like a week by how well-run it is and if you go to Disney you know over several years you will see it kind of grow and improve and I got to say it never gets worse you never go in think like this isn't as bad as it was last time it's always a little bit better somehow like they get better at managing lies the rides are a little bit better so it's very interested in that and then on one of our trips we went to the town called celebration that is I don't even know how to describe it I guess it's like it's kind of Disney Company town but you don't have to work for Disney to live there it's it's a lot I heard about this book and married to the mouse from a friend of mine who is like a similar kind of Switched if you will buy Disney and he's just like everything in this book is insane should read it and we did and it is truly insane the founding of Disney Disney World specifically how it came about will blow your mind and make you think that you can do well okay so you said you like more in a Disney fan but like spending all this time there throughout your childhood like did you become a Disney fan real I can probably about as much as the average person have a Mickey Mouse filter to the head I like to bet on the favourite I know that a Disney movie will probably be very well done extremely calculated to make me laugh you make me cry here I like to see people do what they are good at and that's what Disney World is but it's too like a psychotic degree so is it like is it a Utopia thinking about this a lot and I think cuz I know the price of the podcast it's really bad like Utopia don't exist can't exist since like proven it because Disney is a Utopia but it's only Utopia for certain people so I guess that by definition baby makes it not a Utopia because the I actually didn't know this until reading this book maybe it's really obvious that people but apparently tourism-based economy most people have extremely low wages and is very little potential for growth so the workers at Disney when this book was written I think 3/4 of them may be required some form of like State assistance food stamps subsidized housing something with medical care so it's definitely not for everyone but I would say for maybe like 8 Disney Executives they have absolutely created a Utopia on Earth and so yeah what about the story of the founding of Disney world is so crazy can we maybe just go back and forth and say a couple facts that jumped out at us or okay so so there is a 1967 Florida law on the books I believe to this day that gives Disney the legal authority to open and run a nuclear reactor on Disney property but you know what there's no one I would trust more to run a nuclear reactor if you've been to those parks and they be guarded really well yeah of course my favorite thing was that so oh man I feel like a huge hug at once right I like all know do I have to tell the whole story so the interesting thing about Disney World was his mind Epcot the experimental prototype community of tomorrow was supposed to be a true community in like if we're supposed to live there and they're going to be schools and they're going to be trans and it's going to be a real and it's really interesting the time that he was dreaming about this and working on it it was very much inspired by the 1964 New York World's Fair and also in the sixties are all these major uprisings in American cities there was like oh my God American cities are in crisis and so he hired this Consultants kind of do this podcast and go back and look at all the planned communities throughout history and they had one of their takeaways was that they are all they all fail because they look backwards they don't look for words and you see this a lot like for example United communities like a farmer had alike make spoons unlike be modern people so everyone like for us here together like we can be the best foundation and then the other thing that they suggest it is kind of weird before they're like you need to find a way to circumvent government and I absolutely did not as how they created the yeah so for those who don't know Disney basically has its own private government that operates within for a wished also say I think I'm probably misremembering every single detail of this oh yeah none of this is basically private government with in Florida I think the only things that they have to the kind of run by the state or they have to pay some for my taxes property taxes other they also have ways to get around that an elevator inspections and everything else they do themselves they have their own Emergency Services fire department roads what else is there. Have a private they have like a legion of security guards that they've hired instead of a police force they can also use eminent domain it's crazy it's completely completely bananas and the other thing about the security guards that they look exactly like regular cops but they can't arrest people because they are not cops but they have bad like cars with flashing lights they wear what appears to be a cop's uniform and there was a transcript from a court case I think in the 90s where someone was asking okay well if you're not a cop are you dressed like a cop and they're like does a cow sound like somebody's uniform I am in the costume of some sort of authority figure it's totally and then the reason they were allowed to do all this is because Disney was like we are building the experimental for like prototype city of the future we need the line was we need to make sure we don't have legislation so we can keep this in a constant state of becoming this is just like a crazy like Goofy and Mantra and then cut open and their residences they're just like didn't make it on their promise at all and so of course you know I'm visiting from Oakland today and text is taking over all of our cities and you could just as easily replaced Disney with like Amazon or Google or you know any other giant company that comes in and wants to make a deal with local government it's just really interesting because at the end of the day you're really know what your date they can talk a big game and you'll really know what you're going to get and the whole the whole theme of this is called married to the mouse and it's always kind of felt like the marriage between Orlando and Walt Disney and the chapters are there and dipity seduction secrecy marriage growth conflict abuse negotiation therapy which leads to a lot of questions about Richard you Fogel songs personal life it's like very much about these marriages that were seeing or I guess he's like courtships we're seeing all around us today that I think is seems different at least on the surface and maybe that they know I don't know how it manifests that when Disney was Scouting For This land they chose Orlando because it was where a bunch of Roads Matt but it was very underdeveloped it was pretty much just like citrus Groves is my understanding and so they were able to basically invent these laws out of thin air that said you can do whatever you want on this random Orange Grove land and I think it's Amazon has had trouble stay in New York because they're trying to move into a city that is already very well-established and so maybe the secret to building a successful Utopia for your executive is that you have to do it somewhere where not many people live already and Disney definitely figure that out and they also had asked you where they're like it has to straddle two counties so that we can play off one another and they said it was okay exactly cities that are developing I was recently given this guide to songdo New City song. Which is one of these like smart cities of popping up all over the world this one is in Korea I believe yeah it's in South Korea and it's supposed to be basically like an experimental prototype community of the future that was built from scratch and they're like this will have all the amenities and it will have like businesses and and and shopping centers and it's like empty like no one is there right now and so I think we're seeing this like I was a few years ago I was lucky enough to go on a trip to Dubai where there's an empty buildings with no one in them like there's nothing there before like we can just build there but I guess those things that is still I mean it literally awesome like it's so incredible that these cities can just get built but it's also kind scary when it's built by a singular vision of a for-profit company who is trying to be in a constant state of becoming totally so I guess like how did it feel for you on the ground being in Disney World and celebration like it it feel uncanny absolutely it feels definitely like nowhere else you've ever been but it is very relaxing now that I know I can't get arrested by a real cop there's going to be more relaxed and everything is power wash in the book they mentioned that Disney built pneumatic tubes under the ground with call The Trash Away to behind Splash Mountain so it's like the truth even there it's but it it definitely doesn't feel real so it's you know I think it's well done to are you walking to like clean empty town and think like I love it I want to buy hot dog here if it's just me or do you see that and think like I think probably a lot of bad things had to happen for the time to be so nice I mean it's so I was reading about celebration particularly and thinking about these new towns and thinking about places like all the new developments in Dubai I think about this idea I'd like the new uncanny City and it reminds me of the story of Saint to go that we told him the podcast that like it was built from the ground up it was built from scratch it was kind of like weird and empty in the beginning but now it's extremely populous and by depending on your metric very successful and I think it was you know you can look I'm sure Europeans Coming to America in like the 1800 like that so weird it's like steak Europe for the tiger all their trees are so small and you know like our White House is a knockoff of you know the government building in Dublin like yeah yeah it's crazy like you know Cambridge and Oxford like we live in a Land of knock off and just how long does it take how long does it take for something to feel real special because like the world population is growing all the time and we have to build new things and it's so hard not to be it feels new aesthetic but I guess the thing that struck me about celebration was I was like oh it's so weird and they were like working so hard to make it as possible you know even dictating to be like Draconian well but seems to ask these Draconian Covenant that are like you can paint your house XYZ color and you know it has to be XYZ style which in some ways was a way to keep it like uniform and authentic enough that other like worst covenants like you can't put any political stickers on her on your house had to take it down two days after sex with more than three people sleeping in a bedroom can do it so it's just like you know when I was talking with Michael bierut who might be here who works on the the signage for celebration and he was saying often times you just need to wait for the trees to grow like it just is that when you go to a new place the trees feel too short and I like everything everything is just like to shiny and then it will become like new authentic one day I got my God

But they're very distant architectures I remember seeing that and I remember that at least in my mind a lot of the streets were name is celebration so it was like felabration Road and I hope I'm not miss remembering that cuz I think it's very creepy and if I invented it then it's a lot of pictures a world which I kind of sort of going for other technically they had this word Annex that from Disney property in some way because since they're going to be real people living there who were not Disney employees did not want to be involved with real residents who have opinions and who would like to have civil rights so so celebrations like kind of run separately but it was imaginary by Disney so it's still has that kind of slightly uncanny look about it. Like you have to go to a weird place and I don't think I'm going to live there cuz I'm sure it's too expensive but I'll definitely go have dinner there but you'd have a celebration so I think it was taken off Wikipedia because they weren't Source but I started to Google some and I believe them Atlanta Braves baseball player a woman who designs for Disney and Hot Topic and she makes sort of like Hot Topic sexy versions of Disney Princesses two prominent Brazilians but well-liked are the things a celebration was supposed to be kind of like the Michael Eisner was taken over the Disney company was like a genuine design bus and he was investing and design architecture before it was like cool before starchitecture was a thing before we all were like oh this is an important building this is like I'm Michael Graves building he was he kind of have a can't hear the the is like a rose a really precious isn't it to spend the extra money to hire really really really famous Architects to come make amazing work in celebration celebration is like a postmodernist dream there's like I'm Michael Graves post office and A Philip Johnson town hall and a movie theater and a Venturi Scott Brown back and they're like all right next to each other it's totally cool and it was meant to attract a hipster like me like this kind of life clientele that was supposed to be like the side of me different than the people who were obsessed with Disney and you know one of its positive never managed to get out of that like for Disney property and like they're at their school was supposed to be like a real experimental with no grades and like a narrative report and the parents are like what is this shit like crazy like half the parents were really into it that's why they move there and then the other half were like my child doesn't have a great so they basically made a regular school band and it just hums anytime you do anything with the school that's why you can't have a Utopia because parents going to complain about the school no matter what you do it's true always it's always a problem indoctrinated in the Next Generation because if you didn't come to it organically of your own volition and it's really hard to believe in like this that's lifestyle that you have are the principles that have been adopted all around you and in the course of working on the serious I thought a lot about Amish community make this decision themselves cuz as soon as they were like this is the way we do things you don't have a choice man do you think that you would be susceptible to moving into Utopia to following someone into one or starting on yourself great idea what this now yeah totally totally totally although I feel like I mean to dream of utopia it says it's like it's it's really really really really really compelling to think that you could live in a world that's better than the one that's around you like you have a choice by this this nation that you've been born into this world you've been born into but just feel sometimes I think like where could I turn like where could I go that would feel like peaceful and right to be able to carve out your own space is like incredibly intriguing and even though everything we talked about with Disney sounds really nefarious and scary now like I kind of want to believe it came originally from a good place I don't know fully Passaic you picking up all the time how to make money anyone sell property in like the movies weren't doing so great at a time and they like wanted to let you know make money out the theme parks but the singer in the creator of the shopping mall like he wanted to create the space that would be like pedestrian-friendly and he also felt like people would live there and there would be school Nobis Townsquare recreate Vienna and give it to the American suburbs and then also in the sixties he started like engineering downtown to be more like mall but it was his way of making peace and then he learned that downtown is not a mall and you can't just perfectly engineer it and he eventually grew to hate malls in like Rage Against the very very very very publicly like oh no what have I done and I keep comparing hold it in for the mall for the original vision for Epcot that ever dreamed of these little like perfect enclosed spaces are at this book and everyone pretty much everyone in this book stores in the sixties is a white man many of them are named Bob and I was thinking it's amazing what they managed to accomplish that they convinced Florida to just let them have their own separate government in Florida and like what if you didn't have to be a white man to do that if they had had like the best Minds from every different kind of person working it would have been so much bigger and scarier and better like I shiver to think what they would have invented if they had had like the smartest woman is eating out like they were really limiting it to this one population and I still accomplished a lot so they had opened it up they probably would have all of Florida by now would be Disney World it would be all happened so that my family can really have liked on vacation bonding together by what they did I think it's probably ultimately bad things that are bad and at least this is you know really fun to go on a ride I feel like you're in outer space you can have dinner in Canada without going to Canada has the best lasagna for dinner you do you need a reservation to that point like wow I really wish we had an unlimited the brain power because I kind of an idealistic point of view but it's like I wonder how truly freaking crazy we could have made this could have been really really really bad and I'm saying and now it's only like pretty bad insane what that what they've managed to pull off the scan they've got going you think like I guess when we were talking about things that all right auntie in the beginning and then they like mature into something where you see I feel like now he's got to the point where it is but they're running I think it's so scam they're running because they still are operating my face with the same set of laws that they were given in 1967 I think it's they would be so curious if they said actually like unconstitutional we are revoking all of them I wonder what to say when do because it would cost them so much more to run that Park what would happen to my family's Disney Vacation Club Points when they drop in. I don't know and my mom can't accept their tightly guarded I also think because you know why people keep trying to do these utopians I think that is really appealing to think that we can start completely clean slate instead of civilization developing as it has for all of human history kind of haphazardly like okay what if we now all that knowledge we have in a play in a really logical way and you need a confidence man or extroverted youngling excitement will probably it's very pretty far but I really believe something that's the thing I think if you if you feel you're selling people Ally it won't be as good but if you are crazy enough that you can convince yourself like I actually know how to run the perfect study then you can really get some people to believe you and try to make that City and I don't think it'll work well that's the thing I want to believe that we spent so long trying this and living together that we're learning lessons and that like we could maybe apply them and we could create a homes and communities and cities that are better be more terrible than those over and over and over again just like it's hard because people are I have a friend from the south who when I complain about things that are you know just Minor Medical claims he says you can complain about a birthday cake and I feel like there are always people out there who will complain about a birthday cake and that's why we can't have a Utopia my other favorite book but I read for the series at school dream in the biosphere by Rebecca Ryder also like gorgeous because it seems out and talks about the crazy story of Biosphere 2 and like all of the societal trappings around it oh by the way the funder of Epcot with Brothers with the funder Biosphere 2 if there was both the bass family yeah yeah there's so many crazy overlaps but the other thing was like people so after the biosphere experiment was over some of the people who have participated in it went around to like NASA and scientists who had done you know polar Expeditions and deep sea Expeditions and other places where people have been in confined space with each other and they were like is what happened in the biosphere all this infighting was it normal and everyone is like textbook they know it's going to happen it's called the 3/4 phenomenon and it just needs 3/4 through any Mission everyone just get that each other's throats like no matter how well they get along they separate into groups a lot of it has to do with like how they feel about mission control and when I feel like this mission is going but it's really really sad and even if they know it's coming and they can study it and like you just can't prepare for it we just fight that's not sad that is The Real Housewives of New York City to Mexico that's what happened I also I know that if I ever did anything like that I can convince myself of things so easily that I would absolutely be the one who's I think you should control is doing something I don't want to speak out of turn. I really think they're doing something or do you guys feel that way accidentally sowing Discord I know I'd be the one you could just be the confidence then you'd be home in about it I don't have any questions we supposed to get in the car we're going to Disney World soon all right thank you by the way for asking questions favorite episode of the season first episode was that Jamestown was I am just so interested in people who go somewhere where you came over didn't really know what they find but we're confident nothing whatever they found they be able to make a successful Town out of it and it's like oh no no no no no it's really hard to make a Town and that's what they found out I couldn't listen to stories of people trying and failing to create towns all day long specially when narrated by Avery the the Jamestown was like so upsetting so exciting and also just more upsetting that we don't talk about it you know I feel like especially in the Bay area that is like fail culture like Steelheart feel better if I keep failing I think my favorite episode is Biosphere 2 just because also I went there for this bullshit conference at spell I kept calling at the fire Festival conferences are we doing here what are we studying and they were like here are your rooms and they were like horrible there was no heat it was so so perfect that have that conference in the biosphere like Monument to failure I would also like out there in the middle of the desert until like I don't want to go see it if I have the chance to see it and like enjoy the knot story they're telling you like enjoy their Darkness to make it make sense and make it work but that is certainly my favorite they're all my I love them all but I'm going to ask you what would your Utopia look like sorry okay located in Orlando Florida I really don't know I have to say none of that utopians that were covered in the series as a securely appealed to me I think that I guess what's the difference between Utopia and Heaven it seems to be that Utopia is all about creating a perfect conditions for society to thrive and then maybe heaven is where everyone is actually happy but I don't think you could get that on Earth I don't even if she created the most perfect place I don't think people would live perfect lives there so you know I guess it would be like maybe on the beach but I don't have self at by Utopia that's going to launch in 2021 called Utopia and it's built by this development company these Developers and they're like this is a completely new concept and luxury living like you can buy a condo on this boat and it's like a normal condo except every morning you wake up in a new place and it's full of like of shopping malls and restaurants on you just like I know it's crazy it's really but it's really interesting because I feel like it like the vid Everest and watch the video for this this ship called Utopia it's totally crazy cuz it's full of all these people with European accents being like what is Utopian community has a billionaire but like how will they do their jobs how will they work how will they be in touch with their family and I presume that they're just going to have to like fly around and meet Utopia I'd like to fly back out to wherever they need to go and I think it really addresses this idea of like impermanence and Utopia like a question they'll end of the Utopia cuz you go there for a little bit at a time before it gets like boring and terrible and people start fighting and when you have like a like a limited when you can get it in a little bit that's what keeps it like that's funny so I feel like it's a Utopia limits thank you to Katy Weaver for joining me on this utopian evening and thank you to the 92nd Street y for hosting us this live event
