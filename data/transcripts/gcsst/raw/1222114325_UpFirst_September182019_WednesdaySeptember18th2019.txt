He may not have the support he needs and Parliament to help Shield him from prosecution what's the next shoe to drop here I mean what are you what what does happen next will first the final results have to come in and then Israel's president will give either Netanyahu organs the first crack at forming a coalition or he could push them to form a coalition togetherkingmaker here is a Victor Lieberman his right-wing party did Netanyahu Coalition last time this time he could tip the scales either way and he's calling for the two candidates to join forces in a Unity government so it seems like some kind of joint government appears to be the likely result they question is who gets to be number one that's on Yahoo or gaunt's what about the Arab parties the alliance of the Arab parties have how did they fare in this election what kind of power could they have an ending sharing power-sharing agreement the Arab party represents Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel were not talking about the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza who don't have voting rights in Israel and this party looks like it will emerge to be the third largest party in Government after Netanyahu and dances part if they support guns to form a government that could be the crucial push that God's needs to get that first crack in forming the government Netanyahu address that yesterday ina speech to his supporters have a listen what he saying there is no government can depend on the support of Arab lawmakers Who quotes support bloodthirsty terrorists so basically I'm saying these are pro-palestinian a legitimate political partners and he seems to be signaling to guns in a gun you can't get around me and it's on Yahoo to form a government do you need me and don't even think about relying on their party but this era parties already declaring a symbolic Victory its head could possibly be the leader of the opposition in Israel which would be historic historic first it would Grant him privileges like bodyguards like speeches prominent speeches in the Israeli Parliament and he's claiming it as a symbolic Victory against what he said was netanyahu's demonizing singling out Arabs in this election campaign is Daniel Estrin from Tel Aviv Pentagon officials have told NPR that are Ron set up drones and missiles at launch sites before Saudi oil facilities were attacked on Saturday the energy proving that has not been publicly released at this point but to defense Department officials say that intelligence agencies view the activity as circumstantial evidence that Iran launched the strike and Saudi Arabia Iran continues to deny any involvement with President Rouhani today saying that the accusations are a pressure tactic Ronnie also accused the United States along with a Saturday LED military Coalition of starting the war in Yemen meanwhile Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is headed to Saudi Arabia to weigh a response is following the story so what exactly do these images show well I'm told the images show the Iranians preparing these sites missile sites a drone sites that what they call is unusual activity in this area and they say it's circumstantial evidence it's not conclusive that these of missiles these drugs were used in the attack and this is standard surveillance and they are determined that this is somehow exceptional behavior and then they're linking it as evidence that a run wage this attack satellite imagery unusual activity at these locations so they are linking it to the attack on the Saudi oil facility but again there's still Gathering evidence they need a lot more they say before they can conclusively say that Iran was Behind These strikes a variety of different circumstances what are you hearing in terms of the options that the US could take in this particular moment reactions could be taken of course a couple of months back. President Trump authorize cyberattacks against the Run crippling their efforts to track shipping in the Gulf of you could do something like that again in the Cyber realm that's even more intense than than last time on their way to conduct some kind of strike against a run for its behavior in the gulf and then that's mission was scuttled in those plans were brought back I mean for there any cohesiveness to the Trump administration's approach to run right now the tax on a roni and radar sites and other facilities back in the spring after a round of course shut down that us drone he were ejected it saying at this he was told by a general that destroys could have killed stop to 150 orions now I'm told the Pentagon never gave him such a figure it was widely inflated like how concerned is centcom about about a possible conflagration between around in the u.s. troops in Iraq around could retaliate there 5,000 US troops there it always told back in May when secretary Pompeo went to Iraq it was a serious threat of a car bombs and others attacked by a roni and militia forces on those US troops that's precisely why the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went to Iraq so there's a great worry about that also retaliation against the US warships in the in the gulf and that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo now headed to Saudi Arabia so we'll see what comes out of that NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman thank you Authority revoked according to reports that's the order from the Trump Administration to the state of California today over its ability to make its own auto emissions rules that's right so from us 50 years the state of California has been allowed by the federal government to enforce more stringent environmental rules then apply in the rest of the country now reports from several media Outlets suggest that privilege could be coming to an end for the Washington Post and she joins us now thanks for being with us so the contacts here cars are the biggest source of greenhouse emissions in the US with that in mind how big a deal is this it's very significant it really could cause turmoil in the auto market because without a clear path of food sets the rules in this country for fuel efficiency and for what what's the mileage your car in light truck is supposed to have it makes it unclear what's the password for the cars and light trucks where are the car makers in in the standoff I mean are they with California are there with the Trump Administration that's part of the issue that there for automakers in July who struck a deal with California saying that they would adhere largely to what the Obama administration had sent its standards it's Ford Honda VW BMW of North America but a lot of the others have not taken aside and part of what the Trump Administration is trying to do is make it clear to the rest of the car makers that they should acknowledge that the federal government is the ultimate decider in this and therefore they should abide by whatever rules the administration sets which are expected to come out later this year they'll just irony here right I mean this this idea is not exactly in line with the Republican party's fundamental tenets of protecting states rights what what is the administrator reasoning their argument in your right been traditionally the GOP has emphasized State Prides is that you need to have a law of the land that applies to all 50 states and in this case they're 13 states and the District of Columbia that have agreed to adopt California's rules and so the argument there making is we have a national automatic can you can't have certain States requiring more stringent efficiency standards for cars and trucks while you have you know others who have looser standards and so that's where is California would argue that they would like to see that right I California would like to be a model for other states obviously in California has had the right to get this waiver for nearly fifty years what we have is you know a standard where where California has often been the driver of things like the catalytic converter you know things now we take for granted but we really were spurred by the fact that you had the nation's most populous states exacting more from Autumn Acres what's an except for it for the government of the state government California what's 3 course they're poised to go to court California's governor Gavin Newsom and it's attorney general Xavier Becerra have already said they'll Sue over there still be a battle over whether California has had its right to set a time standards has been affirmed multiple times by Congress can pursue that in this instance or whether the Trump Administration is right to save that at this point the federal government can prevent that Authority so we'll see how that plays out in the months ahead and whether this move that will be announced in the next day or two can take affect or whether it'll be halted by a catch Juliet eilperin with the Washington Post on NPR news we want to take another moment to tell you about someone who meant a lot to us and to so many other people Cokie Roberts was one of a small group of women who joined NPR near the very beginning and she helped build it into the organization that it is today we hear call them founding mothers Pokey died yesterday at the age of 75 after complications from breast cancer this amazing work at NPR for 10 years as a congressional correspondent before she joined ABC News where she went on to Anchor the Sunday morning show this week with Sam Donaldson you know everybody in town she New Politics backward and forward to say all of that is quite true but he misses the essence of koki she was a force of nature back to coverage of almost every major news story over the past 40 years and you can find kokis voice comprehensive plan that will provide basic health coverage. all Americans the part of the hearings have been about more than the sale of arms to around and the diversion of funds to the contrast the events surrounding the Iran-Contra Affair they've been about most likely that there are not enough votes in the House of Representatives to impeach the president cookie excelled in what was at the beginning of her career and almost exclusively male industry she sees every opportunity to lift up and encourage young people around her especially women over the last day I've seen so many friends and former colleagues from NPR and ABC sharing stories about how cookie would just drop him a note of encouragement out of the blue that meant the world to them for me personally she just always seem to know and I needed that extra nuts that said you are doing good work and it matters and it went beyond that here's our friend Nina totenberg casual friends we find Coqui visiting them in the hospital people in terrible Financial Straits would find her bailing them out and I I'm not sure how I would have survived the long illness and death of my first husband without Coqui she went with me to doctors meetings took notes and if an occasion she heard my voice faltering on the phone she would magically appear to bolster my spirits so I remember once mentioning to kokee that she was the subject of a story that I've written for my college Paper Co. Come to campus to give a talk I was covering it and years later when I mentioned this cookie said send me that story so I dug it up from the archive I sent it and she not only read it the next time we spoke to me to point of saying that she enjoyed it and you can imagine what it was like to hear that from her yeah she didn't want people to know she was sick she wanted to keep living as long as she could and that meant doing what you always did including spending time with her husband of 53 years Steve or two kids and her six grandchildren as well as her friends and she had so many even as her illness got worse just ten days ago cookies at the movies with me totenberg and Linda wertheimer there's Linda those people who listen to her on the radio will hear all of those things coming through and I hope that two people have been listening to her on the radio for years they have a strong sense of who she was and what she did what she did and how she did what she did and I think that they'll miss her as much as I do we will but there is a way to honor cocaine to remember what she was about do the work be fair be kind and lift each other up and that is a first for this Wednesday September 18th I'm Rachel Martin casts and we'd love if you would take a few minutes to write us and review us on Apple podcast international news wherever you go whatever you want it you can also hear podcast based on what you like download NPR one at the App Store parents have a lot of questions about screens and Kids when do I get him a cell phone kind of cell phone does he gets really hard to take away an iPad luckily and Paris like it has answers didn't like it from NPR's new episode on screen time by subscribing to life kit all guides
