rural all engines running welcome 15 minutes to the Moon from the BBC World Service the story of the people who took us to the Moon podcast from the BBC World Service supported by advertising best is Rice University football stadium in Houston the very place in 1962 that President John F Kennedy chose to make his famous speech rallying a nation to the great challenge of blinding people on the surface of the Moon before the end of the decade I can imagine the electric atmosphere here. Tell you I'm going to Siri Texas Sunshine with the stands towering above me to 40,000 expectant Americans and the Young Presidents where I am standing now on the 50-yard line to his Podium on this field and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space we mean to be a part of it we mean delete it we set sail on this new Sea Hunt speech set the world on course for the greatest Feats of exploration in the history of our species so for the last podcast now series Rice University was the perfect place to bring together a panel of people who will play their part in the boldest adventure of all time we choose to go to the Moon we choose to go to the home not because they are Geico best of our energies and skills because they're willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win welcome to 30 minutes to the Moon live in Houston from the BBC World Service on Kevin Fong rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy is just a few hundred meters from the football stadium where President Kennedy made his famous speech and it's 50 years with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landing on the lunar surface what we talkin about the mementos events of the 20th of July 1969 as well as the prospects for a return to the Moon open maps Journeys Beyond and of the great Fortune to be joined by a wonderful panel you slide Sabine Central 2B Endeavor of human space exploration Apollo Astronauts Walter Cunningham a full of fights pilots and member of the very first crew to fly into space aboard any Apollo vehicle Apollo 7 Jon Arryn Apollo flight controller missile man whose quick thinking help save more than one Apollo Mission John looks off the electrical and life support systems of the Command Module Jerry Griffin lead flight director for Apollo's 12:15 and 17 and who led the landings for two of those missions he'd like to become since director of the Johnson Space Center here in Houston and our final member of the panel is former astronaut Peggy Whitson the first female commander of the International Space Station at 665 days Peggy who spent more time in space any other American astronauts and she owns her doctorate in Biochemistry here at Rice University this is our panel that would touches get through tonight's with that's incredible speech made hair in September 1962 ants rice and I want to start with you Jerry can you remember where you were when you heard that speech where you learned about speech and what you thought about it yeah I had just gotten out of the Air Force and was trying to find my way to NASA because I knew that's where I wanted to be and when I heard President Kennedy say that we were going to do it in the decade of the of the 60s I thought to myself I don't know about that I'm not sure that's doable but when I became a part of it we just kept plugging away at it and he was right we made it Jordan Howard a uwell living in north Texas at the time about a million miles away from the space program what are you old memories that speech was your impression of it was actually further than that because I had just graduated from a very small school in a very remote area totally consumed by my studies so it hardly wretched only how much living in a cocoon try to find me to get the technical degree that I would wanted to pursue and you heard the speech to school to arms as it was to get to the moon before the end of the decade what did you think about what you think the chances of achieving guys when I was a practical thinker at the time and I was in the physics and I remember thinking he was overly optimistic because of all of the things that you had to be able to do to go and frankly I think it's one of the most amazing pieces of progress and objectives that we accomplished after announcing advance. But I figure you'll forgive me for not remembering the precise teach your toddler at the time but is an SMS to know what you mean the shuttle area that you sort least one attempt to reboot a lunar ambition the division for space exploration of the George W bush what you think's going so difficult to get us back to the Moon in successive presidencies one like you think we haven't been able to really engage ourselves in the way that we did with the project Apollo project Apollo I think I had that political will motivating it and and keeping it fresh the whole time plus a considerable amount of the national budget I think since that time we've obviously been somewhat hindered by not being able to spend that much money to try and get a program off the ground and the political winds from different administrations 10 to change those priorities over time and in a faster way than we can actually complete a project John F Kennedy Lord something but never been attempted before in Tampa so wide-ranging so difficult that are quite an entirely new approach so you people on the paddle with the people controlling its monitoring it troubleshooting it when it going to go to fix problems at the sum of you trust in your lives to it so I wanted to send to you now a Jerry has the flight to write to you what kind of like the conductor of his orchestra and to ask you what it was that enables you to build a team of this caliber people like John who are able to orchestrate this complex technology and make it work so he could have cheap your mission goals I have been a flight controller in Gemini and so when I was selected be a flight director for Apollo it was kind of natural except I didn't plan estimate any more like you say I was the director of the orchestra and listen to all the parts and make sure they made the right sound and no one to tone this one down and bring this up but it was a natural outgrowth I think of early high altitude high-speed flight test where our Mentor was guy named Chris Craft Chris actually developed his initial skills at Langley in high-altitude lightest and so if that's where he started as being an architect of Michigan troll and I can tell you they made a conscious decision to go out and find some young people Bob gilruth it was a center director at the time said we want enough of the old heads around to it going to keep things calm but we want some young people that don't have too many preconceived notions about spaceflight because nobody's ever done it and so I'd like to start with there and work on her brain so well anyway I can tell you in Mission Control it was The Way We Were wired it was in our DNA that we like the challenge it was I know you see pictures of us we look pretty serious at times but I would say it was fun fact it was a hoot we have a lot of fun and getting through even the tough faces but but that was the way mission control was and it was a team and it was we were obtained with the astronauts those of us in Mission Control all of our contractors universities play a big role as a shuttle astronauts on board that the success of the shuttle arguably the most complicated machine ever built I want what I want to know is what is it like to trust your life to something that you yourself cannot be in control of you cancel the moving Parts what is it like to trust in a system like at work and having people that can provide that input from from the youngest engineer up to the most experienced makes you able to trust in that team it was it was definitely risky and in some senses but it was the one in 68 what the engineer said at the end of the shuttle program was the risk of loss of life for one of those flight a woman 68 chance of catastrophic failure with the loss of the crew and the vehicle is there about what sounds to me like a very high risk of potential catastrophic failure of the mission but but you didn't think of the risks in those precise terms but they must have been much how I what was your attitude was the risks of the floods during Apollo missions there's no question that over the years the safety and the attitudes we had had changed but also the people that we were taking up that we're flying in later spacecraft I had a different attitude to when I was there starting in 1963 we were all fighter pilots most of test pilots and we were excited as all get-out to have the opportunity to fly a mission like that we wanted to fly the first mission and we want to find the landing on the moon and I don't remember anyone in those days being overwhelmed by the risk of his own life as a as a fighter pilot you always understand that's a possibility but you also develop the kind of attitude that says it's not going to happen to me there's a tiny little bit of you that knows that you might be wrong John now you were a flight controller and so you'll experience the risk is it slightly abstract his nose direct disposal Peggy's what it's like to make decisions and take risk of other people's behind. But I wanted to put it was like for you sitting in that seat in Michigan troll as a flight controller to make decisions upon which other people's lives depend I got introduced to risk right up front as first night I served on the Apollo program with the night of the fire so I was introduced to risk and very Vivid way my approach to risk being a flight controller was that the best way to prepare yourself to handle the unforeseen he still is still learning everything you can about the design the environment you're in the operational situations that were in like the launch phase and be there and feel prepared that if the worst thing happens that you that you can act and you can come up with the answer when baby there's not a dancer that is the way I feel comfortable walking into the room to do a launch phase knowing the high-energy situation that's involved because we will come to some of your stories of knowing what to do when the impossible has happened to Lisa about the need for teamwork but won't every account of Apollo astronaut selection is one of the Fish Company that was between you as my co-pilot and we're ready competitive people just tell me what it was like to try and put a sign that sense of competition and into work as a team I guess within projects Apollo well I have to confess to you we weren't trying to put aside competition we were trying to make sure that we can operate and operate decently back in our time while we had that individual attitude that fighter pilot service fire department that we had in those days when we became part of a crew was it was two of weather was three is the same as military staff working together in the same spot or not in the same group of people you were fine with believe me we all had commitment for the total success of those missions and we thought it was probably easier if there was just one of us involved in it cuz everybody tried to work together I just feel fortunate to have lived when I did and be able to join that group you flew a time of the astral call Lyft Berry difference but you don't get to become a NASA rational without having competed in the first place tell me about how you balanced the competitive spirit that gets you into the astronaut Corps against the need to be the best team players you can possibly be once you get there well it's it was really important question what when I read the selection board we actually change the emphasis of the crew members we were looking for we had thousands of applicants that were technically competent and we started looking more for those that got the box checked from the report card that says play well with others because for long-duration mission that had much more of an emphasis for us but yes there there was always the competition of thousands of other applicants to get in I think once we were in obviously everyone still wanted to be the first in their group to fly but there was much more of a camaraderie and team spirit still toilet for me so into our Illusions for for some questions so it will take one or two questions do you have any questions from the audience tool yes my name is Ernie Seifert live in Friendswood south of here the question I have is is 50 years later we've got a lot more technology I hear you hear people saying you've got more technology in your watch then you had going to the Moon is that going to make it easier for us to get there this time or do we have more hurdles to overcome because we got too much technology in the way thank you but I question I'm going to touch of June 4th at 1:20 to 700 desk managing the environmental control it and watch the pool systems the electronic systems aboard the Apollo spacecraft what what do you think about a spacecraft now this is what it was like and you will day the main differences the the technology is much improved there's a but there's a much-improved foundation to build and the Next Generation systems on there's a much better way of including artificial intelligence and to those Technologies we did not have the artist of the year computer technology to automate it with slide rules and Big Chief tablets almost stand up that's that's the primary thing that's changed but the problem hasn't changed with the basic problem of how do you know how bad it got power and how haven't been Varga no control and thermal control and all that does the fish and chips the same but the third one caution that I would apply that I found this we have evolved into waiter Space Station just because you have the technology to make a system complicated doesn't mean you should will take one more question from the audience here and we are on the right in the green shirt secondary thank you visit the current public Insight NASA works for you think it is I think that's his biggest hold back is well I think NASA has to have obviously as you mentioned you've got to have that political will and and needs to be followed up with the money but the other thing that is most important I think in our future development of future exploration is the fact that we're going to have to change how we do our processes to some degree in order to do it and shorter periods of time doing it with International partners and with these new commercial providers if we can set up collaborative work that will allow both the government and the those collaborators to benefit from those experiences then I think we're going to be able to do things faster and I think that'll be a huge step up in the future and I think that we are really on a precipice of change we have that potential that exists right now and if we can push hard enough politically with enough money I think we can really start and get back there where we need to be cuz I just asked you to identify yourself to this what you do and how old you are my name is Jason I'm 14 I love space and I probably think right now that our kids don't you know my father for him it was always space you know it was whatever was in too but now you don't see that at all like kids do you say NASA now it's more than you were holding not something you think that's cool or you're actually hoping for go to the moon or anything it's just something oh yeah that's a thing thank you so much for your question and that'll be the end of the questions for now they'll be more opportunities to ask questions later thank you so much for your contributions that is being on the final 13 minutes at the sent to the Moon with Neil Armstrong himself said was rampant with unknowns and it was a combination all the hopes dreams and efforts of a Nation poop the previous decade so that's just his some of the mission old you are now about 4 minutes away from Landing because it's this order that gave us the idea for the series in the first place that sound is unique it, be mistaken for anything else and so we just going to play you a clip sounds like an father is going to go for Landing restaurant 3006 37° Rodger Rogers 1202 wake happiest 543 status 3015 that is lost voices where Apollo 11 flight director Gene Kranz and Capcom Charlie Juke just 2 and 1/2 minutes before touchdown now I'd like some of that Pamela Sue I actually listening to The O'Jays live in the mission operation control room to put themselves back in the moments put us in that room well I was plugged in at the flight director console James actually running the the team then for one thing is very quiet it was very disciplined room most of the time anyway but it was extremely quiet that day we had been very close to landing on Apollo 10 and intentionally didn't but we had down in 47000 Ft but at that point we came back up and running food with the mothership and came home it was a dress rehearsal in the point I want to make him mad is that until that Final Phase we had done it all but from their arm from about 47,000 feet on down is brand new and the tension was there but everybody was ready and it was calm I think confidence until got a little bit squirrelly on fuel there he we made a 60-second call and then we made a 30-second I know about to make a 10-second call when he touched down and and shut the engine down and they went back later and calculated they think they hadn't about 17 seconds of fuel remaining that was by far the closest we got in any of the landings to running out of fuel but it was a momentous step but there was still no celebration not yet on you with that you're plugged in as a flight controller for Apollo 11 monitoring fuel systems what's it like for you and in what sounds like a few seconds bull The Landing I had the best seat in the house my responsibility was to watch the command service module which was orbiting the Moon 60 miles overhead with doing just fine and then the driver begin they were subject re concerned about we're going to be long there was the alarms were going off the large but got off and I got to watch that I knew enough about everybody's position to know what they were working why are they were working and what they were saying what they were doing and Dad he got down to the real terminal phase and then the concern became king fuel it was it was a Dromedary point out nothing like any simulation we had ever had all the we had hundreds of simulations of just that face the touchdown happened there was a sense that were just kind of a hush in a sense coming with a room that was what kind of awkward and then and then there was a reaction almost to start chores and then we were reminded we just touched down we may have to lift back off what's all about that's all pay attention to bestest I got to watch that from the vantage point of not having to suffer the drama look to watch it now what for you of course these are not just the crew but but your colleagues people you've trained alongside your fellow astronauts what was that like for you listening to that on the loop seeing how much trouble they were almost getting into those of us that already flown on a pile of we were very much aware everybody flight crews in those days everybody was aware of the kind of exposure you were at done a lot of simulations some of the simulations we carry down to it to failure so you kind of get used to it but those of us at that time that are flown earlier and it we were there listening to the crew coming down and I we might have been more impacted medley on it then the crew because the crew was involved in doing it that means he had to log those things but you don't want to ever get hung up on what is going on here to keep operating I was very much impressed when I touch down or less than 20 seconds of fuel remaining with the same time it's hard for the public to understand that unless they were really ordered by the ground which is what they talked about doing they would have continued final of the farther they were aware pretty much all so as long as they felt like they had a controlled variable to a board they would keep doing it so I was I was thrilled to death that they had what it took to keep pushing to it thank you both now as we all know I'm someone old united safety but let's remind ourselves of that moment the game now Jerry you were breathing again but it wasn't time for Peter Pan cigars out at tell me why some people that said the dust will be so fine and so thin or they'll be a crush on your break through it you could turn over or start to turn over so we had to be ready for an immediate aboard on the action stage the second stage of the two and we also then had a what we called a T1 stay no stay that was about a minute after launch in the flight director of wood pole all the positions if we were still okay after sitting on the surface then they could do some additional powering down there is a silence at right after touchdown and then a little bit of rumbling in the room. No yelling or standing up or anything like that and cran said Okay hold it down and it and it went right back down to zero so it was exhilarating but the mission wasn't over in those days they were landing on another body in the universe and so little was known about it and it really came down to the field there at the end we now talk about going to Mars and the public may not realize that we know probably a hundred times the thousand times more about Mars and Mars surface today that we knew about the moon in those days so I'm absolutely amazed with how much we know about Mars today it's a six and a half hours later Neil Armstrong opens the hatch climbs down the ladder with an estimated 1 billion people on earth watching or listening is the mission with some of the most famous words of all time call San Fran the picky you are 9 years old that you have a memory of this tell me about that my parents let us stay up late now it's big deal they actually I remember being in my pajamas and watching on a black and white screen as As Nails took that first step onto the moon was very memorable I'm not sure that at 9 you can really understand the significance of it but you know it was obvious that this was something special and unique and maybe wanted to be an explorer to you are in your career is nationals about Russell and on Space Station became one of the most experienced Spaceball cuz I guess the whole time by Swoope doesn't quite cover it doesn't tell me I mean it's the most dangerous thing we do is place explain to me why it says this well I honestly we're we're basically in a spaceship built for one and so we have all those life support systems inside we have a suit that protects us but maybe not as much as a spacecraft would but we we are out there and we're working with the pressure of the suit against the pressure this suit that pressure protects us but it also makes it much harder to work in that suit so it's just it's one of the most I would say difficult from a mental and physical perspective but at the same time that's what makes it one of the most special part of the job of being an astronaut what was your memory of seeing Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the moon has it ever came down the ladder and planted his foot personally what it meant to me I felt you know kind of a cold chill kind of come up on me and cried just weld up I mean that you're going to get me out of going here but that the pride of the whole team the 40,000 probably felt the same way and then afterwards I started thinking about what he meant to the country you know in the late 50s annoy 1950s I grew up in the Duck and Cover training Cold War was raging the mood and morale of the country was down that you know where on the engine and proudest wasn't perhaps what it should be and then I think that was a watershed event for how people felt about himself to be Americans from that moment on we were not only caught up with the Soviets with respect to Space Race we have made it a leap ahead Jerry you're in Mission Control Apollo 11 are on the surface of the Moon at what point can you is a flight director relax and say that's it jobs done Peggy said about being this spaceship for one I was always nervous and Evie Ace there were a lot of single point failures that and we didn't like single-point failure as we always tried to drive them out of the system but you put a person in a suit pressurized suit you can snag it hurt it hook it do something that they could be a really bad now the Apollo 11 crew didn't get very far from the lunar module later and we had people miles away from the lunar module and I don't know I was on every time you open the hatch it kind of bothered me you got close the door you know I'm pressurize this thing and get it going but that moment was historically met a lot more to me than it did in in the moment when he stepped out now much of the series has explored the Jeopardy of the Apollo 11 Landing but none of the Apollo missions after that what was out there problems by way of example to of intimately involved in the next mission Apollo 12 just four months after the first moon landing and that mission was struck by lightning very shortly after launch now I'm going to ask Jerry to put me into picture this is a Polish while launching and all hell breaks loose tell me what happens at 12 was my first time to be on duty for a Saturn V launch which was an experience in itself about 35 seconds after liftoff all of a sudden our data on all of our computer screens froze in jumbled it didn't make any sense in it and they stopped Pete Conrad was commander and almost immediately he started calling out the master caution and warning lights which were essentially all of them on it a panel about this big my first thought was we met at toeboard we were still gaining altitude so I said let's keep going and about that time I said to me, what do you see I join you said why tell him to try xte talks I like to John-John it stood up and looked at me and I said what and he said he repeated it at Sea Dogs so I turned to the Capcom who was now looking at me and I said Capcom SCE to aux and he looked at me with this what and what do you want to add me to call and called it up to Conrad and he said try SCE to aux and repeated it SCE to aux what the hell is that and so we had this Comedy of Errors running around through all these hoops but albean a renter matcha pilot new for the switch was the John have made the call on it was right in front of him anywhere from the primary to the auxiliary position when that happened we got all the data back in the control center and John at that point stepped in and said tell him to reset the fuel cell flight Capcom reset the fuel cells and Albion was going to do that maneuver hey there were three switches and he was very slow and doing it he told us both later they didn't like that idea that you start fiddling around with the power fuel cells produce power and he said he didn't just didn't feel right doing that so we put on one and John said he's got one coming to get the other two so he did and what it did it restored all the power back in the spacecraft this is one of the remarkable stories of Apollo 26 years old in your first job out of college I guess do you know that this is the right things to apologize was being struck by lightning every lights on the console is on saying you should really important that you say no make this design switch to SCE to aux how do you know that the first thing that I noticed about the data and listening to the wall crew was reporting and by the way we didn't know it was as lighting their that part. We just do it at that I sense there's probably a major Brown out in the power system is going on in spacecraft the thing that I saw I realized quickly that I had seen it before Zoom back in time one year that was sitting in mission control with that same console in the middle of diet after a long day of pad test and they made an error in this sequence would need this is all alive spacecraft they made an error in the sequence and set up the condition by all the lights came on that they could happen I just happen to be the right person on the right console at the right time to see a pattern that I had seen before that it was a pattern I had memorized your earlier but totally forgot about it but what happened was this lightning strike kind of tripped out one circuit and that simple switch to a from SCE to aux put in a second circuit that meant the whole machine continue it did they try to get to it because I knew the date it was fake was I looking at the cars or was I looking at the effect that's always the first thing you have to figure out once you troubleshoot something so it's as we got it Dogzilla reading the data Came live and I said reset the fuel cells okay the next bicycles get into even bigger trouble Apollo 13 on his way to the moon was an explosion which triples its life support and and its source of Power with a very real risk of seeing astral creeping Marine in space now quotes one of the things that really struck me when when we interviewed you for the podcast series was that you or your statement that nobody seriously expected us to complete all the flights to the Moon without losing at least one crew during a flight when you became aware of the Apollo 13 questions did you think that this might be a crew that you were going to lose in Flight function question but it wasn't an official kind of policy that said we're going to lose one time I was talking about the cruise themselves everybody thought we had up most confidence which we did we had self-confidence what have you been turn conversations even I'm just flying with some broken the guys are in the cruise well maybe I'm the only ones going to say is time but we all thought that they would probably be some loss of at least one crew in there and it would just take another mission to do it and it has to do with the attitude that you have when you're in this kind of a position and I'd have to say this to probably every one of us that might have a little talk from time to time and sell we're going to lose some crew nobody thought it was going to be there and everybody realized there were things that that could cause it but they all had the confidence same confidence that I had while it's Ron Isley had his if we get an emergency here will be able to handle it now that the correct probably not but it's the way we felt about it's an attitude I'm Cherry Apollo 13 oil accounts was chaotic really from the moment you have that problem with the explosion than you're losing almost every critical system on board the vehicle and they're headed away from 24000 miles an hour or so tell me about what it was like to try and manage that chaos I had just gotten off shift and I I tell Gene Kranz happen to be on shift when the tank exploded told him I turned over a perfectly good spacecraft to him and he blew it up but actually came back in the room that same time John did 40-50 minutes probably after the explosion and I was out playing a softball game so I might have to come get me but the room was, it was not chaotic there were more people in the room bath time I got there as when they made the call to get over into the lunar module and use it as a Lifeboat and I remember about 13 probably the most fortunate thing that happen if it had to happen it happened at the right place we still have the lunar module had that happened after they had separated the lunar module and landed it was curtains it wouldn't work we could have probably gotten Swaggart home but that would be about it so it it was checked in and one thing else and I'll make this quick one of the secret maybe the primary secret of Apollo was the training and I am amazed at the Fidelity of simulations we had 50 years ago when I think about it we had two astronauts in one building and a simulator we have the control center and another building we were connected the data that we saw inside the control center look just like a real flight and the simulation guys were in between us and they could throw in failures and they did and they would drive us to our knees and we sometimes have to board and sometimes we wouldn't but eventually what we did through that process is the training taught us not only about the systems it also taught us how to face a serious problem so I think that was one of the big things that we had to do in 13 there was was really stay focused on you yourself play a key role in the rescuing of the Apollo 13 mission just tell me you'll Recollections of that when the problem happened I was home I didn't know it was going on and I got a call it's a John Deere you got a problem out here and they're chasing it try to diagnose it in there chasing it convinced this is some kind of instrumentation problem this is a bunch of bad measurements coming down the spacecraft so I said what what kind of consoles and read me some measurements cuz I new laws Electronics it that aggregated those kind of measurement said they read it to read them out to me and so will you read me this here and I'm about to get rid of these and I said that is not an instrumentation problem that's a real problem with that I'll be right there I did walk I would then I thought on the way driving into the control center I ran through my mind what could that be in what so forth so what's in the control center and look at what people were trying to diagnose a Chase and then we begin the process of making the inevitable call that you had to turn the Command Module off very traumatic call to make because I had never been done before Norbit with we didn't we didn't we didn't know how to really to turn it back on but it was time to start the troubleshooting and and focus on the Lifeboat and you got going to fix this you got to turn it off and save the batteries because read to get back in a bit center of the Earth by some miracle we're going to need those almost everything that you've been talking about here about the problems with their 13 or 12 or what have you let me see me unique now but at the time those of us that were training for all those missions sometimes backup what have you there was always in my opinion they build in a capability to adjust and handle it at the same time it was always that piece of that that said if we can't get this done we've got the ground down there they can try to do it for example Apollo 13 I lived across the street from the Johnson Space Center and when I heard TV powering it I was getting ready to go to bed I put my clothes on when I cross one in the mission control when I got there I was listening to Jack swigert who was the last minute substitute replacement on their on Apollo 13 I said down there I stayed there for about 15 minutes I listen to what was going through Jack and the air to ground the other guys are in the lunar module already trying to open it up and get sentenced to cover for them and I went home went to bed and I went home went to bed cuz I felt like they had done I was on the track for everything they could possibly do and then from that time on it was going to have to be a function of analyzing other things and it's neffex Orient House subject for another podcast series best but an incredible story of Triumph through the whole the Apollo program we didn't actually lose a crew in flights and you yourselves know Croatian last Notes 3 through the shuttle area we lost two vehicles and that cruise you yourself in the Explorer Corps when we lost Columbia in 2003 I would still ask we know the risks we know the numbers mathematically but when you experience a risk of close hand like that does it modify you will have to choose to the risks but I just might it's going to have an effect obviously knowing people that you've lost makes a huge difference I Thinkin maybe how you perceive it but I think I knew there was risk before I was at Nasa I was still here at Rice University in my PhD post doctoral phase and that's when Challenger happen and so even then I knew there was risk and maybe I didn't understand the my new show of how we got into that problem but obviously when I got to know so that's one of the things that the manager you learn and they teach us about the Challenger accident because they want us to not fall into the same traps that that management fell into as part of that disaster to risk is part of the job I think you can't deny that it's there but I think the fact that we have a day of remembrance every year to actually acknowledge it and understand and it in and think about it so that we don't repeat it is important now the United States is of course thinking of going back to the moon in the near future but put us with her and Foles a huge amount of risk with told about a + 12 + 13 + 15 itself alcohol blonding 16 17 word straightforward the whole Endeavor of humans face expression is always fraught with danger we going to take on these missions into the future is society as a whole prepared to accept those risks wolves as my personal opinion is that today I don't believe that the public at large is oriented towards accepting risk physical risks like this as we used to be that's not the total solution but it does change a lot about the reaction to it Cherry we want to go back to the Moon you've been posting operation to go to the Moon once before want to we need to do today to get back there a consistent finding is extremely important and we got to get I think ultimately we going to have to have the Democrats and Republicans talking to each other in Apollo we had three presidents two of them were Democrats and one Republican and with all the problems we had the fire Apollo 13 and so for it we said let's go let's keep going and we had a commitment it's been fifty years since we've flown in deep space and I can tell you it's different different than Earth orbit but we've seen some. Holmes in our efforts to return and reinvigorate desire to go back to the moon and back among deep space exploration do you think this coward initiative has a real chance I think it has more of a chance than it then it has maybe on some of the previous instances and largely that's because I think we have a demonstrated capability as with International Partners you know 20 years of human presence in space on the International Space Station is not trivial and it there were lots of hurdles in that process but I think the important thing is that we've also added in the commercial providers for cargo and hopefully crew in the near future and if we can keep adding and more and more commercial providers to give us have them help us get that Innovative flavor back into NASA a little bit faster you know to make things happen a little faster than I really do think we have it a chance but we do need that that political will and consistency with the funding to go with it thank you we're going to have to move on to our last set of questions from the audience now so if there are any questions in the audience I'd be very happy to take them there is a lady in the middle of the field Road Apex. So I think you by name is Laura's lean I live here in Houston and mr. and you spoke at the big public movement of the landing on the moon and wondering if there are smaller and more private moments either in the build-up to Paul at 11 or Peggy that you serve taken from that store everyday moments when you thought this is NASA this is what we're about this is everything that's a good combination or iFit this is the good but I have to admit public now the team that I worked with in addition to what I thought was the pilot in which I thought was the best team in the World of Warcraft I found another one and that's the one who built the Space Shuttle the day that the first time will you have tried to launch the space shuttle to orbit we didn't go to computer to say that it did not want to talk about where were fortune we were able to sort that out of that very short. Of time and then two days later we watched some very brave men on a man vehicle for the first time that was a great achievement that the building of the avionics system for the space shuttle NASA can put together great teams and that's what I take great pride in that I've always said I think NASA's motto should be making hard things look easy because we do it routinely you know little instances you know broken toilets or there's big instances we had a torn solar array in it it was a heroic effort you know of multiple teams working 24/7 to come up with a solution to fix a torn solar rain and in 4 days it was done it's just amazing to me that you know so many people can can split off these problems and work them and Tack him come back together and that teamwork it's just phenomenal it's makes me proud all the time I think everybody knows we had a tragic fire on Apollo 1 and 3 of our good buddies were were killed in that and right after that before Apollo 7 which was the first man flight I was made a flight director and I think one of the proudest moments I had was when 7 worked and Splashdown in Walking Amazon that flight is one of the most important flights that we ever had because had it not work the program was over and the Apollo 7 solution put us on our way it worked and well done thank you Dad we will take one last question here actually just that yes thank you very much this your name my name is Holly Maddux rookie on cancer research Express it's a true privilege listening to such a group of pioneers and heroes thank you very much here's my question being out there the tree in outer space is probably the biggest change of vantage point of human being can experience what does that do to the human mind what does being out in space do to the human mind I woke up to people on the phone with qualify to tell us hey water water the effects of you float in space more than any other American that the biggest message the biggest lesson I think that you take away is this perspective this perspective of what our planet is we're up there orbiting the Earth trying valiantly to recreate the life-support system in a very mechanical way that's provided by this planet below and that the atmosphere is so thin and it just gives me a huge appreciation for the fact that spaceship earth needs to be taken care of it cuz there's only one atmosphere and we're all going to eventually be sharing all of that but the other part of the perspective it provides is when you look out to the stars and you can see so many stars you know thousands and thousands and thousands and knowing that there's billions of other galaxies just like this one and that perspective goes from you know thinking how important our planet Earth is and having that perspective the importance of this place and who we are and then you know of being just less than a grain of sand on the beach of this Cosmos it's pretty amazing perspective but you so much of God's brings out discussion to an end thank you the rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy here in Houston for hosting us and of course a message thank you turn out fantastic panel Peggy Whitson Jerry Griffin Jon Arryn and Walt Cunningham and that's how very lost 13 minutes to the Moon podcast for us it's been a voyage of Discovery and it's Ivan rights that is so disgusting the United States looking for the people who made projects Apollo happen and they gave us a chance to bring their epic story to audiences across the world old and Miu I'd like to think how many contributors play my head in the audience who so generously gave up their time to help tell this incredible story is being a labor of love for me and my Brilliance producer Andrew Luck by you and Siri set aside Remy's a particular thanks to sue Nelson who's here with us in the audience today and who opens so many tools throughout this documentary series and finally to those of you listening to the public house thank you for sticking with us throughout the series on Kevin's phone this has been 13 minutes to the Moon live in Houston some of the others you've helped make this podcast possible huge thanks to the Johnson Space Center oral history project for the archive material we've heard throughout the podcast and of course to NASA is what is the series and series French mission control the producer Chris Browning and assistant producer Madeline Finley where it's only grateful to Hans Zimmer bleeding fingers music for creating a theme music hope you had a chance to look at the fabulous videos and photos on my website that's BBC World Service.
