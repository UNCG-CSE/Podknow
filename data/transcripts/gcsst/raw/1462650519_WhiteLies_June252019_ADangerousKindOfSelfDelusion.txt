if you came this morning hoping to hear a message of Hope on one many ways I will have to discourage you it's July 1964 this recording is from the All Souls Church in Washington DC this is Jim read delivering his final sermon there were many people who seem to feel that once we'd had the March on Washington and once we had the Civil Rights bill things were just inevitably going to be easier but somehow we done it and I can say to you only that I think that this is the most dangerous kind of self-delusion did we not in any way done it and adjust to the extent that we think we have we're going to be dismayed when we find out that we have not just to the extent that we permit ourselves to be emotionally dismayed we ourselves as individuals will in some small way add to this thing that is known as the backlash which is real and I feel in many ways growing and in many ways possibly stronger than we surmise as yet 8 months after he delivered the sermon Jim Reed went to Selma Alabama to show support for the Voting Rights Campaign there less than 24 hours later he was attacked on the corner of Washington Street by group of men have you ever met before Reeve died two days later in a Birmingham Hospital we focused all this time I'm trying to figure out what happened on the street corner that night. Understand this brief moment of violence and what came after and we did that which I done Witnesses we didn't buy the attackers we untangled the history from the mythology to get the true story of what happened to Jim Reed but there is no justice here at the end of our story at least not in the way we're taught to think about you know Redemption and is Jim Reeves said in his sermon it would be a dangerous kind of self-delusion think otherwise to the question is once you've called Ally Ally what does it mean to live with the truth play NPR This is white lies I'm Andrew Beck Grace and I'm chip Brantley Jim I'll just say right off would not have wanted to be remembered as a martyr as profound and is moving and as important as the story of his death was Jim was being lost this is Ron Engle can jam work together at All Souls Unitarian Church in Washington DC in the early 1960s in the last years of Jim's life Ron was among his closest friends I think it's so interesting it's something we've thought a lot about this idea that Jim is not a real person for many Americans who noticed or he simply it person who fulfilled a calling whose death is is so much more important and memorable than his life I'm not saying that's what I think I'm saying that's the story that gets rejected so much and he has been seen as a martyr in this country for longer than he was alive and how how then do we go back and create him as a real person I mean salsa philosophical question about storytelling I'm just curious I thought about it I think you have to go back and put gym in context Fortune read was transformed into a martyr he was a real person husband the father of four is born on January 1st 1927 in Wichita Kansas was an only child we have seven years old the dust storm swept through the Midwest and Jen was bedridden with a terrible bout of rheumatic fever the wind blew duster the Cracks around windows and doors and into the bedroom where Jim Lahey does mother may stay by his bedside dripping wet cloth over his mouth to help him breathe the family move to Casper Wyoming when Jim was 15 a few years later he met Marie and they were married college at st. Olaf and then Seminary Princeton Jim had been a Pious child Presbyterian Destin for the pulpit but after Princeton he began to question is fake and a questioning let him to the Unitarian Universalist and ultimately to the position of assistant minister at All Souls in DC All Souls was one of the most important churches in the denomination and his job there was enviable but in the last two years of his life gym became Restless he felt the comfortable position at All Souls was in conflict with the values he preached and in the turbulence of the early 60s the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement he saw growing inequality and Injustice all around it so we made a surprising decision to leave All Souls and seek a new position where you could engage more directly with the community outside the church has walls running go how to stack of letters in the written to him during this time here is what he was looking for a church he had trouble communicating to the US Department of the ministry that the of what kind of church he wanted to serve and he wrote the department of ministry assures me they will get my name on list of desirable churches if there is anything I'm not interested in it is joining the list of those looking for desirable churches what the hell is that a desirable church I mean here was the the Crux of the matter where we serious about what kind of a religious and political Community we were seeking to the nurture after months of searching the really any church with its institutional structures and administrative responsibilities would interfere with a community organizing he felt called to so we took a job in Boston with the American friends service committee working on low income housing issues out of a storefront office in the city's majority-black Roxbury neighborhood it was important to Jem to live in the same place where he worked to raise his family there to send his kids to the Local Schools okay for here's one about when they were looking for the house this is the fall of 1964 it took me many days of looking to find this house it is 3 floors 11 rooms and full basement plus a vacant lot across the street it was difficult to find this house almost no one wants to encourage you to move here one lady asked me if I was crazy when I told her I really wanted to move into the neighborhood then he goes on to say the children are in school and in general happy John wanted to help to integrate his class some gallon Washington wanted to know if I really wanted my children to go to school with Negroes and I said yes of course all children are lucky who integrate schools Maria's fine busy getting the house in order I am faced everyday to stretch my mind there are new problems new ideas and new experiences to deal with I have seized the bull by the horns I am doing what seems important and let the damn Torpedoes come wow that's something else it is it's a really I feel that I must say on a personal level like having worked in the story about him for so long this is kind of first time I've ever felt in his presence to some extent it's a it's a kind of a peculiar feeling really Andy that's that's that let me just go on here is Jim we have a challenge to meet as a family we are together sharing and what I think will probably be one of the most significant times in our lives we are all amazingly well but I am spending more time with the family than ever before we have finally got our ping pong table and Marie John and I play regular we are resuming our Friday night birthday Festival we have a cake candles someone tells us about a person we admire and we sing Happy Birthday wow we think of you and are grateful for your friendship across the miles Jim Murray and the Indians wow yeah so that's that was the joke that you agreed that we all go there you are do you think the cars with your husband came to Selma was worth it in 1965 speaking to the Press from the hospital in Birmingham answer that for myself I can only answer for Jim that any consequences that might occur did embarrasses Marie gathered her children and moved almost immediately back to Wyoming her family and Jen's family we're both in Casper and she would need help with her four children how many Jen had become a martyr for racial equality is a flash point in the Civil Rights Movement but for Marie Jim was a husband and a father and a partner and so is Jen's death became a public spectacle Marie chose to keep her grief private just not spoken to the Press since that brief and painful interview for the Birmingham Hospital on March 10th 1965 we knew all along we needed to talk to the Reed family we wanted to finish our reporting first so we can tell them everything we've learned so we got in touch with Jim and Maria's daughter Anne would become a kind of spokesperson for the family explained and what we've been working on and she said she talked it over with your mom and the rest of the family when we heard back from her a few weeks later she said she felt uneasy about doing an interview over the years Jim's life have been consumed by the story of his death and Marie it stayed away from all that and now two guys from Alabama she never met before wanted to come talk with her about it if Marie was going to talk to us we would need to come out to make the case in person to the whole family this is Marie Reeves home in Casper Wyoming the same How She Move the family into in the spring of 1965 there's a large framed portrait to jump on the wall as you walk in the front door we all sit in the living room John timorese oldest child who was 12 when his father died is here with his wife his two children and grandchildren and Aunt is here from California with her son he makes us a special breakfast the Reed family tradition what they called roll up pancakes then after breakfast in an hour visiting returns to us and agrees to be interviewed once again and the six months that we were in Boston was the happiest that we had because Jim was just getting started on a job and he had had Teddy was going to be on this committee or the house and we had lots of time together and Sundays we would after church we would would have a picnic lunch somewhere we could go someplace where we've never been before but it was a happy time is that hard decision for you to come back here at it it just seemed obvious it was a no-brainer it was what I thought I needed to do and to have my children safe and my main concern wear for my four children and he we wear such a short time in Boston that I have failed no real ties so family was in my oming and Mom and Dad re-bath lost their only son and so I wanted my children to be there for grandparents so I know a lot has been made of his decision to go to Selma and I wonder if you can kind of talk about what you remember about that I know it's probably hard memory but Bloody Sunday watching the TV just a horrible feeling to see what was going on and saying all that taking place and so then of course when dr. King was asking for anyone to come down and help and members of the clergy he just looked at me and needs to so I have to go after looking at what we saw on the screen and you're going to go down into that situation I still have to go so I packed a bag and took it in Monday evening to Logan Airport so I'm always angry I was upset that he wanted to go but not angry and what do you remember of the University Hospital in in Birmingham they provided bed for me to sleep in when I was ready so of course they they came and said that you know there was no hope so I run into cm and allies for some reason and I thought later why didn't you just go and hug him and whatever but I just looked at him and know that he wasn't going to live Marie was in Birmingham Jim's father President Johnson and Lady Bird so yellow roses to them at the hospital after Jim died the president sent a government airplane to take them back to Boston so how are you this is an read my memory is when my sister and I we're sitting with you Mom and we were you were telling us that Dad had been hurt and that never ever remember you saying that he was killed but I remember you saying he was hurt and that he would never be coming back but I remember Karen and I being upset and I remember someone was holding Steven I can't remember who had Stephen in his arms and I remember John was very upset and upstairs in his room and I do remember that memory that it was something big that happened something larger and important and I remember feeling as I got older I remember feeling somehow and understanding why you had to be so courageous and strong but then also wondering that we could have with there was an absence of us being able to share in that grief somehow because we were little and I think John held John held the grief a lot of that as being a twelve-year-old and understanding it the most The Retreat Utah yes Johnny Mathis remember much about moving Casper from Boston not really I just remember that the President Johnson at the sound plane for us to come back right Mom the highlight of their what I remember I can't remember when it was but there was a point which I knew that my dad died and Selma and that someone was murdered and then I had to go through that whole process and just right after we moved here I remember feeling like he was going to come in the door he was going to come it's going to come back he's going to come home one thing I regret to this day is that having children goes through this type of experience with the death of the father that I ate I didn't have some professional help baby and especially for John who whose life has been affected Sue many many years and that's one thing I regret you doing I should say not doing four generations of Reeves have gathered and Marie's living room that morning sitting on couches perching on armrest bouncing babies on Knees Atlanta before it's on the coffee table in the middle of the room or boxes and boxes of things about one box was full of newspaper clippings another stuff with letters from people across the country and there was a box that contains files related to the investigation and the trial trial I haven't read this when I call you did Mom sure there's a lot of no I don't think she would you not want to read I didn't want to read it just I didn't want to hear what they were saying you know and for years and years I never remember their names that was in the trial cuz I didn't want to see faces or names and I didn't want to have any kind of hate feelings developing for these men I I just didn't want that so I would have to look up the names somewhere to even call them to Memory this is the thing about the Reed family they don't dwell on who committed this murder on the Injustice of the acquittal but after all these years they did want some clarity about what happened to Jim and so sitting there in the living room we told them everything the definitive version of that night about Francis about Portwood the counter narrative that it's bring up to absolve these men and that from everything we've learned, cook was the one who swung the club that caused the injury that killed Jim and after we finished they didn't think about themselves so much about their own paint about a missed opportunity for justice and said they thought about what it meant in the lives of the men who would kill Jim so it was it was cook that had the really Club I can only surmise or imagine that those men had to take that and put that away almost to l&n put it over here put it somewhere so that they could go on with their lives because you tell yourself so many times I mean the story was put out there so that they cuz they're not telling the truth they know that that was wrong they know what they did was wrong they took someone's life they beat three men on street and yet they had to take that and put that over there and compartmentalize that and and start to even believe the only their own story that oh no they weren't there oh no that didn't happen that was somebody else Ono actually that man died by someone else's hand because the movement needed a murder so is all this compartmentalizing going in various to cope they were coping because they were guilty none of the men who killed Jim Reeves I'd ever been held to account none of them had ever had to wreck it openly what they've done but just a few months after this visit Andre Reed's living room in Casper something completely unexpected happened, Cooks great-granddaughter reached out to the Reeves to try and

from Jim's daughter Anne and his granddaughter Leah the two of them are coming to Birmingham to do an interview with a local filmmaker who is making a documentary about the unitarians role in Civil Rights Movement so we plan to get together while they were in town but a couple of days before they arrived and called me with some unexpected news the filmmaker had just given to talk about the film in a local University and afterwards a student at come up to introduce herself she said her name was Katie cook she was Elmer Cooks great-granddaughter and she told the filmmaker that if there was ever an opportunity she would really like to speak to the Reed family as part of their trip to Birmingham and and Leah have been invited to speak at the Unitarian Church and Aaliyah were sitting in the front row of the church and sitting at the very back was Katie cook they had plans to meet after the service this meeting between an and Leah and Katie nearly 54 years after Jim Reeves death it set in motion a series of events that would allow us to trace the legacy of this murder through the generations of the Cook family to see the different ways they had tried to reckon with it a little bit intimidating but I just have to remind myself that like I didn't do anything so I think that your rational people and that you have no reason to be mad at me cuz like when I told people that I was going to meet you there like is that a good idea and I was like well I don't think they're mad at me specifically so yeah I guess animal speak to a to I was shocked but I instantly was so you're a generation below me right so my dad is an older brother he's the oldest of James's kids what I thought about was just the evolution of change in generations and that you and I could have a choice has grandchildren and great-grandchildren to believe what we want to believe I didn't even know about all of this until I was a junior in high school has yeah I had always been told that my great-grandfather had been accused of murder because my mom and the family for the most part was like he was accused and they had this theory that she just beeped I don't know if I'm just going to say Reverend rehab rent refinance someone else killed him and I don't know if they truly believe that or cuz maybe they truly believe it cuz they just want to see the good or maybe it just helps them cope I don't know but when I found out about it I just did simple Google search Elmer cook Selma and I was like like there was so much stuff like I read like these articles about like LBJ getting involved and sending flowers to your mother and MLK speaking at the funeral and just like all of that and I was like wow show me depressing. Obviously I have some of his DNA part of what made him him is what makes me me but like you said it's on how you use it your family history doesn't make you unless you choose to and it's kind of ironic that the best way to separate myself from it is to jump straight into it and study it talk about it and everything I don't know I just like I think that a lot of people to be ashamed of it and I'm not because I didn't make those decisions and so oh yeah I want to know from you what it's like to have a father that's like such a like I can't like coming from the complete opposite of you I know what it's like to have family and negative history but I don't know what it's like to have a dad who is literally a martyr who did such a big huge thing out of his love and compassion for the people did a lot to live up to its hard sometimes it's hard because I was five and so I have just asked a few memories of him and so everything that I've learned about my dad I've learned from my mother from my older brother John and when I was a teen I started to also look into my history and really start to dig through boxes and I discovered some reel-to-reels of his sermons and so I was able to listen to his to his voice and it's so funny the first time I ever heard his voice I just I didn't hear one word he said all I did was just listen to his voice and it brought back the memories of his voice telling the stories reading to us at night so to answer your question there are times when it's hard for me it's it is a lot to to tell the story you know it is it's hard to tell the story because it can bring up some pain and but I think there's value in the story so yeah I think that there's a story but there's also some value in the pain from the story because I am a firm believer that pain spark sympathy empathy is the greatest human power to be able to feel for others and relate to them cuz I think the most important thing in the world because it's the only way that we can all share this world because without it there's just chaos Micro Center when Katie cook learn the story of her great-grandfather the first thing she did was call her Uncle Drew Drew it was older and as his grandson he was one step closer to Elmer himself is very close to his grandmother the family called big mama Elmer it was always called Big Daddy has gone through his own process of trying to make sense of his family's history and he's made a life for himself a very long way away from Selma we visited him in the apartment he shares with his partner in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens I don't know how other families are but our family is very very story-based I mean I don't remember specifically when they explained the situation to me but they did eventually in like the story that I was told as a child and maybe this was like really dumb down because I was a child but that big daddy and a couple of his friends were tried for the murder of a man who was I can probably story is that he was hit in the head or something I can't they going to fight and then he was Heavy head injuries and and so they say the ambulance took him to I think Birmingham like when he got into the ambulance they said he was talking and he was like coherent and then when he arrived in Birmingham is Skull is Christian and this is like the exact but Kisco expression I was like the point and then that was like all they told me really they never specifically said Big Daddy was innocent or anything like that. They just kind of left a meeting for my own conclusion about that obviously the implication is if he got any he was okay and he arrived and he had a skull Crush then someone in the ambulance did it or someone else did it and it's like a conspiracy of some kind against Victor temperature like I think now obviously absurd he knows a really absurd thing but it was told to you was it in the comment was this event in a context of the Civil Rights Movement at all or and summer everything is in the context of the Civil Rights Movement what happened after the head of the store to get deep enough for that like when did you find out more about it or do your own research into what happened so there was no it was me finding it out when I was in high school I don't know you know I feel a lot of Shame about that and I'm in Seamus something that gay people deal with from an early age I felt a lot of pain but I ignored it for a long time about what my grandfather was a murderous racist it's not a nice feeling I still feel like a very like nasty about that but but how did you do how did you come to think that he was a murderous racist cuz your family didn't say that well I mean it just you know this is my inference based on his behavior towards them I mean like I said if you could treat them that way I can sure I could treat other people far worse Drew was born after Elmer died but the whole Cook family still lived very much in his shadow Drew's father Bob will tell stories about Elmer's violence and it seemed to be no shortage of family squabbles and bad blood Drew's mother got him out of Selma at 13 moving him to the suburbs Birmingham any credits that move with basically saving him I spent a lot of time not thinking about Selma and not thinking about my past there because it was like painful and I didn't think about it so that that was very much and that category of things I don't want to think about but I remember the next time that it really like hitting me hard as when I was with my own two eyes of a New York City in East Harlem at this like tenement that included for like 5 years but my best friend Esther was living with me at the time and the movie Selma came out you know this would have blockbuster movies like 2014 I think and we are watching it and James Reeves murder is is dramatized in it and I remember thinking like oh my God oh my God this I know this is like this is this is James Rivas my grandfather inside like pause a movie I was like oh my God oh my God I was like I was really freaking out you know because you I guess I could feel the how close is historical events were to me and like how describes the real and crazy that is you know it's a very like strange feeling and subsequently I told I told all kinds of people that's like I mean I don't tell everybody because I know everyone assumed that everyone from Alabama are these like you know in your teeth racist but if someone seems like cool and we're having a long conversation and like we're talking about any kind of like adjacent issues like I'll tell circuit it's crazy you know it's like a wild wild story you know from Alabama and a lot of time lived outside and the burden that you feel as an Alabama n to swear to defend the place against against the claim against the claim that in your case is absolutely true which is that you're descended of these that's the other piece right it's like most shit I had him I talked about this cuz it's like cuz my grandfather is I mean he is this like a murderous villain you know he's just like racist villain that people are like thinkexist me really like the embodiment of it driven far away if we made his life but just like the rest of us he couldn't escape where you come from it's a one-day in the fall of 2015 thinking about the Reed family Drew cook sat down to try and write them a letter I don't know where it is your name the file letter to James Reeves son even know how to begin this letter how could I really after so many years and not even knowing the perpetrator is much less the victims but right now out of a deep desire to communicate my sadness and shame over what happened to your father I feel so deeply precisely because it was my grandfather Elmer cook who is one of the man who perpetrated the violence that took your father's life from what I've read no one really knows who dealt the Fatal blow but I would bet anything it was my grandfather who did it something inside tells me so I never knew my grandfather he died in 1972 I was born to his youngest son Bob and 1989 I never really knew him personally I would tell you that the memories of his violence and Madness Hunter family particularly my father to this day I see it and your reparable emotional scars inflicted on his children. I never I never completed it is a piece of writing it I mean I'm trying to put myself in your shoes a little bit but it seems like you get to a place where I can see why you wouldn't finish it because you're sort of like what is that ask your like on the one hand you'd like to maybe Express that your grandfather's Terror essentially terrorize your family too but then you probably also think but the man I'm writing to his father. You notice they must be like some push and pull their I would imagine probably and that's probably why I never finished that I was just like this is like exercise necessarily but I would like to at least communicate a condolence of some some some kind you know like to say that I'm and I'm sorry that happened cuz I am you know what's really it's really tragic what's the ideal outcome from that gesture in your mind like when you think about writing a letter or getting in touch like what what do you envision that comes snacks I would like to hear what he was like I mean he to me seems like a really extraordinary human being and I mean I've heard a little bit about his biography and everything and he just seems like I've really good man really decent man in the sort of person that I would like to be in life you know you know to me he was just a nameless man who died in an ambulance that questionably that was like before that I didn't really understand what you saw a figure than another version out like have you talked to your parents about that since then and it sounds like you've made that I mean my mom and I have open dialogue then my father died and I don't really talk about things that are we just stick to neutral topics your dad needs to think that his father didn't didn't commit murder I don't I think that one of the defining qualities of my dad is that he is like he does not have a lot of emotional tools to deal with things like he just has a very limited toolbox for that and so I don't think that he can he like has the emotional bandwidth to deal with some things and like that isn't very friendly one of the things that he just like we'll never reconciled never try to deal with that thing so we asked you if you thought his dad Bob would talk to us Drew said he didn't think so but he asked because he did want Bob to hear what we found and then a couple of months later we heard back from Drew his dad and decided to hear us out that's after this support for this podcast in the following message come from atlassian today nearly anything is possible and if we can dream it tames can build it from going to Mars to decoding the human genome atlassian is a collaboration software company powering teams Around the World products like jira software Confluence Trello and bitbucket help teens plan track build and work better together atlassian products are free to try easy to set up and work seamlessly together get started today at atlassian.

Louis were the hosts of through-line NPR's History Podcast forgotten stories from the moments that shaped our world from NPR listen And subscribe Bob cook is Elmer Cooks youngest child he lives in Tennessee near the Mississippi Alabama border but it didn't want us to meet him at his house instead we met him at the public library in the small town of Iuka Mississippi it was thunderstorming that day you were born some of that right so where did where did y'all live when you're grown up the Bourne lived on the corner of 2nd Avenue and Union what would you say your dad did at that time he had a loan business and where he loan money to people some might refer to it as long sharp Cassandra straight was really high and what about all the customers were black on right across from the Silver Moon had a place on the corner that was a pawn shop right next to it with C&C novelty kids Lancome their people come in and pay on their loan I remembered as young as 14 I would get up early and we go out about 4:30 or 4 and maybe when I was even 14 I would drive the truck and he could to these houses and he can go up there and have a be there a billy club with Blackjack and he always had a pistol he knocked on the door and tell them they need to come pay that was a regular thing but you would hear you know what the doors on some of them hollering and carrying on was your dad proud of himself as you proud of the work you did and good question I don't I don't think he felt guilty about everything so I don't know if he would be prouder I never saw him look like he was feeling guilty so yeah I think he was pretty successful when I was arrested for the murder of Jim Reeves the Selma Times-Journal printed his prior arrests Elmer have been arrested 25 times in Selma 17 of which were for assault and battery but this rap she didn't include the violence he brought home with him one night and he's asked me to go to Dairy Queen and get some chili dogs for so I drove my car out there and got him when I was there some guy was there and then he asked when I came home and saw you I said yeah he got in the car I didn't realize he live at Craig field which was a long way so when I got back we have glass across the back but then when I came back out lookin see my daddy eaten sandwich so I knew I was in trouble so I came in and started beating me and I'm not sure if it was that time or another but he grabbed me by the hair and hit me in the nose broke my nose Dennis and I had to feed the dog chili dogs to my dog outside are the thunder strike at the end of the story it must have yeah I know what you say about fear I must have just been terrifying how do you how do you process how to be around somebody like that when I was scared I can tell what kind of mood he's in but whenever he was mad you knew it and you tried to steer clear not do anything wrong but if there was any confrontation with him I think he may have been a boxer to in the Navy but if there was any confrontation than the first thing he's going to do is hit somebody dad talk to you about his involvement in the Rave attack I know you told me that he didn't ask a did beat those guys Hammond family name Doug whoever but he said he didn't kill it that was an important for you I don't know that I asked him maybe I did I don't remember he just told me that I don't know I just remember him saying that he didn't kill that he felt like somebody else killed on the way to Birmingham honestly I think he really believed it what makes me think that well but from what you hear about it I mean you would think so that the whole deal was the guy was got up with some helping went away and that's I think that's the real reason he thought the something else must happen that's the story Bob cook grew up hearing group believing and no one else in his life had ever offered a different version of events we found the name of this other man Bill Portwood do you remember I've heard nothing specific but I remember hearing something about that he may have been had something to do with it I don't remember asking but I remember him telling me something about it that his dad would ever be able to deal with the true story of what happened to Jim Reeve the Bob wanted to meet with us when he heard us out unless we talked it became clear you wanted to sincerely understand what we had found it we told you we we've been researching the story for a long time and then we first sat down yet some question that questions you have for us about what we've but we found out will a few thanks I did never understand I mean I never knew you by the house but why would they not go to the Bone or medical center rather than the Good Samaritan will they actually didn't go to Good Samaritan they went to Burwell infirmary basically did the white people who are sympathetic to the Civil Rights Movement were told by all the black folks a new in town that they couldn't go to those to those hospitals and not only that but there was not a neurologist you know in the entire city of Selma so regardless of who he was or what hospital he went to he would have been sent to Birmingham other questions about the nature of Reeves injury the doctor in Birmingham did he testify what did he say about the ambulance in the timeline of events by 8. He's a ver well being being the checked into Burwell by 8:30 is examined in the doctor pretty quickly says I discuss injury is a lot of people in Selma Bob had heard that it took hours and hours to get read from Selma to Birmingham when they stopped it was due to what we laid out for him everything we learn from the statements we've gathered files would come through the interviews we've done yo answer some questions I think that sounds very reasonable your answer makes sense to me the whole thing and how my took the time it really wasn't as much time as people had said that several different things that you clarified that I had the wrong understanding or from not be about we're not the only one it's a very pervasive story in this until the tennis day so it's one of the reasons why we wanted to try to figure out what really happened until information you share with me today then I thought that might be like some but now I'd say that probably not that it's probably the result of a baby you mean generator how to make you feel if that's something you just through come to today well again I know it's wrong and I never have been proud of the fact that I happened so I hate it for his family there is a seems to me and each one of us this temptation to be violent that's Jim Reed again from his last sermon at All Souls and so easily arise you know our own beings here where the issues are not of life-and-death matters how much more easily must arise and people who are suffering beyond anything that we can well imagine for ourselves we are going to have to really take upon ourselves a continuing and disciplined effort with no real hope put in our lifetime we're going to be able to take a vacation from the struggle for justice we look to the Past for all sorts of reasons to figure out how to separate ourselves from it to find models for how to live to better understand who we are because why we don't have to be defined by the people in our past they are buried in US my great-great-great-great-grandfather James Brantley moved from South Carolina to Alabama in the early 1800s he later married a woman named Elizabeth kirven and then James and Elizabeth settled south of Montgomery near Haynesville will it raise their five children when James died in 1843 Elizabeth buried him in their backyard and mark the grave with a simple stone she put a rocking chair beside the stone and it was our custom to sit there every afternoon and smoke a pipe what's James's will was probated all of this property was deeded to Elizabeth including the house the land and non-human beings will list their names and their dollar values beginning with quote one negro girl Rose $250 and ending with quote one negro boy Napoleon $100 a my great-great-great-grandfather Thomas Posey McConnell served as a judge in the county just north of where I live today he fought for the Confederacy at the dawn of the war in 1860 he was living up the road and he owned 16 enslaved people the oldest was a 63 year old man the youngest a one year old girl after he died in 1903 is Tombstone was engraved the memory of the just is blessed I don't know what it's going to take to make the world right I do know that you should not be sitting waiting for it to happen but somebody else to do it she was on the bridge on Bloody Sunday an eleven-year-old marching alongside her sister Joanne has been much of her adult life in Selma she co-founded the National Voting Rights Museum here and now it gets the right stores of Salma but the stores aren't just about what happened to your during the movement when you talk about reconciliation you have to talk about a way to distribute the power and nobody wants to give up any power anytime there's a minut shift and power from the people who are holding the power a battle ensues I can give you a perfect example the signing of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 tell me one year it has not been on the attack, I'm listening Sullivan and bone is not important why would you try to keep it away from me and why would you try to stop people from voting after they get the right to vote if it wasn't important Jo-Ann's trying to keep a certain pasta live in a place filled with lots of people who want to forget it and the people who want to forget it they tell Joanne she needs to look for needs to stop dwelling on this history that it's water under the bridge we need to move on unfortunately we got too many people feel that way so how can you tell me to move on service do you get bogged down in his sister and you stay there no no that's not true and I want you to realize those same thing to still happen in the day one of the things we've run into his white people doing this work on the store and trying to talk to White Solomon's who have some connection directly to the reef story is they have proximity to it but they won't have nothing to do with it I don't want to remember they may have forgotten it they will themselves to forget about to be reminded a painful things that you do that and I can't help but think some of them feel not just gifted but incompetent that song today if they were honest with themselves would say if they had known that this was going to be the result resulted in this man's death they would have gotten up and said something and now 53 years later you didn't get up and say nothing so now you got that burden on you song and my grandmother told us that all people are good some are sometimes even this will oversee that goodness I had a problem with that when I was growing up I didn't know any good white people . until the movement on the story which I get every so often with Joanne to see what was happening in Selma to give her updates on my reporting on our search for the Fourth Man on our attempts to make sense out of it all when we first started it felt like if we can find that person that would help something he would be a piece right plug into that puzzle you know if I put it all together and it's about the time it's 53 years later and most of their late 20s and 30s riding in and how old would they be now to all the talk about it yeah we've been very sounds convinced ourselves that a good outcome is just having a an official version something it's close to the truth as you can get knowledgement of some way that this happened the people lied about it at the time and he is in fact what happened these kind of story so often the way like this power structure that protected him for so long now I can turn the channel and do something else now I don't have to think about how implicated I am in something out of sight out of mind if it's not do nothing about it so now that we've received this up and sealed envelope and we can put that in file that and we don't ever have to talk about that anymore even though that the pain. there lies and and actions caused has determined how I am today and they don't realize that the how that connects thoroughly to to me you you've been exonerated cuz somebody said I'm sorry but I haven't the pain you inflicted still there this leads to this and this leads to that in this led to this and this led to that it's a continuous cycle is look like a tree with branches that if you cut off one breast don't mean it down tree on. It just how to grow another brand soda and that's what's happening we need to find the root of all this first off the mountains have to see this place out of the chalky white clay and after the bluff the people the first people to settle in this Bluff build the town and called it Selma as I laid the town out the designated for Kors watch for Church's 14 Public Square One for a market and in the middle of the busiest Street they built an auction house where white men to buy and sell black men and women and children the labor of these enslave people produce unnumbered bales of cotton which were loaded on the Steamers and sent down river and across the world and reaching this entire Yung Nation the North and the South what's a system that built that wealth was vicious and unconscionable soda justify white people hid behind a story they hid behind the last said white people were Superior to black people in this light wood into work long after slavery was abolished shaping so much about our country our neighborhoods in our schools are bank accounts in our prisons because our present is shaped by our past just as a bluff was shaped by the river it always comes back to the river when overcast afternoon in 1965 a group of men and women marched across the river on the Edmund Pettus bridge waiting them on the other side was an act of violence so shocking that it forced many Americans to see the brutality of the lie to say this is not the country I want to live in one of those people was a man named Jim Reed a couple of days later found himself with two friends standing in front of a restaurant just as the street lamps are coming on wondering whether to turn left or right cereal Ridgeback where can I find what lies is produced by us grahame-smith Nicole beemsterboer and Connor Town O'Neal with help from cat should neck a researcher is Barbara van woerkom Keith woods and Christopher Turf audio Engineers where Jace's James Willits and Alex Tradewinds Kiss music is composed by Jeff teper the music consultant for White Lies is Lisha special thanks again to the dexateens for the use of their song Take me to the speedway courtesy of estrus Records our story consultant was Julia Barton I'm outside help from Lisa pollock a big thank you to Chuck Holmes Darryl McCullough and staff of WB hm in Birmingham on NPR's investigations team as well as Neil Carruth and NPR standards and practices out of her Mark memmott + Michael Ratner Ashley messenger and Michelle Edwards from NPR's legal team thanks to Eric Westervelt and Thomas Berg for their help with our foia request we'd like to give a special shout-out to Jimmy Carmichael Bruce linear and Christopher Isaac make Birmingham Mark Nelson and Corey Armstrong in the College of communication and information Sciences at the University of Alabama Liz Ali Kyle leopard Drew Davis Tad Bartlett Chestnut and West McDonald and Scott suharto of Cornelius Chapel records episode comes from ABC News special thanks to Pam Powell Unitarian Universalist Church of Birmingham yeah you could public library in Iuka Mississippi Jim baggott the Birmingham Public Library Becky Nichols and the Selma public library and Beth Spivey at the old Depot Museum be sure to check out our website at NPR.
