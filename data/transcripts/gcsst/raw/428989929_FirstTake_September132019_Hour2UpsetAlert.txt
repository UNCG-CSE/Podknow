how about Lamar Jackson he faced so much criticism after a pitiful performance in the playoffs last season against the Chargers really quiet at the haters yesterday and Miami quarterback with a perfect passer rating franchise-record with 59.2 are you able to connect with you if you were going to throw the ball can you think you can prove to people that you were going to probably not but not bad for a running back he's definitely better you know he's better he's he's worked really hard and I think he's only going to continue to improve cuz you cuz he wants to work at itMax Omar did he prove he can be a better passer absolutely yes and I have something to say about this what I watch Lamar Jackson in college I thought he doesn't look to me like a pro quarterback and you have to realize when you say that about a quarterback an African-American quarterback The Stereotype Through The Years you think you may be enlightened right because you're not saying that about every quarterback right who's the black or whites for example DeShaun Watson look like he was going to be an excellent Pro quarterback to me although even he went a little lower and maybe then he should have been in Biscay went high or right but just because you believe you're enlightened on a subject doesn't mean you can't be influenced by kind of negative stereotyping that has gone on through the years why is Lamar Jackson dismissed to the extent that he's been dismissed so I talked a lot about Warren Sharpe and Sharpe analytics Stephen and he been running around all summer telling everyone Lamar Jackson is a much much better player Than People realize here's the thing about Lamar Live It Up passes on first down these highly successful that's what they did yesterday a lot right and look how successful understand so of Aldi and this is Warren trucks analytics of all the quarterbacks age or younger age 21 guys include the list includes Matthew Stafford Drew Bledsoe Alex Smith over all Sam darnold highest passer rating ever ever of all rookie quarterbacks with 150 + attempts including Andrew Luck and Jared Goff he had not only a higher passer rating but more yards per attempt in other words when you compare apples to apples with Lamar Jackson comparing them to every quarterback that ever played at the same age he's been better in important areas but all of them and yet there is an idea like he is real and he said not bad for a running back he also has a great personality by the way they put them in a position to win and he won solutely demonstrated that he has the chance to be a quarterback because of his age in many respects she's better than them if that continues we need to see a proof in which we did week one what's to stop him from being a great quarterback chop analytics is that what you said, so let's make sure there's no answer having said all of that let me say this will you play against matters and I'm not one that questions the potential of Lamar Jackson I watch them at Louisville I sure would be great thanks at the weekend I think that John Harbaugh is an exceptional coach I'm very fond of him and I love the way he developed players I am the growth that I saw from Lamar Jackson particular yesterday because those throws will absolutely On Target kid in God's the shortest kid Marquise Brown Hollywood Brown he is Hollywood he is something special his brother is especially even though I find it shocking to 2 to see that in one situation it was a safety on them in another situation was a linebacker. Y Flores because he was playing the Miami Dolphins who were atrocious they gave up a 49-yard run to England 60-yard Run to Levine the 83-yard bomb to Brown they gave up another 47-yarder to him you look at it going down it down I'm looking to hear they gave up a 39-yard to Andrews and 83 yard and a brown a 33-yard of the Sneed I mean you just look around the Miami Dolphins was so atrocious you just finished saying that the Dallas Cowboys had a bye week for the Dallas Cowboys have a bye week what the hell did the question that's right okay fair enough because that's really what this comes down to and so in light of that reality I got to pump the brakes just a little bit remember when we last Saw Lamar Jackson against the real NFL team with 30 minutes left with 30 minutes with 13 minutes left in the fourth quarter of a playoff game this man had three completions and 25 yards passing that's the last time we three fumbles that's the last time we saw or Lamar Jackson I get so real teeth so I believe in them but what I'm saying is you ain't going to get me elevate my praise about him based on a dolphin's measuring him against against Real players he's a baby when you measure him against the other babies he's the best one but somehow they are praising expectations are not and they're not called babies being prey in Baker Mayfield what happened to be in the Sean Watson there other 50 Arts 250 passes to Justin me a text so some of these guys are even older than it but I mentioned better numbers than Andrew Luck and Jared Goff and the list goes on when you compare an even two guys at similar stages in their career his accuracy from the big band what had a good day Mayfield and nose actually Andy Dalton and Lamar Jackson showed up yesterday which one you

doll he is the Tyco in the most nesting doll and lost in life Ellison let me see it free oh hello Grandma Infinity grandma abc rehab he's no longer with the black and silver by the bay instead he goes coast to coast and is now a member of the defending champs on that note we welcome his agent Drew Rosenhaus and Drew now I know why you're such a big shot I get paid the big bucks because this is my first interview benefits of 13 years and you're on the plane so we might get some announcements in the background but thank you so much for the time and good job by you thank you very much you know the wife of an agent was at the game last night I'm moving on to my next assignment looks like everything's going to be official soon here for a be so I'm on to my next job let me ask you this what we saw a Antonio just celebrating that video he's free why did he want to get out of Oakland so badly it was a tough relationship really from the get-go on fortunately we got off to a really rough start with the helmet deal and it really upset a b that's on the NFL told him that he couldn't wear a helmet that he wore in his whole career in the NFL person finds involved you know what I'm impacted his contract and is guarantees and to try and Salvage the relationship but unfortunately with the helmets in the fines it just didn't work out and although we tried to get it worked out it really was salvageable so I think that's why I was so excited that he was able to move on and then try and start over and make it work with another team and and that's exactly what's up we're going to do true with respect Max Kellerman go to see with respect that doesn't sound right to me because it was originally Belichick was ready was willing to trade a first they ask for a first and the second they wound up with a third and A V A V if they ask her if Patriot exercise the option for 20 million it's the same 30 million he would have gotten from the Raiders and his his tantrum seems so absurd that how would you answer the question for fans out there who still seem to think for good reason that the fix was in that he wanted to get to the Patriots that is absolutely not true we were really trying to make this work with the Raiders throughout the process really up until the day that he was released and we had no idea whether the Patriots would be interested in in fact I don't have any communication with the Patriots until well after he have been officially released after 4 so there was definitely not any scheme to get him to New England or any other team what happened was essentially because of the fine setting Antonio had the Raiders took the position that he could have potentially boarded his contract and that was not something Antonio was comfortable with moving for the relationship became fractured between Antonio and and the front or fortunately and essentially that is what led to the demise to get out of this when was prepared to play on Monday night and it wasn't until the fines in the letters and everything that this deal fell apart but thankfully everything is exciting now with the Patriots and he's up here and spending the day with the team and everything is looking very appreciate what you had to say let me break this down so the issue from the cryotherapy in France that had nothing to do with the Raiders the helmet issue he had a problem with when 89 Guys 1 in NFL right to the time that's 2800 NFL players he was the only one that was threatening to retire that was an issue that absolutely nothing to do with the Raiders he's on the record in the general manager according to reports he stood up Jon Gruden when they was supposed to meet he's crying about wanting to be free from the Oakland Raiders as if he was it seemed like he had something against the Raiders and it doesn't seem to make any sense whatsoever so when Matt asked you the question what about what are your thoughts about people feeling like the fix was in I'm looking at a guy like Drew Rosenhaus who is universally recognized that's one of the great agent in the National Football League who we all know knows the Patriots very very well why should anybody believe the fix was in it it's the truth what else can I say four letter that we received from the Raiders warning Antonio that is contract would be boarded he would be playing tonight for the Oakland Raiders that's the unfortunate that there's no question that there were some bumps in the road that fractured the relationship with the Raiders but even has recently it's Friday it look like he was going to be in a position to play Monday night with the team the apologize to the team we were trying to make it work the club wanted to protect themselves on the contract on the 30-minute guarantee Santa fortunately Antonio wasn't comfortable with daddy wanted out as a result and that led to New England they said you're universally recognized as a totally excellent agent because your clients get the things that they want but let's talk about this and why I'm skeptical of New England has magically has the cap space to make this exact deal work at the exercise the option is the same 30 million dollars and there's a report by Chris Mortensen yesterday a be sought advice from a professional social media consultant for ideas on how to accelerate is released from the Oakland Raiders is that report true to your knowledge of social media people decided to do that but quite frankly there was a lot of competition sign it stations with two teams going back and forth and there was a good chance that Antonia was going to sign with a team not named the New England Patriots have a long history of negotiating with the Patriots and it got some great players including most recently Rob Gronkowski but I still really Saturday afternoon around 5 despite the situation that he's in that the image of an Antonio Brown has taken the devastating hit particularly in light of the fact that he took a private conversation with you connected him with Jon Gruden on the phone and he put the damn conversation over YouTube now I bet he is in New England what did you tell him about what he needs to do moving forward since he's playing for Bill Belichick why didn't the light inside dealing with the Patriots for close to thirty years now and he's got a winning program and he is but he does her job and I explain Antonio that that's exactly what he has to do moving forward and he's comfortable with that he wants to catch passes from Brady got a be what he wanted regardless of how it was done will talk to you everybody's excited to add you know great players it helps everybody when you know you have great players that are sharing the enough of a tough football season so I think you know like anything else you know whether is Josh last year were on Philip when he got here a few years ago late and then you know this year Antonio you know how much can you learn and process and get in here and we're all going to work hard and try to get up to speed as fast as possible but we haven't had a training camp together or that so it's near you got a four slot information and now we're all excited to have and all I could say is we're just going to work as hard as we possibly can to take it up to speed as quickly as possible I'm not specifically Antonio Brown I'm worried about the guys in the locker room in the quality of our execution and what we did or didn't do Antonia has been off our team for a number of months that we we you know we moved on from that stuff in March and your thoughts on Antonio Brown join these guys now whatever 4 Patriot way back here with us we're going to break down the interview with Drew Rosenhaus let me just give you the fax again the same as for his release and received it from the Raiders the All-Pro receiver agree to a one-year deal with a fighting chance no sources tell our Chris Mortensen Max mention this that brown sought advice from a professional social media consultants for ideas on how to accelerate his release from the Oakland Raiders and Steelers Brown to the Raiders this offseason for a 3rd and 5th round draft pick but New England offered a first-round pick and Pittsburgh didn't want to send a b to arrival remember this other detail a b was going to get 30 million from the Oakland Raiders now he will get 30 million from the Patriots if they pick up that option Max will start with you on this one did a b plan on leaving the Raiders from the very beginning I have no inside knowledge of this but if you're asking my opinion and this is just my opinion of course he did this was an inside job it looks like from the outside just as Paul catches he write orchestrating things very well did it look like the Cleveland Cavaliers couple years ago or a clutch sports inside job of course it did I was critical of the lake or some weight this is a clutch sports inside job what do you not giving me the coach for you going to get the code for going to get a d you think about what happened you connect the dots the dots connect themselves what is Belichick want you wanted to trade for Antonio Brown according to reports was willing to get they first round draft pick for Antonio Brown soon as he gets to the Raiders why would he want to do the Raiders you can't win with who's going to win with the Raiders look at this conversation with Brutus which is illegal which is illegal the state of California people would have to know that going in before he even does that now that the Patriots magically have the exact cap space to give him about 10 million bucks up front what is the next 30 minutes going to get because I'm not saying this happened but I could imagine we want the option well I have to make sure he's not actually crazy says Belichick in my if I was doing faces on sticks I have to make sure so we're going to keep that option but you have my word if he's not crazy he's going to get the 20 same 30 million dollars to play on the Patriots 02 draft picks and by the way if I'm wrong I'm wrong but if you're asking me my opinion my God my opinion Bob with yours I agree I think that let me say this that's not my concern Drew Rosenhaus did a fabulous job working with us just now do I think that he was not being forthcoming about some things course I do and that's his job because if he were to be more revealing and more forthcoming about their interactions that went on or if I was he was he was my age and I'd fire him on the spot so he is supposed to say that stuff all right so Drew Rosenhaus did his job what I would like to ask people on a day like today I'm going to bring up rich Paul I'm going to bring up Bill Duffy in Aaron and Eric Goodwin in all of these boys and I'm going to say just the same way we Accord Drew Rosenhaus the level of praise and throw Lord of those in his direction for being who he is and his zealous efforts for representing his client let's make sure to record that same respect to Rich Paul and the others but let's also understand this and Damien you know where I'm going when I say this it's a hell of a big difference and oceanwide of difference between Antonio Brown LeBron James you see when you have a guy like LeBron James a superstar in this league champion in this league what we don't do enough is recognized the class that he has exercised without his Stella Korea LeBron James to this day the only blemish on his career in terms of his conduct was that the decision that's it Antonio Brown has lied he has played teammates and organizations he's acted like a clown he has embarrassed is organization himself he's thrown under the bus Mike Tomlin Our Revenue Orion Juju Smith Schuster when he text messages and stuff like that you were dealdos things publicly he did the same thing just now to Jon Gruden they had a conversation Drew Rosenhaus connected them what does this do do he go he published the conversation on YouTube this man has exhibited and display a level of selfishness the likes of which most of us haven't seen I don't even want to hear thiel's name again mentioned in this breath not like he should be ashamed of himself and I'm going to say this last one of them would give it to you I understand that as black men we have experiences that other people don't have and we didn't and we express our points of view or whatever but understand why because you got people want to come up that are going to be looking to emulate that and it will never get away with what he got away with and usually those of us that are in a privileged position understanding and we're sensible enough and unselfish enough to make sure that we don't sell me the pathway for others on the come-up regarded with a very good lies and I'm very curious so we can make sure that we don't do damage to those who will follow us Antonio Brown didn't care I don't give a damn about him being with the Patriots or whatever but I give a damn about is the nonsense that he engaged in to get to this point it's disgraceful I'm ashamed of his brother that's all I want to say I want you to follow follow me on a couple steps I'm about to take you through first of all I know we talked about the tiger quote on quote conspiracy with the you know how how everything transpired basing like 24 hours from being released to all the sudden magically being signed by the Patriots and the little bit back Antonio Brown gets traded by the Oakland Raiders and all the moves at the Oakland Raiders made this all season was because of his knowledge they want to become a better team but everything has a bigger reason the Oakland Raiders are moving to Las Vegas for State scared money doesn't make money okay and you try to try to feel some trying to feel seats and all those type of things so every coach comes in and thinks if I get a guy in my program maybe I can control him I can I can help make him into the player that will be willing to play for organization clearly that didn't work out why for the reasons that Steven A matched and everyone else is said about Antonio Brown he's a me first guy he's a very selfish guy he's not an honest guy so you know what Mike Mayock I don't want this we can't have this guy in our program I can't if we're trying to build is culture a culture similar to New England there's no way we can do that but this guy not program to Mike Myers okay we said by your side with the whole helmet situation we sat by your side with the whole situation you're not coming to practice you're not doing everything that the other 89 guys are doing I got to put the kibosh on that I won't find it and I won't take your money Antonio Brown it's just crazy I don't want this no other way around this supposed to sacrifice think about this what individual would celebrate lose 30 million. This is the second party equation Bill Belichick no one is going to Outfox Bill Belichick okay Bill Belichick is the type of person that he bought Penny on the dollar okay this whole 20 million option Antonio Brown would never see that I want to hear you will never see that 20 million had a one-year deal with another year with an option year he never saw that that's how the Patriots operate that's how coach Belichick I pray and this hold 10 million that you supposed to say this year that's what it is it's a signing bonus you know what you can do with a signing bonus as opposed to like your regular so you can steal you can stretch it any way you want to be when you don't have to prove to me that you want to follow the Patriots way because the meaning that you don't you will never see any more money than the following week that's how the picture they play checkers not chess tell me how to transfer pictures on the on the other side of anything they're still the Patriots be good without Antonio Brown so it's really up to Antonio Brown if you're going to fall if you don't fall in line and be a part of what's going on right here if you don't have much of the same analysis but let me just present you another alternative that fits the facts you just said what if Drew Rosenhaus sits down with Antonio Brown and says they're not going to trade a first in a second for you way back when Mike Tomlin correctly set as you pointed out to volunteers not hostages he was well-paid hostage still in Oakland right he got out of there wasn't a volunteer what if he said you're not going to give him a first and second for you I had a conversation with Belichick and said okay you know what could be a conversation like this if it doesn't work out in Oakland would you be interested yeah but on a one-year deal and then you didn't say okay give me to get 10 guarantee or night whatever the numbers going to be guaranteed up front and then you can get the same money but you're going to have to be a good soldier you're going to have to or you willing to do that then we have to get you out of Oakland if a b signs up for that think of the fact first there was helmet gate as they say nowadays right then you blast the team on social media throws everyone under the bus including his teammates about the fines then don't show up to something in the first place even to get to find the contract and he tries to fight the GM and uses a slur against the GM illegally record the conversation with social media yeah I want to be on the Patriot yeah I can be a good drink at the Whole 30 million was this you talkin about a me first guy who had 30 million in the bag and now you're asking of me first guy who's been that way his whole career that you basically fall in line to try to get 30 billion to try to work and get 30 minutes maybe 20 million you you went away from it at that last part because it's not really about that here's what it's about God's he left Pittsburgh because he wanted guarantee dollars over the course of more than one care he got that from Oakland then betrayed them that's the issue you had your money you betrayed them now you went to a better situation in New England because they're trying to win but ultimately everybody would we talkin about here with talking about capitulation how you going to have to capitulate to Bill Belichick you can't sit up there and come to practice late you can't skip practices you can't keep the team plane waiting what's the problem with all of that it reminds us of what he got away with in Pittsburgh if you got away with it in Pittsburgh who does that make us think about Mike Tomlin and as a result because of your own selfishness Schnitz okay with the fact that you seem to have no problem betraying people you through my Tom and under the bus you put him in the eye of the storm because never Mike Tomlin has been accused YouTube Big Ben Roethlisberger under the bus when he's your quarterback and he's got he's got the yellow y'all it was this bad but you also bring race into the equation and Ben Roethlisberger was at the different what I was told to actually talk to those other teammates because he thought they would side with a TV so he never told them all the baby was engaging it away from them Juju Smith Schuster the other receiver BP on it to do this brother Young Brother 21 years old. Nothing but love and praise for you you throw him under the bus you reveal private text messages OK Google ball with this franchise works but we know what he's made up you called him a sell-out to do go to Oakland that you got nothing to do with the cryotherapy they don't have anything to do with the helmet the grievances against the National Football League you on the phone with another brother in Troy Vincent a dude and you go for now and then after that you sit up then you threaten the gym the coach is supposed to be with you I don't shut up and Chris Mortensen has reported the coach off after he gave you the 30 million apologize to the team and in a matter of hours after the apology you don't go and check the private conversation violate California state law mandates supposed to both parties are supposed to agree to a conversation that you put the conversation on YouTube me when you turn this brother had violated man cold decency professionalism and we got Brothers out here literally saying where to go in Tonio no this is the kind of stuff we got to put a stop nobody out there but I have a question for you is your principal objection I know it works on both levels is the principal of jection that in a team sport or just for common decency that level of narcissism and selfishness doesn't work nothing flying shoe is it more that as a black man because you have mentioned it before you think there's a greater degree of responsibility to other African-Americans in particular is that your principal objection but certainly more the ladder you're absolutely right that tries to emulate his behavior I promise you 99% of those folks who suffer dire consequences to think for one second and I'm not saying that other people can get away with it please don't get me wrong I'm not trying to imply that a profession you don't pay a price that will cost you everything do not and you're like this it sounds to me like you're marrying two different ideas there on the one hand it is it is principal the wrong thing to do. Considering the plight of African-American stereotypes etcetera but you're marrying that idea on principle would be ideal for the vast majority of people that won't work anyway which is more important to you the principle that it's the wrong thing to do with the fact that you believe it will have negative consequences I believe the principal is more important than just the consequences because that's what I'm the one that's what I'm made of but I also think it's important because here's the deal that I believe is problematic not Society I believe too many people talk about principal and is not enough conversation about consequences I know why do it don't do this don't do this don't do that when you remind them of the price to be paid if they don't listen to delete it is tingling a little bit more if folks hear you we need to talk about consequences more with this whole situation is crazy you go from having 30 million in the now to basically where New England has all the leverage with it the way they struck the signing bonus you have to literally earn it every week what's in their structure that Patriots way structure listen I've been in meetings in New England where Bill Belichick is ripping you in front of everybody you think Antonio Brown has ever been used to someone just undressing him in front of the whole team and he's got to do that every week for the next 15 16 weeks you think you can handle that equal last season I mean undressed you don't think what I'm saying is when you have the culture Setter like Tim Duncan and San Antonio or Tom Brady would probably for Tom Brady with Belichick and everyone sees that neck guy can be undressed then everyone can be and I just asked me to tell you what the good news about this is rhetorical question before I answer this do y'all believe somebody like this should be in complete control of their own destiny at the expense of anything and everyone else has Antonio Brown no longer has the freedom he wants at hand he got through tonight and play to play tonight for the Oakland Raiders as of tomorrow morning the whole 29.12 how to make a left on his deal would have been guaranteed now yeah the money looks like it's there but it's after in the disposal at the discretion of the New England Patriots what's a Super Bowl Worth to Antonio Brown has done everything else so the money that made him much harder to trade he got to where he wanted to go you got a good chunk of the money and he's going to win the Super Bowl now all right going for the Cowboys and Eagles in the NFC East. For 4 touchdowns Dover 400 yards in the Cowboys win over the Giants Billy got off to a slow start but came from behind 17 points down to hold off the Redskins Steven A which team has the more impressive opener Dallas or Philly you know your struggles and what have you in the Beatdown in the 1700 hole and it come back the way that they did with that bomb that DeSean Jackson and then another bomb to the Shawn Jackson and the spread the ball of all over the field way to cost Wednesday for Carson Wentz himself to do it as well I thought was incredibly car in encouraging and so will you have Carson Wentz out there reminding you that he is an MVP candidate when healthy and then you add the Deep threat that is DeSean Jackson pretty much coming home because by the way he should have never had to leave Philadelphia that was a Chip Kelly Fiasco and Bar wait how you doing in and UCLA Chip Kelly have to have everything going okay with you and Nelson agholor and Zach ertz and what-have-you you know we can sit up there and talk about Dallas Cowboys all we want to and they are formidable please make no mistake about that but the Eagles are no joke and and when you saw them come back the way that they did we have to admire the fact when we look at Kansas City last year that we were raving about of course Patrick Mahomes is that God but we also noticed that in the blink of an eye they could explode we looked at Miami when they had LeBron and D-Wade in a blink of an eye on it could explode when we looked at the Golden State Warriors with step play and they've been Kevin Durand the crew and Damian Lillard talk about what happened to use like man you know we'd be out they were up 17 18 points at all for game Eagles showed me they are capable of I like that because I think that's what it's going to take to take the NFC I respect that point of view because the Giants are nothing the Giants have saquon Barkley in and that's it in cat Patch casket you already has patch passing tight end and Shepherds a good route runner in all that stuff but come on all NFL teams have guys like that the Giants are outside of Miami they look like that the worst roster in football so I get it however it's not like Washington is loaded and they were up 17th the Eagles were playing at home and Washington was up 17 the Eagles had to come back out of now I get what you mean it's impressive cuz you saw that ability to come back in and it was Dallas Cowboys can't control who's on the schedule what they can do is control the way they play all facets of the game they looked spectacular was perfect quarterback rating they didn't even have to try the quarterback if you're just asking what the answer was the Dallas Cowboys may I do to my own horn but Dallas Cowboys definitely looked but look better between the two actually pick Philadelphia but when I look at the Dallas Cowboys first while you got a first-year play call when Kellen Moore no one had any expectation of what this office was going to look like I'm considering he was he was a former player just a couple years ago now he's calling play for the Dallas Cowboys Jason Garrett relinquish his business and put into office and let Kellen Moore do it without the running game that the Dallas Cowboys have been accustomed to having and controlling the clock formula Dak Prescott look unbelievable he was spread the ball of brown I mean play action pass concepts of juicing for the Dallas Cowboys office life where is that been why haven't you guys been running that for some time now so you got to give a lot of credit to you know the new play Colin Kelly and Dak Prescott has like every game that you don't pay me it becomes a more expensive for the Dallas Cowboys I don't know I know that there's this idea better pay him now or else if you just sent me set the market was Ezekiel Elliott and your battery reset it with back in fact my point of view with this point is you're buying back the top of the market now you're never going to have to pay more than even if he goes tonight on at are like this the whole season to make any more money if he's already going to reset the market as is this year China bigger deal than women think they're going to give me a bigger deal anyway is my point and if they already plan on resetting the market with him what difference does it make when you get that mean it's going to get it done soon but at this point I might wait because I think the longer you wait the more you going to end up having to pay back I think the sooner you paid back the better off you'll be that's just my personal opinion I just think that that's what they should do and I don't know that you sort of get to a point where it's like all right you signed Leo Collins you signed Jaylon Smith you signed Ezekiel Elliott but your quarterback is the one left waiting you know come on now at some point in time you got to step up you got to take care of this young man having set all of that we saw Dak Prescott throw for 400 yards yesterday and we're seeing a man expect to see him playing in the football more because that's what the new offensive coordinator Kellen Moore wants to do that supposed to be what differentiates him from this except from his predecessor and Scott Linehan but in the end is Ezekiel Elliott as he gay it's his wheels under him this brother's going to Care to boil a hell of a lot more than 13 times in the case of the Philadelphia Eagles what you saw is exactly what we expect Carson Wentz is going to have to fling that football in order to get it done in the only question is can you keep him upright so if you can come out right and healthy we expect the Eagles to have something to say about the summer and Nick Foles September 20th July broadcast DJ come watch me Crush Master course that's loud as well not listen to your voice even a September 20th Showtime Mahomes is the truth picked up right where we left off in his MVP season throwing three touchdowns has nearly 400 yards in a win Jacksonville it didn't come without a Costco tire retail of a broken left collarbone he will miss a few weeks according to Adam schefter gentleman here's the question is Mahomes the best player in the NFL Max what does MVP mean and he's going to do it without Tyreek Hill let me explain something he threw in his first year starting to the I like a combination of Aaron Rodgers and Brett Favre turnovers VP that normally debates with 378 yards 3 touchdowns 143 passer rating and 11 and 1/2 yards per attempt what am I supposed to see is can you defend the MVP Crown rights be in the mix 2 3 he is the Mike Trout of football a generationally historically significant Talent I think there's a difference between the best player and the most important player there's a distinction there okay I don't want to ask you this question who plays who plays their position better Patrick Mahomes or Aaron Donald Aaron Donald Henry Gaskins please his position right now better than my two most important position to me it's not we can always go to the court because the quarterback is the most important position in football position in the National Football League Aaron Donald highlights the difference between Aaron Donald and the next best guy twice is Patrick Mahomes Aaron Donald tomato tomahto you right I watch Tom Brady last night my God this dude I made that again it might be because the Steelers still have a damn defense again haven't had the top defense in the world top 10 defense in a while but the surgeon that he is on the football field need to be 42 and there's no loss in velocity and I could tell just pick people for it's not just about throwing a football it's about reading defenses it's about I saw him demoralize God and man Hugh Douglas 72andsunny years ago he's at the defense of line and he was depressed because he was going against Dan Marino and Dan Marino walked up and told the team for the hell were about to do set up smart about a championship game last year and there's a lot of wide-open receivers for kids see that defense of Jacksonville was not that impressive, but Andy Reid using the Belichick lines bring me my God people are Peyton Manning's once was only he doesn't fall off in the playoffs signing it's canceled because the Patriots got a B we ask people in Twitter 54% said yes party's over. and the only thing is if somebody out there to rush with just your fool and get to the quarterback that would happen to me maybe Chicago is the problem is the football player in me says No I just I can never say that because On Any Given Sunday anything can happen I was on the team we got the most 45 to 3:45 to 3 in the regular season and we came back in playoffs and beat that same team well that are perfect the Patriots are overwhelming favourites the Eagles and some other teams matchup kind of well with them I think they are the overwhelming favorite it's depressing act it is depressing Steven Facebook listen to the podcast First Take weekday 10 a.m. eastern on ESPN have a great day will see y'all tomorrow
