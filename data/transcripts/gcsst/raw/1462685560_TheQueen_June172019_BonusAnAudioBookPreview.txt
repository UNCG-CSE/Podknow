chapter 1 a new victim
 juncture when tossed his day's work on the front seat of his unmarked Chevy he fished five or six burglary reports from his pigeonhole after roll call enough to keep him in his partner occupied all morning and for a good chunk of the afternoon
 Sherwin didn't need any more assignments he had at least a half-dozen more reports jammed inside his briefcase
 the Chicago burglary detective turned on the police scanner and peeled off his sport coat
 August 12th 1974 was sunny hot and unbearably humid the sky felt heavy but it wouldn't rain all day
 Sherwin headed east from his unit's headquarters on 91st Street and South Cottage Grove past the Jewel Food Store where a group of armed men had recently made off with $1,000 hold
 he parked his car in South Chicago a working-class mostly black and Latino neighborhood bordered on the west by the Skyway a toll road that carried Suburban commuters above a part of town they'd rather not drive through
 a month earlier a 66 year old woman have been shot in the neck a short distance away in Calumet Heights on the street outside st. Albie's Catholic Church she died in our pastors arms a couple of teenagers both alleged members of the Blackstone Rangers gang were charged with killing that was one of 970 murders in the city in 1974 more than four decades later still the most homicides in a calendar year in the history of Chicago
 Sherwin wasn't dealing with anything as messy as a murder case this was a routine burglary not a big enough deal to justify his partner Jerry Kush getting out of the car
 the two-story 6 unit brick building at 8221 South Clyde Avenue look like a tiny castle with a crenellated roof and Arch over the entryway and Limestone ornaments near the windows Sherwin rang the bell and got bust inside as he knocked on the door of a first-floor apartment he looked down at his clipboard and rehearse to sequence of well-worn questions what's missing did anyone see what happened is there anything you'd like to add to your original report
 when someone called about a smashed front window or a stolen jewelry box uniformed officers went to the scene and wrote it up getting a statement from the victim and enumerating the basic facts the time the location would have been stolen the burglary investigators followed up often from a seated position if you treat a detective work like a desk job occasionally exerting Yourself by picking up the telephone you could push a new report off your desk in less than an hour nobody ever solved the case by making a single phone call but it hardly mattered given how rarely burglary detectives were covered people's losses there were nearly 200,000 burglaries robberies and thefts in Chicago in 1974 an increase of 18% over the previous year
 sherwin's territory with the Department called area to on Chicago's Southeast side with the busiest in the city with 39 burglaries a day
 a big picture thinker wouldn't have lasted a week and area to those stats told a depressing Story one filled with a kind of hopeless characters who subsisted on the proceeds from Petty crimes but sure we knew it wasn't on him to fix Chicago he handled what he could see and what he could touch you prefer to check out crime scenes himself to imagine who'd been there and what they done he broke down each new assignment into a series of predictable tasks doing all the things a conscientious burglary detective was supposed to do he talk to the right people chase the right leads and wrote everything up and clear concise reports
 the door opened at 8221 South Clyde and Sherwin took stock the woman standing in front of him four days earlier Linda Taylor had called area to headquarters to say that her home had been burglarized Taylor appeared to be in her late thirties she was just over 5 ft tall with olive skin and dark have a lit up eyes or face a long oval tapering to a sharply jutting chin seemed vaguely Elfin or eyebrows plucked Into Thin arcs made her look like an old fashioned Glamour Girl
 she had a pronounced Cupid's bow in her upper lip and when she talked that lip curled back to reveal the glint of gold dental work Taylor looked as though she was expecting company her makeup was Christine her outfit fashionable and snug
 as he stepped into the apartment sure would notice that Taylor kept a tiny house sometimes if you went out on a Case right away he could see where a burglar had barged in but there were no signs of forced entry hear the bolt on Taylor's front door appeared on damaged nothing was broken or scattered around Sherwin glanced again at the uniformed officers original report could they go through that list of missing items one more time
 a large green refrigerator complete with ice maker yes she told him that was gone
 a gold stove yes stolen
 it was a weird list Hospital end tables a grandfather clock to large Chinese lamps large elephant figurines a pair of speakers that light up to the beat of music
 thousands of dollars worth of household Furnishings every piece of it insured most burglars snatched whatever they could fit in their hands a ring a necklace a stereo a small TV set stealing a refrigerator and Hospital end tables bulky objects you couldn't hustle out of an apartment without attracting attention didn't make much sense
 Sherwood went back to his clipboard and study the report he asked Taylor to explain again how the thieves had gotten away with her belongings she put it to a window in her kitchen and opening no more than a couple of feet across Taylor's version of events was Preposterous to fit a double door refrigerator through that narrow Gap you have to cut it in half the detective didn't press her for more details he thanked Taylor for her cooperation and he promised to come around again just as soon as he developed any leads
 on his way out Sherwin drank some more doorbells but he couldn't find any neighbors had seen a mysterious stranger wander off with a large Appliance as he walked back to the car he thought about the clean apartment the tiny window and the woman with the olive skin in the heavy-lidded eyes there was something so familiar about Linda Taylor he was sure he'd had this exact case with this exact woman he just couldn't remember where or when
 Sherwin nuland to Taylor Street he grown up just a few miles away in an all-white neighborhood close to what was then the southern tip of the city's black belt back then in the 1940s segregation had been enforced with covenants that forbade the sale of properties to for instance every person having 1/8 part or more of negro blood black belts borders expanded in 1948 when the Supreme Court struck down those covenants but segregation didn't end with a stroke of a pen new public housing developments kept black people can find to Black on Klipsch as did violence perpetrated by whites against those brave enough to breach long-standing barriers
 when civil rights activists and queen of gospel Mahalia Jackson move to the South Side in 1956 or white neighbors shot BB pellets Through the Windows of her house other black newcomers had their homes ransacked and set on fire
 the sherwin's like many white families packed up and moved when Chicago's racial boundaries shifted settling in the area around Midway Airport 30 years later the detective scoped out South Side neighborhoods that bore little resemblance to the one he lived in as a child some of the areas in his jurisdiction had changed from middle-class white enclaves to middle-class black ones the city's most beloved athlete Cubs Legend Ernie Banks live with his family on a tree-lined street in Chatham on his daily rounds Sherwin passed by black owned Banks the headquarters of the Johnson Products Company manufacturer of the hair straightener Ultra Sheen and the office of our Eugene pincham a renowned black defense attorney and advocate for the disenfranchised
 Sherwin also rolled through hollowed-out Street started with liquor stores and check cashing operations South Chicago the part of town where Linda Taylor lived had long been the city smoke belching industrial Corridor home to us steals Mammoth South works and countless other plants factories and forges but between 1967 and 1977 the number of people working in manufacturing in Chicago proper would plummet by 33% white flight took both jobs and services to the suburbs cutting off thousands of black Chicagoans from steady employment and weakening the foundations of once stable communities
 area to burglary detectives didn't spend their days chasing after Master criminals they arrested juveniles and attics young men who were more desperate than cunning Sherwin drove to Grand Crossing in South Shore and Pullman stopping off at apartment buildings and restaurants to jot down notes about busted back doors and stolen cash
 he spent most days to ft to the left or right of Jerry Kush with one man driving in the morning and the other in the afternoon Kush was the best partner Sherwin had ever had honest and reliable but they were close friends well Kush wore flashy clothes Sherwin looked and dressed like a standard issue detective with short hair and a daily uniform of a sport coat and Thai Kush never stopped talking about his kids his marital woes and anything else that came to mind Sherwin didn't want to probe too far below the surface
 sometimes they hit the bars after work but Sherwin didn't like to drink he hated the sensation of losing control
 Sherwin felt most comfortable when he was by himself and high school he didn't go to parties or dances it was too self-conscious to look at girls much less talk to them he found his confidence in the Marine Corps when he came home after basic training Sherwin wore his dress blues everywhere and he sat the way of marine was supposed to sit his spine not touching the back of his chair
 in 1962 after a stint as a tank commander on Okinawa he joined up with the Chicago Police Department As A Beat cop assigned to neighborhoods on the west and south east sides he could go from helping a woman deliver a baby to disarming a man threatening his girlfriend with a butcher knife Sherwin loved the unpredictability of police work and he took pride in protecting Chicago and its citizens
 there were times though when he thought those citizens actions were indefensible Sherwood watch the Westside ignite following Martin Luther King Junior's assassination in April 1968 and he was on duty a few months later during the clashes between protesters and cops at the Democratic Convention a study commissioned by mayor Richard J Daley found that the MLK riots stemmed from pent-up aggression among black Chicagoans infuriated by poor schools and adequate housing and racially discriminatory policing while the federal report on the Democratic Convention documented unrestrained and indiscriminate police violence in response to demonstrators provocations
 Sherwin didn't come to the same conclusions he feared for his life during the West Side riots and he'd seen protesters attack policeman at the convention
 he was certain that he and his fellow officers were the good guys no matter what was happening in Chicago nobody had the right to tear up the city
 Walter Sherwood made detective his life got a lot more sedate and Kush still answered the occasional in progress call and they still tussled with burglars now and then one time they went to make an arrest and found their suspect hiding in a closet the man charged out completely naked and Kush hit him on the head with a portable radio Sherwin and could talk about that one for years but naked guys didn't jump out of closets on the average Monday afternoon
 Sherwood believed in the work he was doing but he wasn't always stimulated by it the job could be relentless and dispiriting most days the detectives added a bunch of new reports to a caseload that was already overwhelming
 after work the 35 year old police officer would go back to his two-bedroom apartment and do laundry some days he'd head out to a religion class he was studying to be a Catholic so he could share a face with his fiance
 wake up early before 3 a.m. to go for a run at Northwestern University before work with the sky pitch black and nobody else around he had time to indulge the half-formed ideas bouncing around his head the morning after his visit to the Tidy apartment on South Clyde Avenue sherwin's mind kept wandering back to Linda Taylor he going to her home on August 12th expecting to investigate a burglary he left a half hour later thinking he needed to investigate the burglary victim
 Lamar Jones couldn't remember the last time something interesting that happened to him at work the dental clinic at Great Lakes Naval Training Center was an assembly line of fifty chair operation that treated a hundred thousand recruits and 700000 Cavities each year the 21 year old knew what each day would bring any new what would happen the day after and the following week but August 12th was different that afternoon a few hours after she'd met Jack Sherwin at 8221 South Clyde Avenue Linda Taylor drove up to the naval base in North Chicago to get her teeth cleaned
 from the moment Jones saw her Swagger into the room he wanted to get close to her she was self-assured and beautiful and older woman with the smoothest skin he'd ever seen the other Sailors noticed or two they each took a shot sauntering over all cool and casual but she turned up her nose at each hey baby she treated Jones differently she joked with him and flirted he left work that day feeling better than he felt in his entire life of all the guys in the clinic she was the one she'd chosen
 her name she told him was Linda show via
 Jones a grown-up on the southside of Chicago his mom it struggled to raise six kids on her own and he fought his own battles in the neighborhood as gangs like the Blackstone Rangers and the Cobra Stones Rose to power in the 1960s disabled High School the alma mater of Nat King Cole and Harold Washington Chicago's first black mayor became a prime recruiting ground and occasionally the setting for violent confrontations but Jones had made it out joining the Navy and setting himself up for a better life
 but he started dating Linda show via that life looked better than he could have possibly imagined
 although Jones never saw her doing any work his girlfriend seemed to have an endless supply of cash she didn't try to hide or wealth draping herself in Furs and driving a fleet of luxury Vehicles Jones consider himself street-smart it had to be growing up where he did but this woman and her money made him drop his guard on Saturday August 17th less than a week after they met at the Great Lakes Clinic the couple got married at Chicago City Hall
 the new mrs. Jones spoiled her husband giving him a couple of new cars and $1,000 right after they got hitched she was generous Cosmopolitan and well-educated a 35 year old Haitian woman with a degree from a Caribbean University
 she was poised to sometimes even arrogant commanding respect every time she walked into a car dealership or Bank
 the honeymoon phase of their marriage didn't last as long as their brief courtship after Jones got transferred from the dental clinic to Great Lakes security unit and assignment that required him to gear up like a police officer and a colleague decided to play a practical joke they knocked on the door at 8221 South Clyde hiding in the shadows so Linda wouldn't know who was there as soon as she opened the door Jones's friend shove the badge in her face she flew into a rage slamming the door and screaming that she hated cops
 if Jones knew what was good for him she shouted he never pull anything like that again
 Linda said a lot of crazy things just after their wedding she told Jones he was her Ace husband and that she killed the first one shooting him in the chest she said another of her husband's had worked for Greyhound and been crushed to death in a bus accident maybe she was telling the truth or maybe she was just trying to scare him
 either way he wasn't sure what she was capable of
 everywhere Jones looked something was a little bit off
 that degree from a Haitian University have been awarded to Linda Taylor not Linda show via his wife had four different names on her mailbox at 8221 South Clyde and she get letters addressed to all of them she had a sister named Constance who seemed more like her adult daughter
 Jones also suspected that Linda's two small children weren't really hers
 he wasn't even sure she was from Haiti or that she was 35 years old on their marriage license she given her age is 27 Jones thought she was black but he wasn't absolutely sure her light complexion allowed her to pass as white one day and Asian the next when she took off her clothes and slipped in the bed he noticed a long scar near her navel what he thought was an incision from a hysterectomy one night he woke up Before Dawn and saw that his Brides skin wasn't so smooth she had a thousand wrinkles on her face
 after he caught a glimpse of her without makeup she locked herself in the bathroom for an hour
 when she came out she look like a whole new person
 on the morning of August 13th the day after he first stopped by Linda Taylors apartment Sherwin grab 6 new burglary reports from his pigeonhole but before he and Kush started on all the new stuff Sherwin took a detour to 8221 South Clyde Avenue for the second day in a row he rang the bell outside got buzzed into the front hallway and knock on the door of a first-floor apartment when the door swung open Sherwin saw an older woman staring back at him it took him a moment to realize that this too was Linda Taylor the face untouched my makeup at our body draped in a housecoat
 once more Taylor told him what have been taken from her she said again that an enterprising burglar had stuffed her jumbo size refrigerator through a narrow kitchen window she spoke with a confidence that verged on arrogance as if she couldn't bear to waste your time explaining something so obvious
 most burglary victims Sherwin for showing an interest in their cases but Linda Taylor didn't seem grateful to see a police officer making these trips to South Chicago
 she didn't defer to sherwin's expertise and she didn't bow to his authority and asked for his help and she didn't need it
 Sherwin had been a Chicago police officer for 12 years a detective for three he been the lead investigator on hundreds of burglary cases this didn't look like a burglary and it didn't feel like one either
 there was only one reason to think the place have been knocked over Linda Taylor insisted that they were standing in the middle of a crime scene
 Taylor hadn't told Sherwin anything new but going back to her apartment hadn't been a waste of time seeing her face again had jog the detectives memory
 that afternoon Sherwin place to call to the Michigan State Police he told the sergeant who answered the phone that he might know the whereabouts of Connie Jarvis
