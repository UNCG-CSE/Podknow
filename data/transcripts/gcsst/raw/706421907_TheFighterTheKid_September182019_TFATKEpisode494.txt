So much weight I got to carry your watch your p's and q's yes so to me and I would never the reason I wouldn't use that word that never use that word okay chink or whatever and why the f word them whatever it is I don't want to make people feel bad and I'm very aware it's derogatory I'm very aware was used in a very derogatory I also guess what because I don't hurt people's feelings that is shity and I don't want to be that guy is it possible that this guy is not racist. Said was saying he was using it it how people say that particular house is well a little pretty did tell me if you keep going back there's worse than this so that I could do it wasn't this if it's something sensitive but not race is also really good, yeah but that was the problem with that where you don't see like very many good communes defending him cuz it's a it's not funny educate the dude gets get him to see hey hey do hey hey this this sucks this sucks for the here's the history of Gears the history behind this word this is what it was like to be chinese-american what it was like to be Korean to put the fucking history is country where it's parked where you are third class citizen I said okay but but when you fire somebody when you say you're out to me that's cancel culture it to me you're not make the world a better makes it worse right but also how about this so we're in the parking lot of The Comedy Store last night all the comics or we're all talking and we'll talk about the situation we're with Tim Dillon who is a gay man well-documented so we're all talk in a group Santino Tim some other guys d'elia's there Brian Brian comes up and it's Tesla I was making fun of Brian is that I'm a few notices Brian Cummins Tesla I make a remark about how gay is driving the Tesla front of Tim and the other guy has his boyfriend I don't know why yell out a derogatory term of driving a Tesla now it's a bit in a way that was way harsh for me Yea Yea making fun of you Brian but I don't have it I don't have listening test is great I think the technology behind it's fantastic that's the future is natural Corral in my Aston Martin was there a park in front of it so he's a bit we always do in Italy is in on it Tim's there was a gay man I said it and as is coming out with you more on whatever everyone laughed and laughed and laughed but all I could think about the whole night till night I get home right around midnight or whatever I text him Leo dude I know where, so I don't see a lot of shit I pray I don't need to tell you this but just to make me feel better cuz I'm a narcissist just make me feel better when Brian pull up in his Tesla I called him gay I feel terrible about it and I wait wait wait until I get back to bed and listen you definitely apologize for that I get where you're coming from your not home but like you know he's cool about it too dude and he hangs out with nothing but straighten this out I love him unless he told you you would know you been included it always comes down to me and always have no do the things around so I don't want to be like a function you know about a mine I think you should always be able to apologize it's a show at the times I've hurt people's feelings whether the men or women weather that I misread something and and I got a call from somebody said yeah you treated me this way and I think it was a shity wet I called them so quickly because I decided it wasn't getting in trouble I just didn't want

lend yourself to the chorus of of pylon you want to be piling on somebody's already been made fun of historically and I grew up around because it was murdered for being gay but they had that that they had nothing to do with this the promise he went to the prom is Brian's a very gay 51 year old man that you know I don't know but you might know and I drink when you're drunk you're drunk maybe you do stuff you know what I mean maybe you do stuff who knows you've made a pass at me New Yorker can I take your neck and folded over my dick can I tell you something so I feel what it feels like to chew

The young boy right now she's she never lost her she's an asshole schedule like her that's right that's why she's recognized like a dude she's so full of shit yikes what would happen if you got me like that man versus bad boy are you a woman bailing R.Kelly out been a lot of problems PDF being held and there was a woman who said that she was his friend and she actually bailed him out and paid $100,000 so he would be able to go and kind of get his businesses in order before he would get charged and she really thought that he was innocent and said he was going to get out regardless of whether I put up this bail money or not and he's a friend so I'm going to help him out at the time she wouldn't confirm or deny whether the money was from R Kelly or from her and now that are Kelly is not going to be getting out she wants her money back and she had her lawyer go to the judge and ask to have her money returned to her and the judge is like a bunch of Child Support she is not and she knew that upon signing a waiver that's fucked up there cuz she doesn't then that's a lot of money for probably this person I should do it though she said that she was good friends with R.Kelly believe that he was innocent life's not get that good of friends but after she did that her businesses went down she had a restaurant and a babysitting business that just went under what's a lot of money man how it is what it should lock up babysitting business that's like probably the worst thing to have if you're a very long time allfit here's the other thing that documentaries what made everything pop a documentary on it was it life I'm not work I remember when, why what's going on nothing happen right away okay it's good way so a fifty-year-old Long Island judge just plead guilty for raping his neighbor's home he broke into a twenty-three-year-old home who used to work in the Asti office it's not clarified whether she works directly under him but she loved lived right next to him he used to periodically break into her home and take her dirty panties from her hamper and come back home real freak be found out that someone was breaking into her home the police came and actually caught him running out with her panties stuck in his jacket pocket people freaks that's if you don't freak out that people are just into that I just tend to it how much honest his attorney is claiming that he has a mental illness sure like I don't know everybody has her weird fetishes that the promise you can't break and just pay her for her dirty underwear City sounds like a fucking compulsion like one of those things I can't help myself it's like the same sexual disorder that people have that the break-in get into a closet with somebody's home and jerk off too or just jerk off and then leave because it's like a thrill serial killers that go back to the murder sites and jack off on Audible app that's on the youth catching in Syracuse right at school and I do it anymore but that first that's how they got a bunch of them cuz I'd go back to cycling jacket I got your ass Green River murder some journalists car Green River Murders in Japan right into the skid marks I'm sure they'll is that your thing damn it down then you can help it didn't have a racetrack Mark.
