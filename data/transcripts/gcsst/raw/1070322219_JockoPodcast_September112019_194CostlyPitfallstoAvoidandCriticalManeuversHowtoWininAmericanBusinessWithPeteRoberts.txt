this is Jocko podcast number 194 with Echo Charles and me Jocko willink good evening Echo good evening as a leader do you have to put others before yourself and that starts at the beginning and it starts with everything that you do you have to let the men eat first you can make sure that they have the gear that they need you have to let them get rest before you do that's how it works you have to make sure that they have what they need to accomplish the mission and then on top of that you have to make sure that the mission aligns with the good of the troops it's just hard for some people to understand but this applies to any organization the military a business a sports team play and you have to make sure that the troops understand that there may be a short-term sacrifice there may even be the ultimate sacrifice in war men may be killed for the cause but that cause must be just and that cause must even in death benefit those who may have to give that last full measure and that that may sound impossible actually because how can anyone benefit from their own death and the answer he's actually quite simple when military personnel risk their lives they do so to provide Safety and Security for their country the country where their families live and those individuals put their families above themselves and as a military leader if you do see that Omission does not ultimately lead to the Safety and Security of the families of the people that you delete it is your obligation to raise this up the chain of command and fix it been the same thing holds true in business as a leader you must put the good of the troops above yourself now the thing that might seem impossible here is that the overarching measurement of the success of a business is to be profitable and to maximize profit one of the things that you do is you cut costs and one of the easiest places to cut costs in any business these people you minimize what you're paying people are you get rid of people and then you maximize profit so how can this leadership principle work how can you take care of people while at the same time maximizing profit ability in the answer is that you have to look at the long game you have to see that the stronger you build a business the more long-term stability you build and the more long-term stability build the more stability you build for your employees and when your stable that allows you to grow and when you grow your business the employees have the opportunity for growth and those opportunities improve the lives for everyone for the employees for their family and their by the whole Community that's where it happens African what happens when meters that don't put their people first in the military it can result in operations going wrong he can result in senseless strategies and in the military it can result in wasted lives any business you can see another kind of Destruction in business it can mean loss of growth for sure they can mean loss of Revenue yes it can mean loss of jobs but eventually it can mean a collapsing communities the collapsing cultures now of course a balance has to be found and profitability must be maintained but the dollar must not Trump the people and it certainly must not regardless of your capitalistic goals the dollar must not Trump the communities that built the businesses in the first place the pursuit of money must not jeopardize the very fabric of the country that gives us the promise for the unhindered pursuit of that money in the first place and yet we've seen that take place we've seen that take place in our own country in cities in in towns and States we're saving a dollar they closing a mill and that shutting down a factory in places where making more money in the next financial quarter caused leadership to forget the long-term impact Excel the future of those people for cash in hand in the immediate and that disease that plague of greed can spread and it has hurt various parts of America at various times and when that's happening while the people at the top might build themselves a fortune it's a fortunate built on Despair and it's a fortune built on destruction and in the end that will come back to haunt them because it is not the right thing to do and it does not have to be that way because there are leaders who recognized the long-term positive impact of growth and the long-term positive impact of putting your people first putting your Community First putting your country first been one of those leaders happens to be a business partner of mine happens to be a friend of mine and his name is Pete Roberts the founder of origin USA and once again we are in the woods in the foothills of Maine's Western mountains where are Jiu-Jitsu Immersion Camp which means it's time for us to record a podcast and if you don't know Pete then go back and listen to podcast 93 and then listen to podcast 141 and then you can rejoin us here because once again we have Pete Roberts on the podcast Pete welcome back thanks for having that was powerful I was just either you get into that Rhythm and I'm just my head to go I just catch myself going up and down like shit the way you captured what you just said is not trying to say the same thing I said differently but the impact you know when and how important Community years I know how it how important was to New England towns but it's not just New England towns it's all times all people and I mean absolutely right well with the with the standard that were holding a tort the standard is made in America right we see every single day every single day a corner that could be cut we could make a compromise and you know what the profit margins would increase the profit margins would increase a little bit and an everyday you and I get to see that and you're in it you know you're here you get to see if you know five times a day 8 times a day you see a decision that could be made you know what hey we could just get this thing instead in the profit margins go up a little bit every day you hold the line and I think if you didn't like the statement I like to make his well if you if you followed the truck back to the source you're going to end up in a cotton field in the Tennessee Delta Region so if you think that your standard the supply chain is between here and they're like like you said I go yeah we could have died building the boots are the jeans a little buttons little brass buttons the letter tags all these things if you follow that supply chain back you're touching not just your local community but the thousands and thousands of hands it all the communities in between that supply chain and I think that's the easiest place that you could get rid of some of that but it's also the most important if it if you're truly doing something more than trying to trying to earn your way to the top right and I think that in the past you know we talked we discussed this you know what depth in the past you know when you look at all the free trade agreement on that stop whatever's whatever you know the side you're on that thing it was greed it was greed and the people do the work you know yeah there's mines at the top you know and there's mines crunching numbers and designing stuff but the people do the work you know in the beautiful thing that we're doing is we're we're resurrecting that Heritage in I'll tell you what I mean we've been together now what three years has been about three years and going from I don't know what we started at like 10 or 8 I think it was a late people when I went when I came when we merged it was a people so maybe last year we had 25 people there's 50 people now in the factory 50 people yeah you know the and I was telling kind of crew this the other day when we gave the tour you know what city you're saying this stuff right in and I'm talking about being greedy and immediately if you go okay well this guy is not greedy there's like a there's like a point where you say okay well what is he believed in and I actually in my mind I was thinking that cuz you're never talked about how you can't be greedy and then I said listen to I am I am an absolute hardcore capitalist I love deal make him and you get to see me now Virginia business no I mean I love making deals I love making things happen I love making money like it's great. It's it's a it's a it's a great contest it's a great way to keep score you know it's it's fun right and I'm absolutely a capitalist but there's such an easy line to draw a horse sound like it's a hard decision to make and oh I don't know what I should do is like know you you make money but you do the right thing and you make sure that you're taken care of people you're make sure you making the right decision and that's what you do and this is the the the cool thing about it and this is where people make the mistake it's in the long run in the long run you'll do better it's just like leadership just like we worship if you're too carrier people in the long run they're going to take care of you and that's going to be the long-term Victory is going to be better then looking for the short-term Ki barkat if you work for me and I barked at you and you go and do it right now cuz you don't want to get in trouble but you're looking for another job even though I got you to do what I want you to do it doesn't matter long-term I'm going to lose and when I'm taking investment away from the people that actually support the community where we are then that's just a bad decision in Longmont and against short-term it looks might look great long-term what does it look like it's a bad deal it's a bad deal for the community which makes it a bad deal for the country and our country's having a hard time will guess what what if we got Harbor sent you got abandoned Mills and Factory falling apart in these towns 100% so you just talked about growth what he would have you seen from a leadership perspective you've doubled inside in size and I know I sent you the other day at AP going to get to a point where you're not going to be able to really the only got 20 people we got eight people clearly you you I mean families are eight people right when you got 25 people when I were talking cousins and uncles and aunts maybe you don't know all of them that well and it's probably that one weird you know couple you've recruited all you can yeah yeah like you're there and now when you get to 50 people will there's people that you know you. You're just you're just not sure and you don't see him everyday cuz you're busy they're busy there working you're working so you start to you start to rely on you touch a reliable more on your leadership team to carry the message through the company how's that been for you honestly I'll tell you and I don't want this to sound like you know oh this is this is the the only thing you should go by but do doing it when we did when we like when I pushed extreme ownership I'd I had a stack of books and all my leadership and anybody else interested in just hold it to the leadership but anyone interested in being part of this company long-term I want you to read this book I'd recommend you read this book and I had people say while I died I don't read that look cool I'll pay for it I'll pay for 4 I'll give you cash download it and that's why you don't and it's like why don't have time all will put the headphones on while your sewing download it it knowing I got I got you so that changed a lot I changed it changed me a lot and we've talked about in the past but the biggest thing is how important for me decentralized command with the decentralized command and decentralized command in the biggest part of that was I was telling you this the other day like 7800 what do I mean well you got to allow people in Empower people in your leaders to make decisions right and if you can get him to a 70% decision which I learned at the monster also you know when I took it to you can get them their man that's a that's a great thing and we're sitting here in this Pro Shop at the Immersion Camp to get everything here it took it took five or six trucks I'm talking a 26 foot U-Haul at 18 foot trailer another 24 foot trailer and it took a team of 20 people to get everything here and I took my wife Amanda to the to the monster in DC and my father-in-law Joe and Brian are his partner came and his wife Megan and in in we went through it and when you discussed this is always have to be 100% like I feel like I'm going to make a hundred set this is me that's ego talking you know but I feel like my decision is always going to be a hundred percent right and I thought that it was too too dangerous to allow anything less so what I used to do is I used to blank people to buy into my idea you know what I mean idea until they until they could see it but I had to get them to see it to buy in and now it's it's different instalike setting up this Pro Shop I know we were finished early in the morning every sick man your team's you things going early right and I was like yeah they were up at 5 get everything set up nothing but I'm not there right now I'm I'm hanging back there's a few things I got to do here to prep and Amanda's handling at my wife is handling it sound like it's a 1700 if you like what you going to let you know that 70% hotter he's at me like she called me two hours later we're good to go I was like don't think I could have done that done in 2 hours and my hundred percent I don't think I would have gotten it done in 2 hours it maybe would have been another 70% maybe it would have been 65 it would have been able to 80 maybe it'll be an 82 the bottom line any of that discussion argument you know planning would have just wasted valuable time on both ends and it but we did do that we did because I it was the night before I was like but can you see logistically that coming into this camp in the woods you can't get for trucks and I'm like you got to be able to see that you need to this needs to happen methodically you know so as this one's unloading and leaving the next one's coming in so you're saying you did waste time discussing I did I did and then you let it go in an hour ago I said I think you got a good plan I think that's going to work let me know what you need and I got behind supporting the plan that's the way not yet so there's a good example of what you had to do with everything every cuz you can't manage it all because this is no we work with a tassel on front we work with all different companies with obvious you work with startup companies and we see this kind of growth and these are the kind of things that trip them up they get the guy who's a Visionary like you're the big Visionary and then you start saying well I can be your I started this thing when I started going to be in her decision and now all the sudden you look up and if you were trying to make every single decision I was going on the factory it would be a total disaster thousand thousand percent what what has necessitated the the doubling in size this year and it's not just a doubling and people going to give people what else do you need you need space so we got two more buildings yeah man of the new the Thornton Labs facility at the warehouse palaces super challenge dude we I don't know if you remember on that the Instagram I know if you saw that go like all the sudden was flooded you know when we had the spray foam cuz you know this is an extreme environment right extreme hot in extreme cold during the winter but we're trying to get everything into the warehouse It's not insulated we got to go to the heating system in and you know it's just one of those things where you just grind grind grind but we we negotiated a great deal on that property and the next property is going to allow us to expand a little more you know what I think I think that I think we're going to have some challenges ahead of us because we've expanded the three locations but we've almost created a Bermuda Triangle of sorts the way that we secured the locations of facilities it sufficient it's like lean manufacturing of you know in between the factories you know the way you can get from one point to the next to maximize maximize your time but you know the labs facility is awesome and why we should film 500-1000 packages a day out of there for filling I leaned out from a shipping perspective and in the next facility which will be moving into what next week next week if you want to hang out and move some of those machines for the hours are good RX for a fat ass we're all the the shoe manufacturing Machinery be going and the screen printing and some raw materials so 20 2000 square feet are 17000 square feet in Latin of course were chewed up twenty one thousand square feet currently so growing quickly and yeah leadership has been essential and decentralized command essential in that growth and impossible without it and seeing your and I noticed this from you know I'd come up and someone pulled me aside and say Hey you know in chapter for your talk about this you know they'd ask me questions and I just beat it was such a great sign because when people don't recognize how important their job is and how important they are as a leader that's not that just this is not going to work but when someone realizes that they're having a huge impact with every part of their department and that their leadership is most important thing in that apartment when they realize that and they start taking ownership of it that has an impacted and that's what we're good for now saw that early on I saw that early on you know we did like a little a little session and but if you were asking questions during the session but afterwards you know people coming up am I wanted to want to ask this in front of everyone but what do you think about this how should I handle that that joke the people are aware and that's I think that's one of the things that has been I'm not saying they're not growing pains coz I mean of course there's Growing Pains but most of the growing pains are are like almost like a physical Growing Pains so I don't like when you leave when your son grows 4 inches in 6 months and he says you don't hey my niece kind of hurt yeah that's just the physical yes it's going to hurt your growing sorry dude but as far as you know the psychological trauma of all the you know brain damage about this. Everything is very limited right now which is amazing to sit yeah it is and you were talking about people who were leaders prior to origin you're nobody had a leadership position that we had a management position you know in the leaders that we've built their they're not entitled to it and I say it's weird because you got people who go through but say they go to college to be a business management or leadership or whatever there is so much potential and people who just want to work and be part of something there's so they find so much motivation in that I would rather have someone and it went out when I do like job interviews or say I think one of the first questions are you looking for a job you looking for a career and that's kind of a loaded question when I hear I'm looking for a career okay we're going to dig deeper into this conversation out I'd rather take someone who's looking for a career that has no leadership skills and give them the opportunity cuz I know long-term there going to be an incredible asset other company that's the same theory that we have with ef OverWatch with with hiring that's what bring. Batson look a veteran might not have work in whatever industry you're in but that person is hungry they got leadership skills and they got discipline they end especially the group that we are we are they studying trade-in extreme ownership in the principles they know how to lead and we're getting the feedback at we're getting is phenomenal because people hire somebody and they go what did you know they feel like they're taking a little bit of a recipe to the person it's you know if this person that was in the in the Army for 21 years or this person is being in the whatever industry the the the the gas oil industry for 21 years and you think about how we should probably just hire the guy that kind of has experience and we're funding over and over and over again that guess what you take that person that's really hungry that has good leadership skills step into that role they learn the disputed industry-specific and a rock and roll and I tell kids this all the time not not kids but you know college kids college grads college graduates if you're that person that will work hard you can there's so many companies cuz I work with so many companies they there's a drought of people no one's like hey yep we got all the good I've never I have never been to a company where they said yep we got all the good people we need we don't need anyone else we don't need anyone other good people I've never heard anyone say anything ever even companies where you know people are banging on the door to get in big tech companies that have that have popcorn machines in the hallway to hit something I want to work there right there people banging on the door to get there you know what those big tech company say they say how do you think we could get better people that are willing to go hard so it's exactly what you're saying if you if you look for someone if you look for somebody had that has that hunger and I got desire and then actually have to have it cuz we've me there's people like an interview great into your what's your biggest weakness my biggest weakness is sometimes I work too hard right that person and then you show up and they're they're in there in the freaking Twinkie stash so I'm not talking about that. I sometimes I get midweek East Ash I fell for you today bro are you okay I'm good now insulin spike your face was I was I was like I'm going to go lay down I mean I can't literally never eat a donut again if I do I was think there's going to be someone with it with an iPhone over there in the corner and that's going to be the viral the only viral video of Jocko won't be something that activate vitamin D3 5000 name eat a donut that would be a major kind of situation that we have to discuss that's like trees and asked yeah yeah I'll be I have been betrayed very much in fact I've only been betrayed one time but you doubt I would consider that we have to we have to put that in the glamour that would be a consideration of the trail I don't think of how many piece of two pieces of the gas price would start how many did you feed me or did I would just keep shoveling it was busy but I don't think you even know you were taking what is what is like the sweets like part did they have the most I can really like almost wet part that's like that. The honey you don't care sugar syrup but didn't you let the special recipe with the Harry's Diner we are New York City and Harry Steakhouse we're eating with Harriet we sent him baklava in my mom she called me and she's like you sent baklava to New York City to a guy who ate the big rat Riley asked you was you didn't send the recipe did you spend the night another no no I just have to box by she was upset she don't like sending the recipe to make The Baklava. It is it is it a secret recipe and there's one thing that she does to make it as good and I'll tell you what it is after the podcast no one else doesn't she told Spartan recipe are there a special recipe okay so there's got to be demand there's got to be something driving this growth obviously you know and it's been a it's been a continual kind of wrap it in a rapid Conchita just continual product invention for lack of a better work there and and one of the things that you and I were talking this morning I was holding I was putting on a rose getting another Rift ghee and I know not everyone does Jiu-Jitsu but the rift ghee is like it's like a complete it it's like a new product it's like it doesn't exist until now and it's weird to say that about I guess it'd be wondering what's a good what's a clothing product that like completely changed but it didn't exist and now it does I would say that's easy that that would be the compression shirt Under Armour came out with cuz we both like college football remember we had the greys the cotton cotton shirts and shorts are and you wore that cotton t-shirt underneath football pads and then Under Armour came out with the the football shirt and it changed to change the key now you would you're not going to play with this whole thing anymore never wear anything else again right and that's what the rest is like you're not you're not going to what you're not going to cool I'm just going to wear another key today cuz I have it notes no I didn't understand where this key the got the whole thing is engineered brand-new right you I did you do with the football jersey thing like was that an inspiration for coming up with the rift absolute absolutely be because of the performance that we develop this polysynth fiber that hit me know what I'd like to say is you know we we didn't just manufacture it we synthesize that's what I mean like synthesized in Wii and I don't I don't know if I told you how much money we spend on developing this you might get that for me because I probably just did they tell you but you know we had to I think I told you we had to order that you know that children are and we had said you going to set up the friggin Loom and there's 3,000 ends right and it and it takes 60 hours to set it up and then we had to have the yarn spun and then we did it when I it's not good enough so you have all these prototypes you know we've got to get rid of that we've got to get the yarn again it would like it's not Twisted strong enough it spilling too much we need to talk to you and your little freaking fibers individual fibers you know it well it's not abrasion resistance enough until you know it would you take away the Garment itself in the cotton of the Spiral wrap and how it functions in your body and you go right back to the fiber that's where we had to start you know we had to start from that point and then develop the weave the dragon weave gen3 and it's hard to explain unless you put it on course you were down there again like King Arthur like the rift behold and you put it on you know and you'd like this thing is just ridiculous and that was by the way fresh out of the package when you take any piece of clothing fresh out the package it it will in my opinion it all sucks coming out of the package when you take out a pack of Superman you know this doesn't this thing is out of the package it's brand new and you put it on and it feels like it feels like it's been too skinny unicorn yeah something like that so so that's like an example of product moving forward making things at end this is the the other kind of thing is happening because of our sport stuff has to be extremely durable riding so you're making something that just doesn't feel good cuz you can make something that feel good that has to be durable and that's the tricky part right because if you look at the way they make things soft or too few good against the skin usually what that means is there deteriorating the textile little bit right there breaking it down so that those fibers touch your skin and they feel how smooth and comfortable and we couldn't deteriorate the strength of a garment so we had to find a way to do that with the yarn and that's a keys find a way to make the yarn comfortable and then the weave and then make the Garment former on your body the way I explain is like if you took if you took a baseball or lacrosse ball and you took this piece of paper and wrap it around see if you can get a smooth can you get a smooth not even have wrinkles all through it right and that's what basically every key on the planet is like right now if you take that same piece of paper and you just rip it into straight strips and then you start wrapping those strips around that ball would you going to get going to get a smooth surface that's why we called the spiral wrap because it's strips that spiral around your body you know when 7 7 panels and yes animated I don't know if there's another it shouldn't exist that the Garmin shouldn't exist yeah so coming off of that and while you're working on that and I'm all this is coming home from a trip it when I was up here and seen the factory and being you know just kind of in that spiritual High from seeing our people American people working hard like dedicated like passionate about doing it like just seeing everything in action and I was flying home and I remember I was late over somewhere I'm sitting in the airport and I'm just looking at everyone while I'm sitting there and I see that and I called you and I said hey Pete man music how many people do you know that you that do Jiu Jitsu and you're like I don't know a hundred music cool how many people do you know that wear jeans and you said everyone and then I said I'm in the airport right now and 8 out of 10 people are wearing jeans remember the conversation we need to make jeans and you go I've always wanted to make sure she said I've always wanted to make jeans and that was the opening of a whole new game write a whole new market in A Whole New World from that conversation what was the next step from there you know when we had that conversation and I don't know why you might have told me this fact in America there's three hundred million Americans you know how many Americans actually own jeans 298000298 million people own jeans and there's 2 million Communists that don't know. You know it was I knew we could make the product you know and honestly like I always wanted like I couldn't fit Ford nice jeans as a kid and I'm ever going to knock the Banana Republic are the Gap and basically looking at stuff and trying it on and you know it for kids my mom yell $24,000 a year with four kids she just didn't have a lot of extra and we would get like one nice thing before the school year started of course school starts for a kid's my daughter started school today you know when I think about what she has and what you know the hard way the work has allowed us to do for the kids to start school with new pair of sneakers and some clothes and I think about like jeans have always been important to me because we couldn't afford them and it was it was always then it wasn't just a style of it but it made you feel alive it made they made you feel free you know and they've always represented that I mean digging into denim in the around the globe in America if you start connecting denim you see they represent like Freedom Revolution Independence empowerment right they represent these things in I was so damn excited you were on board with it just like yes I think it was just like yep you just needed a little you were like Frankenstein just need a little spark is a bad exactly exactly just turn it on because you know managing you know all these people managing you know the factory couple locations in the growth right because you want to make mistakes you still got to be a little bit naive enough to think you can you can do it though and I knew we could do it cuz we been making this stuff for Combat Sports we've been making products that people yanking on ripping a pulling wrapping around arms and heads with and I knew we had to set up to make durable goods and denim was it to me was like well if we make this it will be the most durable jeans ever made because we're going to apply the same techniques and Concepts we've developed for the past 6 years manufacturing stuff for Combat Sports and we're going to apply the same thing to this and that's what we did and we just did it man I mean I don't even know how to explain it. I mean we got leaves are pattern maker and we just that and I started having to work and I overnight you sample send it back where we should open the first ones weren't amazing they were but honestly like got the text I'll write you know American cotton little bit of strategy. Modern but still super durable and then we started sewing it together with those three needle-like chain stitch machine to know what you just don't find any more know you know you just don't you don't find it it's hard to do that go with two needles than you cut your cost of thread by answer it done and if you don't either. If you go to the store and look at what they actually you have it's usually just one threat hear the scene to know she's the one one machine so and it's easier to cut costs like that is I want us just not what we're doing so it was challenging you know I think it's not just developing a product because you can get in this is across-the-board when you're starting some I knew even though we've been making all these keys and in stopper Jiu-Jitsu it's still a different product and they're still Style you still have to have some type of style in your car that form right will there's there's the jeans out there and it's all all all form right and then you get stuff that's just simply function right in the ideas you've got a balance those two things out you can't be too over-the-top to extreme it's just like bouncing out leadership I was just it's really the same thing Forman Forman function the balance of those two things you know in we didn't get it right right off it don't do it feel like bro this the Oquirrh in the back another bed riser in the back just just not doing it for me I was where do for me too cuz I never paid attention to it before rise you noticed that. Oh yeah I got it I was looking at other genes that I had and say okay here's what's different Emerson I be on like sending you pictures or here's how do you know you would have yolk was but I realized it's like the part below the waistband where it gives you a little separation between their legs of the pants and I did never paid attention to for my life but I looked at as I hate this seems like it's a lot longer than mine right now is there a benefit to that when you're like well there's a benefit and I said oh here's the negative negative I got to pack a pocket on my hamstring right now instead of on my ass cheek which is where it needs to be for my Form and Function right so then it's okay we can type that up so that the the other thing that's weird about it that know that I definitely don't think about is when you make it and when you say okay this is what we are going to produce and you pulled the trigger on that looks like that's what you're going to get so it better be good it's kind of like I do relate in the fact that when you publish a book that you're going to print a hundred thousand copies and then you open it up and you find a mistake and that's that stinks and that's that stings and that's what happened you know who the first those aren't you right there yeah we went into production and they're coming off the line right we trained everybody in I thought we were good to go initially but they started coming off the line and we weren't used to working with your were used to working with like compression textile cuz brother rash guards and stuff we make but not a woven were used to working with nits we've never worked with a woven to all of our machines were set up for Ridgid right text out that don't stretch and like the first like few hundred pairs that came off we started to look at them more intently and we found that we made some mistakes and the mistake was somehow it was the the fabric was starting to grow a grow who's growing because and this is something machines will never be able to do all right machines aren't people they can't they can't make adjustments on the Fly you can only program a machine to do a task and it can do that one Pasquale but it can't recognize when there's something wrong and then make an adjustment right it's going to do one thing one speed one way that's a beautiful thing about humans right in in manufacturing to do it right if they want to do it right and that's it that's a key thing right there they've got to want to do it right cuz they could just keep rolling even though there's a problem and just keep cranking and this happens a lot this happens if the textile that the Garment was growing because it was either being held too hard or the tension of the machine in what way a mixture of both okay you know because we're used to making these rules you know the stuff for your holding it as as they were holding it that the text I was grown cuz there's a little bit like Rayna. It was the whole thing was growing so that the 32 is working offline in there like a 36 is so we had to make some adjustments on the Fly had to change the patterns recut a batch of denim and we just need to know it was the right move we just didn't release it we just like know that's a big tuition payment that's just it's just going to be a tuition payment you knowing and push forward I mean in some of them had to do that is that will cause like the twist in the scene that yeah I like to my son my son has a pair like one of these original ones and he's you know I look I look at me like you look at the things I got to care because he's at school who think I don't care about what I look like my son is just like don't care Outsiders leg rolls with words his shin and if we found an old weed and old research paper from like the 40s leg twist in jeans was the title of it no kidding it's a what what was the cause of that my old patternmaker Lisa she's 63-64 she found the paper she brought it into the factory and is it is a whole research things like a college research leg twist in jeans what it is is that as the textiles being woven that it's called at will and there's no diagonal lines if you look at the jeans I have no lines in order to cut jeans effectively to not get leg twist you have to come in pairs and those pairs have to be reversed opposite and we found that out after close to a thousand pairs yeah leg twist in jeans so you talk about manufacturing a product as simple as genes in I mean what did it take us before we launch to I mean we did it the last man like what's 6 months ago and just launched yet so we finally got to figure it out when we got them launched in I don't know if you know this, I don't know what else to say about the product itself but man those those ladies work I'm saying ladies cuz our hold the whole floor is all women between the ages of 20 and 60 and saw some Sia Millennials work that want to work on that floor cranking cranking and yeah working together and just like a beehive man just like a freaking beehive walking in that place in the morning we're going to borrow if you want me to say it's not but I'm about to we're going to make another pair of jeans just that's going to be lighter weight now Echo Charles you'll just for your FYI the Jocko me I am requesting lightweight jeans okay good kind of well I want the lightweight jeans garage do you want to know why you how many times my legs have been cold you know how many times have been like oh I don't want to be outside anymore cuz my legs are cold and then it's never happened you know I used to wear shorts all the dino all year long that it's snowing outside I wear shorts so black biker jeans I'll be the next next thing we're going to Macon and we've got a little Thai back to my Heritage in the Navy in the SEAL Teams because in the in Vietnam B issued fatigues weren't durable enough for the combat operations at the seals were doing and so many of the seals in Vietnam War jeans and so we're going to make some jeans we've got a cool name for him that I will not reveal a banana okay if I stop answering to let it rip I was like I'm waiting for it like that but like I said the last podcast what you haven't heard yet that that we just did with a seal Master Chief named Kirby Darrell who is just as completely legit as they come as frogmen and yeah he knew he was talking to wear jeans and numb and so yeah I kind of got that we've got these lightweight jeans coming I think it's going to be and I already have a I have a pair I've been I've been testing the goods myself so I spent 30 days in Europe last month I put 200 miles on the boots I think it was 20 thousand miles on the jeans as we traveled and man those things are getting worn in fading in and just the abrasion of movement in Motion in life is awesome that's freaking awesome so and you don't people like why you so damn excited about genes well 298 million Americans own genes because they're cool but it's really what they represent you know what I learned something recently that you know after the grade of before the Great Depression yeah you can go do it old antique store and you see the trunks they got the stickers all over over the postcards you don't know people are traveling to Europe before the Great Depression they were going on vacation for it legal for like a month or two at a time right now in the Great Depression happened in every everybody just kind of hunkered down and they didn't feel confident enough to go on these voyages right ships these voyages so what they decided to do is go and explore the American West and what I've heard is that the Cowboys out there wearing denim blue jeans in in the idea and I'm digging into this through research is that that's where fashion in jeans started in the US so the City Slickers from the East went out west saw the free-range Cowboys have been said yeah and and took that free spirit attitude back to the east coast and there you go I still got to prove it but that's your theory yes yes now I remember this I don't do you remember do you remember like the Berlin Wall you member East Berlin as well as I do I don't know about it yes I do but I didn't get it. I remember watching The Wall come down it was 89 I was 10 years old and 11 years old baby and I absolutely remember I remember may I remember honestly feeling unsure because I didn't understand why these men with sledgehammers were slamming that wall with such anger and then Elation didn't register and I remember the conversation in the house of my parents talking about freedom in communism and I had no idea what these Concepts I didn't know anything about them but then when the Wall came down and they were accepted into the their friends and family watching them come across I was just like they've been separated I just remember that not knowing what communism wanted was or separation or anything I just remember that they were they were they were in prison basically there and yeah of course I was there last month so I cuz what I remember when I was a kid you know at at my school that kids would go on like a school trip to wherever England or Spain or something like that like the Spanish class there be kids would go on a school trip and what people taste like you got to bring jeans bring jeans you are yes you can sell them and there was like a black market to get those things into the Eastern Bloc countries you could sell a pair of American you note standard American jeans that cost $16 at the grocery store at the department store and you can bring over there and sell them for I remember hearing that $100 and I had like two pairs of jeans or three pairs of jeans and I'm thinking hey can you take these can you try and get $100 for these things that was that to me has always said that those people over there identified blue jeans like this like you're saying the east coast to look at the Cowboy and said that's the spirit of Freedom right there and you know the thing is is it on when I get into something I go deep that's why we ended up building a factory in my backyard but I needed I need to understand more about why genes represented Revolution anyways we were in East Berlin last month in working on this project doing some research and I sat down with a woman who lived in East Germany her dad was a spy and you don't they had and I didn't realize they had access to the West in terms of the news in the media and everything it wasn't like they were closed off from that and I think that might be a misconception they could see it but they couldn't touch it right so it's almost like like there their they're in a cage and they can see what's happening outside and what they can't they can't touch it it's a week we sat down and we had dinner in this old Russian restaurant and it was it was like this this scene like you'd seen a movie or something you know with a yellow lights and all the pictures on the wall and we're sitting there intimate like this having dinner and she told me about growing up in the east and as she get got into the conversation she reached in her. In her bag and pulled out her diary from her childhood and she's like let me show you something and she open the diary and there was a tag in there a Wrangler tag and she said this was my from my first pair of jeans and this tag was beat up and Warren in and in her jeans deteriorated but she saved that tag and then she flip the page in a diary she was she had a little bitter and this one's name is Anya Hannah and in her friend had got a New York City and she had written you know in a girl's diary trained and she has jeans and then she took the pain she underlined it's just a highlight and she highlighted it and she's like I didn't really understand how important it was to me until you and I started talking cuz we had talked the day before and she said the first time in my life I ever feel empowered as an individual was when I got my first pair of jeans when I was 13 and I put them on the first time I had only worn dresses what they gave us to wear and I put those jeans on for the first time and I felt free it if you wanted to steal this thing down why it's so important look at that you know what I just realized so I have a I have a 10 year old daughter and she's been wearing your daughter might be too old for this trend but a lot of girls right now that are younger maybe six seven eight nine they were basically a matching kind of hole polyester Nike Dri-FIT type outfit like that's the whole thing right there and it all matches looks like a weird tie-dye looking thing and you know my daughter must have had like three or four of them and she would just rotate them like that's just just just went and her and all of her friends they look like somebody spilled crayons everywhere that's about to be all that's kind of like and I think from a mom's perspective you know it's real easy no just there you go you know just where this and my other daughters my other daughters took her shopping and when she came home she says Dad I'm going to go put on some of the clothes I got and that she had it she was she came out and she was wearing a pair of jeans and it was her first pair of jeans Believe It or Not wow cuz we live in California is no we don't wear jeans out there we wear shorts or you if your eight-year-old girl you wear these outfit these matching little what is it nylon is that what it is what is it I don't know those things like a weight is that a romper Romper your boy looks like that but it's all it's like a it's just a outfit and every little girl wears a super has a lot of it so my daughter comes out of her room and you know what she's 10 you know and she's tall for a 10 year old but all of a sudden she had jeans on and I could see it now that you're I'm connecting you know she looks so proud and you know kind of like she was standing up straight like she was now in you know in the big leagues kind of and she even that time you go through your life or your like I'm a person yes she look like she had that kind of I'm a person I'm an individual I'm a I'm a person I got I'm here, yes I'm here the I'm not Mama's little girl what you want to hear how much of that comes from my daughter's going to get jeans you know what I mean you need to get jeans that's in my kids and my kids psyche that you can want you get jeans and that's when you become an individual human ready to take on the world through that's not us that's so cool it is crazy because it didn't really does you know it really does like it just you know when you wear something like that's the that's the important it's a beautiful thing really you know too that you can be empowered by something on your body you know antenna people that's that's not it's not important you know what you wear will it's really not important what you are but it is important how you feel about yourself and it is important how you project yourself you know it mean if your if your work for Echelon front knowing somewhere you know you were a teacher if you want to Fox News what do you put on I put on a suit why cuz that's what you put on that's right right I think that's important I think the next time I might be going on I might be wearing some or GiGi wax right get a pair of slacks what's another word for that pants or trousers trousers or whatever you two pair of pants those if you get an old pair of pants whatever they they'll change a little bit over time but basically the change that they go through deteriorates them in there no longer usable but genes are different jeans wear and they become comfortable and they come to your body they like they like the world or nothing they wear hats they wear in that out like you can't if one if you have a nice pair of jeans that's broken knee pad for a while it's something happens to him you have to go get another pair yet to go through a. Of time where you at they're not quite your jeans yet and you know what's crazy is is zip codes for thin ones they they tried to make jeans because eventually you didn't have to smuggle them in any more eventually you if you knew somebody out outside and they could ship you the jeans if they can afford them right so they became so popular that East Berlin government decided East Germany government decided we're going to make jeans and they did they made jeans and I picked up a pair of those jeans I found someone who had a pair and they weren't jeans they didn't know how to weave the textile and they couldn't figure it out so what were they were they just like some weird fabric like a it was so weird Fabric and it wasn't even indigo-dyed so they would never they wouldn't even fade in they were just like there's a blue material material yep it failed miserably and she said so the government imported a million pairs of American jeans and they sold out like the like the day they arrived that's the kind of thing where you realize that's why communism doesn't work yeah cuz the state can't figure it out but individuals can so give him some jeans and let him run while okay jeans we got that we might have got a little bit deeper in a little red but hey all right now the other thing you said is you put miles on boots yeah now this is a little bit of a reversal roll when I said you like hey bro everyone wears jeans you said to me hey man we need to make boots not made me that made me nervous because I look at boots I said hey man like these are everyone's feet or different it's hard to make and it's that you got to the sizes I mean you can't handle a pair of boots like boots are what size they are and you in and people complain about blisters and you know in a seal platoon everybody wants a different kind of blue so I was definitely more hesitant on the on the just the product itself and then on the manufacturing to me it just seems like crazy thing and you laughing I don't remember that you were laughing at you like you were allowed to do egg bro it's so much easier to make boots and it is to make tutu weave fabric on a loop yeah and I think some of that laughter was more like I'm ready for the challenge you know what I mean like this is the thing is is you don't just sit in full transparency you know you and I had a private conversation at the end of last year in like okay what are we going to do you know where we going to do to grow and we wanted to make the investment you know of our profit and put it back into the company and and we're identifying where we want to grow right and what's going to have the biggest impact on the community but also with the community can handle right and we know they can handle making denim blue jeans and I knew the community could not only handle but but if we could make Footwear again I just need to click clarify this when you're talkin about the community what you're talking about is the actual Community within which you live and which are Factory is in which we have a pool of people that's the community that actually have this skill set and that's the part that I didn't appreciate and as soon as you you were like Hey cuz I'm thinking how we going to make shoes you said we got the people and then I remember throwing up of course who is up here all these massive shoe manufacturers were up here and obviously okay check run exactly in New Balance is still in Maine doing some stuff Nike used to be in Maine you had you have bashed you right you had Dexter shoe you had Haden shoe Allen Edmonds I mean you had all these brands in one of our employees Christine she actually was the one who went to the Dominican when the free trade agreements win in the play and train them on choose the best little way Stitcher in the country she trained them how to use that machine so she was part of what's called a brain drain at skills drain right where the skills needed to go away I'm going to go way she's the only one left with those skills right and I had identified a few people with those skills and these old shoe dogs one of them was Bart Hershey you know in this old guy Rolling Land shoe dog is the name of that book is that a term anyways shoot off your dogs yet there's a book written that's exactly yeah that's a common term he didn't coined that term no that's what these guys are he was part of that God all these guys helped him get started this guy Roland is the one that helped Timberland start he's the one that had the Machinery in the knowledge to get Timberlands they can mold a sole onto a leather upper she did he develop that and so I had all these Old-Timers who I just honestly I didn't give an opportunity not to not to meet me like I just go to their Factory, on the phone you know showing what we're doing and getting from him get from him get in front of them and then finally we started building relationships in this this one guy Roland I went over there and and he had to get rid of some machinery and we did some kind of negotiating and I was like what do you what do you want you know I got to figure out what somebody wants you know we ended up negotiating he's like can you do a lobster bake from my staff and I said yeah he goes take it all loaded up a tractor-trailer of Machinery as small as I can 20 foot you know and couple weeks ago Joe my father and I and a few other guys from the fact went out and cooked his whole staff a lobster bake Lobster bake for old shoe Machinery but these shoe dogs to shoe dog is a term that is just used as a general term for someone has been an issue for a long time but you know has were talking to be the last year and you know I kind of put your biggest concerns that he's a little bitter for know it's like we can make shoes you know we don't have to reinvent anything even though we need to build it from scratch there's a difference they're trying to figure it out and not have the knowledge that would be one thing but the knowledge is only been it's only been removed for 20 years I have been removed for 50 years I'm not going to say it's impossible but I would have taken a lot larger effort and a lot bigger a lot more costly tuition for yes to wish and they wish it would have been high in the in the effort right now has been great and in the in the expense has been great and we were in the month date and this week we're finally ready to really launch that I got you sign the factory the other day but you're talkin about okay Jocko good job was blessing you know the teams on board what are we going to do a hard one person Henry and he been in the industry for forty years and he started January 1st I gave him a piece of paper with how I wanted the boot to look and I said this is what we want to build now just just so you know everyone understands I know you get it back we're talking about starting something from scratch right we don't have any Machinery we don't want asses in seats which is my way of saying Human Resources we don't have the workflow we don't have the raw materials we don't have the patterns we don't have to go to highs zero I gave him a piece of paper with an illustrator drawing and said this is what we want to make that's crazy not really not really crazy because if you can see when you when you see people work together where each one has a skill set in in and I know this is a gun to SEAL Teams like I'm sure when you'd operations and everything was just moving it's like a perfect but like a Russian ballet it's like a perfect flow of organization right and I had seen it in the rest of the factory and how we did the wrestler Factory that's why I knew we could do it but I but I also knew that the challenges of building something for up would you know that that a foot everyone's feet are different in the Nick I shave their asymmetrical you know it's a strange thing of foot I knew we were going to have channel is asymmetrical the other not the same they're not the same I knew we were going to have challenges and I know I haven't told you about all the commit tuition payments but I'm going to tell you I'm a couple that I may have skipped happened all my money so we got into it and you know when we made some boots you noticed. I'll put it was always you know Henry with an exacto knife like hand cutting everything whatever we started building the patterns they weren't perfect so you can imagine like eight months when I went to this thing he wants once once we actually got a boo of course he started with a 14 wrong and that would bite Us in the ass 6 months down the road that was that was the tuition payment I wanted him to start with a 14 because I wanted to wear it first not knowing that 6 months down the road that would be a mistake cuz you never grade grading is how you scale everything you never grade from your largest size you always great for the middle from the middle-sized yeah so I should have I should have addressed to ask me to cuz I would have said oh yeah cuz you probably lose a little bit of a shape in the and the what's the word out of ratios as you go up exactly that's what grading is so we needed all those things patterns to fit the foot leather we needed the knowledge of course clicker dies to cut the material but mostly we need shoe making Machinery so which these are very specialized Michelle incredibly specialized Mishary said it wasn't feasible to just buy new stuff you know I mean would it have been smartest to buy all new Machinery yes yes it would have been it would have been smartest if we wanted to take that risk and dump that amount of capital in her that I was going to say cuz it's it doesn't seem like that would be real smart exactly but you know what I knew I knew that Henry used to be a Millwright and that if we could just get decent Machinery even old Machinery that was running he could keep it running and our little proof-of-concept called bring back shoe Manufacturing in Franklin County Maine if we could prove that concept it would be only a matter of time to be able invested in that new Machinery so that's what we did and we talked about how much is going to be the eyelid let's do it so I ended up calling this old-timer Mo he's the one that found our first Loom so I went back to the source Moe this is what I want to do and he's wild you know this guy he told me a story you ever heard of Dexter shoe of Court up there was a man named Harold alfond know Harold alfond Bilt Dexter shoe he built it he was working at another shoe company he built it by loading up machines that weren't being used like in the during the night time into his station wagon and driving them to a mill in Dexter he basically took the machines that were like the the abandoned she into this other Factory and he started the factory and he built an Empire the right Harold alfond you got bought out by Berkshire Hathaway they had a contract that when Harold alfond died they can move Dexter shoe out of me Harold alfond died a few years back they shut the factory down and move it out of me this shit just a matter gets to me it gets to me Mo told me a story about about Harold alfond gizmos dad was an old shoe dog and he made the parts for the machine that he said he let me tell you something you're going to need my help doing this this is what I do this guy Harold alfond he started this Factory and he couldn't he could he wasn't getting it wasn't making any money and he called my dad and he said can you come up to the factory and this is back when it doesn't matter if it's small-time or trying to build this this shoe company hasn't even started selling product yet it's in the hole maybe has a handful of employees this guy that mows dad drives up to Dexter 2 hours sits in front of Harold alfond and Harold alfond says can you buy these box of Parts back from me I'll buy them back from you in 3 months and his dad said yeah I'll take them back did the parts back gave him the money three months later Harold alfond bottom back this guy's worth I don't know a billion dollars now but this this thing of sitting in front of somebody having a conversation and building relationships what I found in this shoemaking thing is the most important thing because these are still the guys running it the same guys running it in the in the in the dudes these shoe dogs that have been in the factory helping us combined age 88-90 and we probably had a dozen in there and you should see their freaking eyeballs when they walk in they don't want to leave honestly on occasion bring tears to your eyes that that this is what we're doing because they saw that they were part of it and they saw it leave and just that spark man like honestly just hit me hit me right in the feels man that spark they see it's motivation and I absolutely knew that with their support it was going to be possible and so we've been grinding this the first pair of boots that that I got that you sent me the first rated Beauty sent me was better than the first pair of jeans you sent me that that was a shock like he was like taking out a box I was like no way this is ridiculous and and you know you're like haters there fees aren't perfect I'm sending you so you can look at them and I was like no I'm wearing them out of the box comfortable crazy that was crazy I was like bro what's wrong with your genes dude you know what I mean we're as we had the knowledge base to make the Footwear like it was still here you know in man I mean these guys came in and they just like dump their knowledge on by Henry Henry being the key in this guy Mo and so I'm like I need Machinery so he found all the old Machinery overseas he brought it back over on a shealy bringing Machinery that's been shipped overseas along with the jobs literally were bringing it back to America actually happened actually happening machines designed in New Hampshire machines designed in Massachusetts manufactured right they're bringing them back these old machines and mobile refurbished them and now they're in the factory and it's badass so what's the where we at right now I know we have the the leather for 400 500 pairs yeah you know we we connected with the Tannery that's 45 minutes away that's nothing about supply chain right there's one Tannery left in May and they just happen to manufacture all the leather for the military boots so we went out to them in there like will will help you guys out if we can so they're tanning leather for us there tanning 7000 leather and it took a while to get it right I mean it's you got to remember like leather like textiles depending on how it stand it can be it all can stretch more be more rigid and not form right it can wrinkle you know there's there's all sorts of shit that can happen that that's really bad so anyways we had to get through all of that and we had to get to that make sure the patterns were right and then we ordered the dyes and we started cutting and it was wrong because we had graded them from the 14th so we may have lost 10 or 15 grand hunt dies Geico but but we re ordered the dyes and now we've got them working but but yeah so we have probably five hundred pair of Scott ready ready to go and we leave me facts about the line and we're in the process of training the Young Folks now we have a young girl Nicki she's 19 and other guy who's in there Christine and Henry those two with combined experience like 80 years you know the little wastickerapps tell me about in Henry and were like literally once you and I have a conversation like he should we turn it on will just turn it on what turn it on and we need to turn it on in the factory right now before we move it you know to the new plan cuz it's got its got to work there for a proof-of-concept worked out but man I put I put a ton of miles on those boots and man they're wearing in nicely nicely so it's it's a classic to work boots it's like boots that's what they are are boots boots mens. They go well with jeans yeah I love the fact that we like we're calling the jeans legit fit now while we're doing all this mean while I'm out starting Jocko publishing you know I have a cough Like A Man by the way I've got you know whatever I'm going to be I got a hundred thousand bucks that you know I'm going to need to get moved from place to place we have a fulfillment center they can like you're like yes we do and we'll all the sudden XE know where we got a fulfillment center we got the warrior Kid 3 we got Mikey and the dragons they're your we just absorb that it was like it was one of those things that I gave me the freedom to tell my publisher watch this I'm publishing Beto y got a publishing company now watch this and to have the freedom to be able to do that was phenomenal because I knew I was like okay well I can make this happen because they're they're looking at it going how the hell where it where you going to the waiting to store a hundred thousand bucks palletize books who could have jock or you can get a warehouse somewhere palletizing books you know why you're trying to write another book and do all the other stuff that you're doing that's not going to work in the back of their mind they are thinking I'm an idiot which is which is a common theme around here people think things are impossible and it is another thing I was saying the other day and you were that you kind of reminded me of this of when you see down the path of hey I'm going to make these here and also they're telling you you'd be telling you it's impossible to do this to me it's impossible to do this and the reason that that that that that that propaganda is out there is because the big corporations the best answer that they can give to the American people may say hey why you shut down the factory the best answer that they can give us so it's impossible to manufacture here that's what it is it's impossible to manufacture her that's their answer that way they can save an extra $0.32 per item if I having it manufactured in China where they where they they still have to pay shipping they still have to pay the costumes they have to pay to get it over there's all kinds of it but it's not like they're say it's not like old ghost Labor's only get a dollar a day so therefore we're saving 80 or whatever at $12 an item know they're actually with all the other costs you're saving $0.32 and item by paying somebody over there a dollar a day and my taking a job from an American sending it overseas so will the best answer that they can can get it isn't what we want to make an extra $0.32 about him the best I answer that they can give us this is impossible to do here can't manufacture American manufacturing America anymore that's what that's what we are being told we're being lied to America's being lied to and I honestly feel because of the podcast I feel like you made what we're doing in Maine the tip of the spear I mean in Maine is shaped like the tip of his which is even more badass than it is Old School New England it is always use even more badass but it's not impossible and like you if you look at like we're here at the Immersion Camp I was sitting down with a woman she's in California or sit on the side of a match she's from California and she's she's a cop and she's just talking to me about her struggles about media and how they're making her out to be invokes in law enforcement everything in and she said you know what she said what happened and I said I'm just clicked I'm sitting here looking at this map full of a hundred 200 people from all different Creed's skin colors backgrounds jobs from Farmers to huge businessmen scientist to surgeon all on the mats for a common goal to train and learn jiu-jitsu isn't that what America is together for a common goal isn't that how this country was built isn't that how New England was established when the immigrants came in together for a common goal and it's literally happening right in front of me and I just I just connected into it and I was just like what what's missing will I can see here that this is all about minds and hands right Jiu-Jitsu you know learning Jiu-Jitsu it's not hard it's hard on your mind turning your body it's hard on your hands you know when in manufacturing is is the same thing it's it's it's the same thing in in just understanding like and I know you you know you're from Maine and Connecticut and New England and we both iron understanding where we came from and what was sacrificed so that we could get here I feel like we've abandoned that you know what I feel like Jiu-Jitsu is like ass this spark it all looking at those matches like the spark like whoa wait a second I bet there's every type of political affiliation on Matt's right now. For sure I'll talk to him unbelievable that these people are here smiling and just in sheer enjoyment maybe Jiu-Jitsu can solve The World's problems and I don't know but but I do feel like we've abandoned so much well also when you take a kid and your kid says Hey I want to do this and you tell me you can't do that what is a to the kid what is that do that kids kids well that's where we're at right now you can't do this you can't do this in America and another thing is when it's like I want to build something you can't do it think about that you can't do it and that is an attitude that used to not even remotely exist in America we were busy putting men on the moon and building the best cars and the best ships and the best planes in the world and winning wars and getting after it and all of a sudden we're looking around going you can't you keep the what's a fundamental for all that stuff built built build something and all of a sudden you're being told you can't build something the old you have to manufacture overseas they manufacture better no no this is our blood we build things and when you take that away from someone where they got this wrong this is wrong so I actually I actually like a little bit of the propaganda it just helps forward you and we can just sneak up behind these folks and choke them out yeah. And it doesn't stop there we're going to we're at we're in a war on all fronts you know we got on top of all this we got to work in labs and we put out tons of new product Edwards in labs from but you don't whatever me and I can talk about that all the time then do cracks and you were out but from a business perspective I think one of the biggest challenges has been the go ready to drink in a can again it was one of these things where hey we want to make a drink that gives you energy but is not freaking horrible for you which which which may seem like that's impossible that's impossible because you needed to taste good till it's got to have sugar you got to have it not be refrigerated so it's got to be have a bunch of chemicals in it to keep it from going spoiled and then you got to put 8 billion grams of of caffeine in it so it at least convinces a person that's drinking 10 billion grams of caffeine a day that this is actually hitting them so it's all these hey that won't work no no no that was the first thing how do we actually make something that I could look at a person and be like you should drink this it is good for you to drink this it will help you in your life in your brain in your athletic Pursuits right now but that's a big step it is you know what's funny is like I remember the last conversation before we actually pulled the trigger on making a decision and you were like I'm not compromising we are changing the category like this is poison you know that this category the energy drink category energy in the registry poisoning we're not conforming to the standard and you you may like it it's going to be as far as the caffeine thing when you kind of set that bar like I was I was on board you know it and you know the thing is is like I'm not a big happy drinker but and I know you're not a big happy drinker but literally like I would never ever allow my kids to get an energy drink are you kidding me you ever I think if I gave my kid an energy drink that would be made under the world Mayhem yeah so you know what I mean just being able to make that decision we're not going to conform and we're not going to compromise you know I mean that that started the challenge you know what and the other big one was was how do we make these things stay fresh without the normal chemicals that they add to all these drinks that keep them for up to keep it from being spoiled over that's like woo-hoo let's do what they do with my arm with milk pasteurization pasteurization and so how many other drinks are there that you go into a store or you order are you pop open a can and it's pasteurized what's the number of drinks like that thing Baton Rouge 00 again what's the with the business decision a business decision well it's going to cost a lot more going to cost a lot more to pasteurize e-cigs it's going to cost a lot more to use monk fruit instead of whatever the freaking cancer carcinogens that they just pump into those things know we're going to use the best ingredients so all those little decisions along the way we could be wrong actually we could be wrong it's worth of tuition payment I was going to say if we're wrong at least I'll be able to sleep at exactly and I think that's what when you distill it down that's what it that's what you get right is hate you know you can cut Corners in the way you started this you can cut Corners here there the other place but what is the right thing to do you know like with a jean what's the right thing to do while build a product that's going to last a lifetime that's actually the right thing to do that'll never fall apart right in the same thing with with all the nutritional stuff because there's so much junk and you know my son 16 I will only let him take more protein or the warrior kid either one of those I'll let him take I want to touch you have a shih tzu B-17 my daughter has turned 14 you know it's like there's things that are exposed to and there's propaganda in ascenda Street pushing this poison at kids and honestly like they're at the point where they're mobile you know I know your son's mobile to where they're making decisions stopping at the store grabbing things to drink grabbing snacks and I actually am on them all the time would you eat today would you pick up at the store would you drink today you know I'm on them about it cuz I know how important it is to me that they make good choices with the occasional be no double cheeseburger at McDonalds which I may partake in once in awhile but yeah there is a you don't usually find that in in the categories in in in this industry in the nutritional that you're fine people looking at those things and I think that ultimately ultimately Odyssey without your podcast I think it would be almost impossible I think it would be almost impossible without without you explaining the people what's going on here well then you might as well so it's not really the podcast people are listen to the podcast short not me it's the people that listen to Podcast Addict okay yep we're on board that's what it is yeah and so thanks to everyone that listen to this podcast cuz otherwise we wouldn't be doing much of what we're doing right now no absolutely I mean it did you get all these you know these Netflix specials and stuff you know what like what makes you fat or like the truth about sugar you know all these things is all these new so there's there is kind of Awakening I guess I would call it a wakening about what you're putting in your body it's happening it's happening and I think you're a part of that Awakening I think you're a big part of that Awakening letting people know hey you got to watch what you put in your body but I'm going to make something that I want to put in my body you know and I think that's a you know that value proposition that use undeniable you know it's undeniable when we're not going to compromise on that that's undeniable and if it doesn't work out at least we did the right thing that's undeniably that's like chasing the truck back to the cotton field that's where you're going to end up so you can argue with it cuz I think the right decision my wife the other day I came home and she says do you have a Vitamix blender or like a high-speed blender do you have to have a blend is it located one of those like big high speed blenders like a ninja I don't know but it's a big like it's almost like an industrial blender so I can so I have one of those and the other day but I normally don't use it cuz I just use a shaker cup right when I'm making some malk of whatever flavor so and everyone in my family just uses shaker cup occasionally someone decides to kick in the the the Vitamix so I come home the other day and my wife goes you know she's not going high and then she says I had strawberry milk in the Vitamix and and and she said she said that it's the best thing I've ever tasted in my life so my wife said she just she said it was so frothy The Rock and when I saw it cuz my wife you know she's up she's a world a worldly person I guess you know she likes to got out fine palate and she likes dick all different kinds with it I'm not that right for me to be like this taste good if it has limited Merritt Road can I ship can I share the wooden sword thing the wooden sword guy was so I can I can help us this day in the picture of Helen go ahead weight when you're like hey we need to build a wooden sword we're on the phone the other day we need to build a wooden sword do like that especially little wooden sword at a pet her in the windshield and the back in Action cuz I want a little kids to have Shields and swords in wooden which is an awesome I'd least like the only thing I played with until I figured out that there was a machine gun that I had a great idea would you do that for like this Christmas or something like build wooden swords or what am I keeping the Dragon shield yeah that little dragon on it be badass do if I was a kid that got that yes I'd be chopping and everything I don't know that looks that I mean we had wooden swords as kids but then they turn them in the phone yeah I was just say that's the thing is now they make them phone him because then you can't hurt anybody which I get I'm leaving to maybe need a parent your kids and say hey Billy don't hit Jennifer in the head with a wood sword but I don't do that it's called parenting let's try it or you just put a helmet on him and put foam everything and put them in a padded room and now we don't have to worry about getting anymore. So she acts all that stuff together I mean it's it's growth right now when you look at the growth right now I mean do you see any hesitation in the Grove 0dc acceleration the girl yes you are you are you nervous I think I don't know nervous is right word you know I mean number one I love the process and I hope for the process never stops I don't I mean to think of something ending like what we're doing I just know I say what do you have for decades of opportunity and I've I've told you this before you know one of my advisers John what happened introduce you to the next time we're Farmington said hey hey you got four Decades of opportunity you know your first 20 years you learning you knew got 40 years to do and then hopefully you enjoy the fruits of your labor you know in and I'm in I'm in a second decade night 20 to 30 30 to 40 turn 14th February 2nd decade like the process man and the process is what gets me excited being in the game you know not standing on the sidelines not being a former player watching you know the new blood play I love being in the game did Owen and I think that to be in the game you're going to be a little bit nervous you're going to have butterflies because that's what being part of the team is that's what being in the game means and if you do and if you don't have that then that you've your arrogant and or maybe you're complacent right but if you're in the game you've got to feel that thing that's driving you to get up every morning you knowing and I love it I love it you know that's truly my passion is being in the game not with the not not winning the game not winning the championship not looking to to an end goal like if we achieve this we won you know it's it's just it's just if we achieve this what can we do next to Zach looking we go from there exactly I look at one thing that I like doing and I like being a part of and one thing that I like about working with you is it doesn't seem like I can say hey I think we need to do this and I know that it it's going to be really really hard but we can do it and you're like oh yes we can you know as opposed to the nine reasons or the twelve reasons or the 47 reasons why while you know there's this problem is that problem there's this problem is that problem is I never I never hear that from you I know you don't hear it for me and I'll be I'll know it's hey this is where we're at this seems like it would be crazy to do let's do it yes here's how we can make it happen yeah in to touch on that and the fact that there has been this propaganda delivered to our minds over the past 20-30 years whenever it's been I was talking to a woman recently and she's the one that saved that first allume when when the Chinese came in and they purchased off this meal when losing the main they pulled everything out she save this Loom I don't know podcast actually change Rachel and the biggest thing that that build the infrastructure for the New England Mills where the canal systems and if you pull the stones out of like the canal system in Lewiston you could build another Great Pyramid if you pull the granite out of these Canal system you could build another Great Pyramid think about what they did a hundred years ago in Lewiston Maine they built a Great Pyramid in the form of a canal system and they did it without technology they couldn't look up leg twist in jeans and solve the problem right we can so to say it can't be done I never say that we've got technology we've still got people that know we've got jets that can get us you know you can jump in on a JetBlue flight and get to Europe in 8 hours or 12 hours if you need to go see how something works or if I need to go to California if I need to just drive to Lowell Massachusetts I mean you have the opportunity to travel quickly you're not getting on it on a boat on the ocean then that's what they were doing they were transporting the stop with horse and on Rails across the ocean and you telling me it's impossible you freaking kidding me this is the easiest time we've ever had to do this and that's why it's not crazy because of what we do have are fortunate to be in a day and age where we can get information like that you know it's just a matter of putting hands in dirt that's what people are scared of you know they don't know how good calluses feel if they did let it be a different and be a different world right now so again fortunate and in being in New England being in this part of of Maine knowing that that feeling may have been abandoned or the people may have been abandoned and showing him know you haven't been abandoned actually this is cyclical and in we know that we're still the best at this let's just make it happen again let's get back in the game let's get back on the field let's make it happen again just being part of that let's get to work let's get to work awesome seems like a good place to wrap it up Echo Charles it's how's it going over there pretty cool speaking of getting to work yeah we like to work in various various modalities I have never heard that work really modality modalities and I love expanding vocabulary explain it to me different modes modes that would be might be want to get smarter right we want to train our brain right we want to train our our aerobic capacity sure we want to train our defensive capabilities yes we want to train our strength we want to train our reflexes I mean we're just want to trade in a bunch of different modalities do you know anything that really helps across a broad spectrum spectrum of modalities like that Echo Charles and what would that be another Indian version cap immersing immersing ourselves right that's what we're drinking Mercy do everybody's ripped off Immersion Camp now oh really oh yeah yeah yeah yeah all the who's who of Jiu-Jitsu or doing immersion camps okay flattering that's awesome hopefully more people are training immersing themselves in Jiu-Jitsu cuz yes very useful as a modality of improvement for sure mental physical vocabulary vocabulary tonight across the board yet have you little mercy of modality do you get immersive mode out that you brought up super Sako I'm going to interrupt you even though this is your time not a nice art our time cuz you know what we did for you the last four days did you connect the dots we know if I know you know you got to give you when you got here yes you know who else got those keys yeah Jocko what do you mean what color was it did you see anybody else get Blackie Jocko else I don't know all the other instruct all the other black belts if you had if you had peripheral vision which I don't mind you would have known was it what was about to happen if chocolate right now okay I'm back home at Slayers right there because she was concerned do you think he's going to know and I was like now I just think that it's the camp key or something by the way podcast about that we use for the X the blackmail experts you being one of them you know like when you watch Fight Club you don't hear what I want to look at you getting all your call yesterday. I'm experiencing right now if you guys talk about the black or otherwise that is a reinvented scenario right there really good and the thing is I I do preferred and Oogie over a fever that other one the other the one that I got cuz I got to risk another one that looks did it looks different but it's an elephant, but it's also the same material yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's a special thing we've had to guess the primary mover in that gif feeling so good I guess at the cut is also a factor but the bigger factor is that material to text that's ridiculous cuz it's like I'd say that dries as you sweat if I can sleep in layers when you get done with that then it's almost dry right then you could put on the bat so that's it for anyone that had a new key before like in 5 years people be like oh yeah used to suck use that to like dry these things for 80 minutes. It was a call when I was a kid I used to have them on the phones were attached to the wall that's really horrible you know cuz I know I used to get my key in the dryer for an hour and a half to get it dry all that must be contributing to the softening of society by make no sew Nightrain more now listen to Jazz I asked you get a risky Anton unless it makes me want to do morgie just that little push I think that's something to see if this is what does that you have someone that is very focused on Comfort a little extra Comfort goes a long way to stretch out I would assume they are not wondering what do you get you get in Origins cuz it's not just the rent the whole Spectrum while you're here okay, give you some snares I just started yet to I'm not looking to compete I'm going to train three times a week my budget is tight what day should I get I would go with a comp atleta okay which is still going to do the performance or is we have that wore your language to light Wiki but as it's more bill for warmer environment seat of the compound let it really is that right G to go look at him yeah I'm I'm training 6 times a week I'm going to compete I have a tight budget 6 times a week going to compete tight budget I'd still go with a cop Atlanta okay at what point do I step up and get a rift at what point do you want to improve tell you honestly right now if my budget was tight I would wait an extra two months and get a rift yeah that's what I would do if it's a game-changer product you know it's not it's hard to explain man like it like it when your underneath somebody know it would like we're an old key let's say you're going to need somebody inside control you been sweating the whole match your 10 minutes in and you need to like elbow Escape or hip out in your arm stuck inside the sleeve because of the abrasion of the detector what you're going to feel as free you know so it gives you an advantage in that regard if you want to feel free on the mats even when you're getting crushed in smothered get erect all right it's in Advantage it's it's it's a way to cheat the system yeah yeah yeah that's a whole comprehend exactly like you so much as you like that right the freedom of movement and everything and in the end he also has almost provides that for you you know when your major version of covering up his arms as well because there's a massive check also we got what we just talked about jeans origin jeans order those up we got t-shirts we got other clothes and we got supplements can you get all the different supplements yeah so I had to I got the new which we haven't talked about yet cold or yeah warehouse work all this is just now we're talking about inside okay so I got some of that cold cold war krill oil joint Warfare the prerequisite supplements this is like to keep you in the game late does about you have you can have huge strength all the stuff but you if you can't keep yourself in the game if you're on the side length of the injuries whatever you're sending me all this stuff doesn't even matter so anyway I had that Don Don me how these are the most important supplements that there are in my opinion you could possibly not be in the game be the strongest not even in the game bill you can't roll yeah I guess whatever your neck is sore it's so what I don't even know how to the Joint where friend I'm almost ready to go there you go tell you how the cold cuz she was getting off the airplane or something or you were traveling a lot I just work all right and I'm like guys almost got sick I need like a hyperboost of you know the all the stuff that prevents you from getting sick and Brian's a cool let me blow me figure it out yeah we ran it and then I tested it and I'm like okay I've been traveling whatever was six weeks no sickness that's that's like it when I say sick you know you know when you travel into just like your nose you just you just like wake up your mouth taste like crap and you feel like you're about to get sick. I got to like that it's pulling you out of the game but it's infringing on the game it's got everything. So there's all that stuff also what mohawk have to see you don't need milk okay maybe baby. But you kind of need more cat so that's if that is the greatest name ever mulkin yes I mean it's you know there's this borderline you know like just you were talking the other day about this borderline genius or the worst idea on the planet Mulk in the genius category you know what I mean are you doing this is genius yeah it's fitting in it it is inspired by malkit self smoke came first and then mokave the drink came and it was so good I remember telling you guys this is not approach this isn't a meal replacement this is its own thing and it's tasting me like Mulk by CCB influences in there for me where the monk fruit right right right kind of like Hulk right cuz I knew you were going to mint green cir and then of course Motorhead over the old cuz that's just legit they ask me why he put the umlaut over o in Motorhead and he's at cuz it look cool like that was his answer all lights white and anyway it's not like something you wear around your neck like a little thing I thought that those things are called the ambulance and we could do it put put the put the phone light above it put the two. Signs if I don't have to do that on the computer and you like hold down this key and fresh fish feels like I'm home. Who used to be a pretty important part of my texting sometimes I'll be texting someone I like my my phone autocorrects like m o l k m o l k all caps that's what it auto corrected it in bulk for the so there's a law that explains her to do that yet you can change it and mine also the other thing I had when I write JJ did you just say so that way I don't know about Jiu Jitsu with a hyphen in there every time you got to change the keyboard not religion since you did to go to be honest I didn't know you could do that yes you can probably the two that you actually need to smoke and Jiu-Jitsu every as you typed Bulbasaur because even like responding on Twitter it works so I just hit JJ missed you get there so you must get a lot of questions like what do you need to be successful in life like vulkan Jiu Jitsu by the way yeah yeah cannot say discipline and I will say that is it cheating that today I'm going on how many hours of sleep none not a lot and and I was tired coming when you when I said today I have some planning I was like okay tonight and go to bed early and I want to go to sleep and wake up in time to feel great and I should suit you want to record tomorrow you like we're all tonight in my mind I said to myself damn that sucks and then but I wouldn't ever like reveal that I'm kind of tired tired to record a podcast no not so but I'm in case you can tell Shane he was kind of tired coming in and then I drinks of the D will the Jabba disciplines coming along way you don't we cut the power of course yet right and then what pills powder pills yeah drink tonight I wasn't going to have a go tonight yeah and then I was like I'm going on Jocko podcast I need a little extra help me perk Dave birkett to podcast back to back in and took a couple days off the Record another two back-to-back any before each podcast he was taking to discipline go and he's just like their mom 2% music on Rainey my a game watch this did you want to know something that feels real good my son came in and he was meeting with your with dr.

kettlebells battle ropes rings Macy's steel building all this kind of would you call that new age workout is up now I want to watch directions to Bill's how they kind of came back with a vengeance or send you a leather medicine ball that we were making know you did not send you what I saw one in the Mountain Trading so you kind of let you know any good workout in there the other morning yeah yeah I did have a good workout this is the day that I slept yesterday that I could have slept okay so Echo was we we had a long we we flew from California to Boston we work or no cup podcast to Boston once we got done in Boston we drove it was a early late night early morning joke to main thing we stayed up late that night for some reason to oh yeah then we went to your house and we hung out then we went back until we got to bed it was not later tonight we had to bed at like 10 or 10:30 so I wake up in the morning I'm in Maine I'm stoked I'm at the mountain training facility and I go downstairs you got and it was one of those things I just had this figured out a good little workout with the equipment at a time when you guys out of the Bold Bulgarian bag 28 kg kettlebell which is which is in between I have 24 x 32 so I had a little meet you know this is little mix it up I was going to up the wraps you know and to try some other movements and turn down there getting after its 4:30 I get done with that and I was cracking up some music I was cracking up some old rock and roll little some Danzig some kyuss and then it just plain whenever I get done I go upstairs shower get done and I have two documents I got to edit to edit these documents and you know it takes a while to put too legit full document some editing get done with that and then I look at my watch shows the morning we talked for like two hours we talked for two hours after I don't work at I went for a run I actually know that's why I pray for nice long run and I look at my watch the indeed and an echo are still asleep and I go that's where that you still asleep and it's 2 is 12:40 in the afternoon and at first I know movement I send my text so I sent him a text saying hey are you guys alive like kind of calling him out and then I think to myself wait a second maybe it's been 14 hours they must be damned hey I sleep less right than a normal person cool I got some weird genetics who I sleep 5 hours this is three times that right there is no way a person is either long I think is carbon monoxide a cold bodies I go in there and they're just like that cuz you know I got was really tired on it yet on Industrial get the cool stuff kettlebells they did come back I do have a 28 pound or kilogram kettlebell I think what 62 I kind of liked it man from I kind of like the way I kind of liked having a little intermediary the problem is I can go overboard with stuff as we know what yet I'm hungry so we're supposed to get like I'll have every kettlebell imaginable I have the whole spectrum and it's worth it because like you can modulate like throughout the whole work out there should be doing kettlebells which I highly recommend by the way do kettlebells Pete I'm just started recently just so just like swing you should be swinging a nice lightweight she got your back situation is swinging nice lightweight and it is so good for you man it feels good you don't think about cannabis light but you think to yourself or whatever I got my 40 kg kettlebell no fact I'll swing this thing you know it's going to be pretty easy and the first six of them it is you like what is this mean by the time you get to 16 you like okay then you get to 24 and you're like okay yep I see what's going on yeah yeah kiss Goodman and you going to the rowing machine you got a different rowing machine but on a concept 2 rowing machine when you start you like having a blast this thing out and it takes a minute for your for your energy system was that First Energy System that you're using 2018 ATP that immediate Sprint one and you're like using that and but then it gets used up with you but you think you're Superman for the first you know how many meters do you usually well it just depends what I'm doing just depends what I'm doing you know and I use it usually for sprinting I'm usually not in there for 20 minutes when I couldn't run cuz my knee I was rowing a little bit more and I was using it minimum I wasn't going full range of motion but anyways so how long you going on 30 minutes, I tried to 8000 say yeah yeah where you had a great workout that was our original Factory on all the big Timbers and stuff on corn and his I've been working out in the evenings and I did one the other night it was I get home and it's really late and I just kept all the lights out and I Road in the bin a pitch-black could you see the monitor or anyting know and I just rode until you felt that I wrote and I actually wrote against my shadow because it was just a little bit of light behind me casting a shadow on the wall and I just was just like chasing my shadow and it was the best workout I had no idea how long I had Road I just knew like 30 minutes I set the timer for in the pitch-black in which brings you did set the timer my phone timer just went off went off boom so and you had no idea it is exactly Shadow getting at yeah yeah it was sweat it sounded like a I got some books I got a new book leadership strategy and tactics Field Manual that is available for pre-order right now if you want to get a first a dish that you should order it right now if you don't but doesn't matter what you do is that hard copy or oh yeah how it is yeah yeah yeah it's not the same size as the original Field Manual it's smaller so that people can carry it that's one of the things that you looked feel very well do we want to be able to carry it I'm like yeah probably just want is to be used in the field leadership what are some of the chapter names it's broken down like this there's a t chapters holy shit but they're short got to quit hitting chapters of where you go ahead it's all about leadership it's my boss is micromanaging me what do I do how how would this work for for some of my my floor managers because they're plugged into the training program the echelon front training program the online program which is been awesome you know but it would be nice because they can't they can't like beyond that welder operating income operators right well the operating but if they did have like a book you're that it was like that I think is what it is that's why I made it another thing is I used to be able to say if someone said hey you don't know these principles what do I do if my if I got a guy that's if I got a guy that's got a lot of potential but he's not doing what he should be doing what should I do and I should just be able to say just listen to the podcast and you when there was 20 podcast recycle call you know you listen to podcast now if I tell someone I know the answer is in the podcast I'm basically a signing them over 500 hours in appropriate right so I had to take all this information in like distill it down so you can say he just look it up it's highly indexed okay so you can just look up that's cool with subject and boom goes so totally pragmatics so would if fervor like our our managers are for managers would you say that the book replaces online training or they serve two different purposes they serve two different purposes here's the fax you you are you don't get good at anything through One Direction of training how much better you at how much better you in an arm lock if you learn it from four different instructors oh yeah how much better are you at any learning a subject if you learn three books about a subject instead of one infinitely better it's not just better it's exponentially better because you're able to compare and contrast what you learn the first time with what you learn the second time you see it from another angle so you see a one-dimensional you see 2-dimensional on the third time you read a book about the same subject you see it from 3rd Dimension the fourth time now you're seeing the fourth dimension of things and that continues to go so all these things so that all these things are an effort to give the different perspectives and different angles on these subjects because the better you get at them just like training Jiu-Jitsu if if you eat the more you eat the more time you spend on bottom inside control the better you get at handling it the more time you spend dealing with different leadership problems the better you get at it the more different angles you can see the better you get out of it so that's the purpose but I would say the initial idea was like listen people need to be able to apply these principles a need cuz there's nothing people read extreme ownership they they actually understand the principles they can explain the principles back to you what is far as overlaying those principles and even overlaying the examples on to what they're dealing with sometimes people sometimes some people have a hard time making those things overlay properly and so here it is instead of saying here's the principal over late on your thing and here's what it will look like right now when you put it there it's more it's more direct you don't have to you can do less you can you can you can it's just more direct so that's the leadership strategy and tactics Field Manual I did just get a note from my publisher and they said this was superb superb herb and your superb that's especially from a publisher that reads books all the time and they don't have to send you that note like this is from someone at the publishing company that doesn't doesn't just send out notes right so it's for sure they probably right in or applying the strategies yeah yeah I probably like okay I'm going to use just now totally I also way to work at 3 where there's a will you can get that right now way to work at 1 Mark Mission how many people at Camp how many books how many Warrior Cat books are you seem to be signed at Camp all of them all of everybody people after people after people those books you're having such an incredibly back it's so amazing to see I don't think there's anything that makes me feel better at this point in my life than getting showing us a parent showing me a video of a little kid doing a pull-up and then looking at the camera and saying I'm a warrior cat in a sweater just doesn't get any better than that I've been signing were kid books to buy the rest of us if I didn't write it by the way he signed a few that's awesome I took the picture in the back that's something we're working at now that's another field NATO that's when is directed at you individually how to get after it the audio version is on MP3 it's not on Audible extreme ownership and I got him a bishop the first two books where you learn the principles you have to know the principles if you don't know the principles applying them doesn't make any sense to you so extreme ownership is a Coterie leadership get these principles into your head so that you can apply to at your business at your life they work they work that's another thing I hear all the time from people they say you know I be used if it works it works I'll give me a specific example of how it works I just had this customer called me and they said blah blah blah blah and I said you know what that's my fault and they said you know what I probably should have given you a better heads up it works it works we got our leadership
