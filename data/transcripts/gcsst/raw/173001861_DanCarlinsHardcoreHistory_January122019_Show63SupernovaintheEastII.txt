want to get too frustrated with me referring back to things we talked about earlier please feel free to listen to part 1 and catch up you don't care about those things of course or if you've already heard part 1 well please feel free to continue and hopefully enjoy a part to a supernova in the east its history it's hardcore history why did Adolf Hitler and the Nazis broadcast news and updates of what they were doing as part of the final solution while it was going on and why didn't they announce to the world for the Joseph Goebbels propaganda Ministry that we have set up these industrial killing facilities but we'll work people to death first if they're strong and and explain listen last ones we killed a hundred thousand more of these people and we won't stop till they're all gone why did they do that why didn't Stalin get up there and yell and shake his finger and threaten the gulags and then explain what the gulag archipelago the whole system was starving to death work you to death that's part of a re-education campaign and all you have to do is leave the country and come back for us to be suspicious enough that you've been corrupted to send you away I mean why did he get up there and say this is what's going to happen to you if you don't stay in line I want admitted it right why didn't the Khmer Rouge take photographs as they wiped out the intellectual class of Cambodia because they thought people with glasses were intellectuals and the intellectuals were threat to their new world that they were creating where he was going to go live back on the land again why are there photos of that go check out The Killing Fields you know what you'll find artwork why didn't they take photos full color blown up and put them all around the town and send some to the for media Outlets to that's what in the Syrian king would have done back in the Iron Age get a guy likes inaka rib going to level a place like Babylon and then he's going to make sure everyone knows about it in detail now a good historian of that era will point out that a lot of what the Assyrians carved into stone including their version of photos right artwork with commentary and statement by the king lot of that stuff was a court style after a while in other words it was what everyone would expect while you still see a Egyptian fashions in the New Kingdom that look you really familiar like Egyptian fashion from the Old Kingdom there's a style that becomes the style you use but what does it say about you if V style you use is to announce the atrocities that you commit and as close as possible replicate them on the walls of your waiting room in the embassies while people wait to talk to the Assyrian ruler I mean Sanaa Caribe destroyed Babylon and wrote about it here is what the scribes record the words of Sinatra being again this is a court style also but what a style sennacherib said of his leveling of one of the great cities may be the greatest city of all time if you started a top 100 list Babylon and he leveled Babylon in the 600 BCE by the way quote like the oncoming of a storm I broke loose and overwhelmed like a hurricane would their corpses I filled the city squares the city and its houses from its foundations to it stop I destroyed I devastated I burn with fire the wall and outer wall temples and God's Temple towers of brick in earth as many as there were I raised and dumped them into the yuraku canal through the midst of that City I dug canals I flooded it site with water and the Very foundations thereof I destroyed I made its destruction more complete than that by a flood that in days to come on the side of that City and its temples in its Gods might not be remembered I completely blotted it out with floods of water and made it like a meadow and quote all those later kings were probably trying to emulate the badass of the mall I should Nasir Paul II from an old couple centuries before that time the less you got to appreciate the Assyrians for owning it and using it their foreign policy was based on scaring the hell out of people they want you to Rebelle in the best way to do that was to punish anyone who did Rebelle horribly now that was more the style of the times in the Iron Age though one could see that not playing particularly well in the twentieth century but then let's ask why if you were to make a list of all the genocides and attempted genocide atrocities war crimes and all these things into that would fall broadly under that heading and involve enough people to sew to make a list of the 20th and 21st centuries how many of the let's just call them accused perpetrators of these acts admit to it own it and if they do how many of them do so in an unqualified way because sometimes the evidence is so overwhelming that even in the deniers can't figure out how to wiggle out of the box so they start rationalizing and they'll say what the numbers are inflated or there is mitigating circumstances or what have you and here's what makes life so complicated sometimes they're right if you look at the history of the twentieth century you will know that we start off relatively quickly with some of the more famous genocides or attempted genocide or alleged attempted genocides in history and we keep going from there we have spent more than a hundred years now is a global Society trying to codify rules and laws and courts of adjudication and systems and organizations to help create rules about atrocities in war and genocide and killings and crimes against humanity ryuk you could create a timeline we could start you can start before the Hague convention some things like that but what you go all the way through you know that the League of Nations creation you can get to the United Nations creation you can get to the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials there's there's all these sorts of things and now we have this extensive body and many of these Global organizations created in large part in reaction to horrible atrocities and genocides and think that must never happen again let me ask you what you think would happen if it happened again and spent an enormous amount of time and human effort on an on a fantastic cause right let's never have a final solution for example happen again what happened tomorrow of course if this is going to be some sort of analogy that works we have to imagine it happens in a in a powerful state that happens in Albania they'll be no problem the bombing will start you know soon afterwards and they'll be an invasion if it involves if this crime against humanity involves an important ethnic group that's in many countries are there many countries have an interest in this a Jewish folks are an example of that then it's going to be different kind of situation if we're talking about a people that almost nobody really knows about in some Faraway place and they're being persecuted by a powerful State the ramifications of confronting it would not be like Albania you'd be committing to some major stuff do you think we do anything different today if Holocaust number to starts tomorrow if it's China or Russia apologies to both those Nations but I mean they're the obvious powerful choices if I'm not going to choose my own state if they start killing a million or two million of some unpopular minority there the most of us in the rest of the world don't know a lot about I don't have a whole lot of dog in that fight how well are all these wonderful organizations that we have created over more than a hundred years how well is this mechanism going to click into place and function to stop something like that the people at the time get quite a bit of blame for not doing more to stop the Holocaust or atrocities that happened all throughout the second world war on many major fronts but I think we sometimes forget how hard it is to do that we have many more mechanisms and tools at our disposal created in many cases specifically for this purpose that I still think and remember I'm not a I'm not cautiously optimistic personality wise I'm cautiously pessimistic and that all hard core cynical and pessimistic but I'm mildly both and I I think if the state is powerful enough we could have any of the weaker version of the final solution happen over the next year and the world kind of sit around and look at each other most of the time go on you know let's have some sanctions maybe I mean what should we do I bring that up because we're coming to a part in the story where it's let's call it a milestone or a potential Milestone on that time line that begins maybe you could say in the twentieth century keeps going to now concerning these kinds of events and I mean look at your newspaper today we still haven't figured out how to deal with this we just had some problems in the Middle East where everybody was going and how do we influence the humanitarian crisis we had it when the former Yugoslavia broke up you had a genocide in Rwanda going on and everybody looking at each other thinking to themselves what do we need to do here I mean while you know the killings are everyday and everybody sort of deliberating everybody's got to consider their own personal country strategic interest and no realpolitik questions at all understandable but it boils down to the same thing if this is 1943 and this is how we're behaving more Jewish people than Gypsies and homosexuals in Polish people and Priests are dying everyday and yet what's a responsible speed and what's a responsible level of force we can expect nation-states to employees situations like this so as we asked ourselves that question and realize that the people in the in the pre Second World War era had less in the way of tools and less in the way of structure and probably less in the way of Leverage I mean talking nuclear weapons now it's change the game completely and they're confronted with a similar sort of situation and by the way this is one we still deal with today and it is still controversial and that's why I brought up the point about denial or minimization or rationalization when it comes to questions of atrocities when last we spoke we were talking about the Battle of Shanghai a little-known battle by the way in the west but as participants like to point out by the time it's done and it went on like three months something like that you have his many dead on the Chinese side as either side kind of a little less I think but but at the Battle of Verdun in the first world war and historically nasty battle that went on longer the strategy of the battle of Shanghai was influenced by global public opinion or a desire to influence global public opinion in the Chinese wanted to prove that the Chinese to put up a fight against the Japanese and they wanted to send a message to the world that we're here we can resist if you want to help us it's a worthwhile investment and it's awful and you should help us there were photographs making it to the global media stories accounts from Western or Shanghai had quite a lot of westerners in it and so the Chinese through in all their best units stuff that they had stockpiled for a long time in other words they were going to shoot off all of their fireworks at once to make the biggest bang they could make and see if they could attract Global attention while they did so the upside of this is they did the downside of this is when it's gone it's gone I'm with the Japanese after several months of fighting launched an amphibious Invasion and open up another front on the city of Shanghai that's the story in terms of resistance in the Chinese resistance collapses they suffered a Brazilian casualties they're out of stuff and they stream back sort of routing and trying to get their act together towards the capitol At Nanking the Japanese are close on their heels and as they chase them and atrocity begins to occur now let me back up here because I was fascinated and yet I got pulled down the rabbit hole reading about the various points of you on what history calls some people called the Rape of Nanking other people called the name King incident the dancing atrocity and the reason there are all these different names is because it's very controversial in fact it's about as controversial as all those other genocides war crimes and atrocities that you will see on your list if you made a timeline as I said from the start of the twentieth century go to the people accused of the crime and asked to do admit it or ask him to talk about it you'll find a percentage always will but most people reflexively get defensive let's understand this is a human thing and let's understand just how widespread it is every now and then but regularly you will see a news story involving the Japanese education system and the story is always the same the Japanese textbooks specifically the history textbooks are not our whitewashing is the way someone with white washing downplaying covering up Japanese atrocities during its aggressive. In the second world war pre Second World War era often times these complaints will come from people who suffered at the hands of Japanese aggression China the Philippines the entire area around Malaysia I mean there's a bunch of places that were in the Japanese orbit for a time and those are often the people that get angry when Japanese atrocities are downplayed the people that are sometimes the most angry are the Americans who fought in that War veterans from Australia Canada Great Britain all these people want the Japanese to confront what they did but here's the way I want to portrayed in human terms we have similar textbook issues here in the United States and many other countries do to and they often revolve around history class for middle schoolers junior high schoolers and high schoolers the arguments are over how your own countries bad periods are portrayed and in the United States we often have these controversies because the nasty things that happened in the past are downplayed or sometimes exercised altogether and the more patriotic good things are played up now the Japanese will often come back with a similar sort of response are me to get political by both of the right-wing extra Patriot sides of both countries actually have similar views about what they want for trade in their textbooks they want their people portrayed positively creating a sense of citizenship pride in your heritage all that kind of stuff in appreciation for the things that make your people special and then I do find it so ironic that if you went to the people in my country they feel that way and ask them about Japanese textbooks they would definitely want the Japanese in most cases to have to confront your these sorts of things I wish this the real Patriots in the United States are pretty aware of of Japanese conduct in the second world war against our troops and others that they want that shown but if you then tried to put the shoe on the other foot and say okay in our own history books when we talkin about the Vietnam War how much full color photography and eyewitness account should we devote to something like the me Lai Massacre was you don't know about the me lie Massacre shame 1968 Vietnam War American soldiers went into a hamlet or Village and when they came out 302 550 villagers men women and children were dead rapes occurred I mean it was very very nasty very disillusioning for it I can speak experience from in the in the Ten Years afterwards As Americans confronted the fact that we were actually just like everyone else we were not this special Lone Ranger coming to save the world in a couple of world wars rebuild it afterwards with the Marshall Plan defended during the Cold War I mean we were all those things too but if you had said to American people in the 30s or 40s that Americans would do you a meal I type thing I think they would find it hard to believe I think with men in combat although you know I've only read it so take this with a grain of salt but I think what they would say is that in certain situations things can become very unpredictable and when there is a lack of strong leadership in those situations they can become deadly I'd like to draw a distinction between two kinds of atrocities hear you saw both kinds in the second world war by the way and trying to link the two of them not only Twisted some of the post-war war crimes trials into Knotts but affects us even today the difference between a top-down atrocity of the sort for example that Hitler and the Nazis were doing with the final solution the kind in the Syrian king would do for a Babylonian Final Solution a top-down order and if you're the guy on the ground you're killing people in executing people and committing an atrocity because you ordered two or the kind that happens of the sort for example that the ancient Romans / Latin historian tacitus says happened during a Roman Civil War the city called cremona this was a scandal so he wrote about it and he's almost a contemporary and the story basically goes it it's a story about troops when they get their bloodlust up and it reminds us that you know people can be venal to in large groups that can come out even in a more pronounced away and what made from Moana so terrible is it's a stacking of the city which is what the destruction of Babylon was and what the destruction of the city of Nanjing is going to be that would be named came back in the second world war it's a sacking of a city and tacitus says that these soldiers wanted to sack the city that they were worried that the city would surrender and if it surrendered to their Commander the Roman general will then he got the spoil so the Army tacitus says and he was a veteran by the way really wanted the city to not surrender so they could load it the city did surrender it was a Roman city by the way and the citizens in it where Roman the Roman army outside the city still wanted to loot the city so they did for several days the account is one of the really wicked accounts in the ancient world and it's funny though because if you took out the particulars it would probably work as a reasonable description of 10,000 sackings of cities in human history tacitus wrote about the destruction of cremona a Roman city by Roman soldiers after surrendering and he says quot 40000 armed men forced their way into the city neither rank nor years save the victims from an indiscriminate orgy in which rape alternated with murder and murder with rape greybeards and frail old women who had no value is loot were dragged off to raise a laugh but any full grown girl or good-looking lad who crossed their path was pulled this way and that in a violent tug of war between the would-be captors single loader trailing a horde of money or Temple offerings of massive gold was often cut to Pieces by others who were stronger and their hands they held firebrands which once they got their spoil away they wantonly flung into empty houses and rifle temples there was a diversity of wild desires different conceptions of what was lawful and nothing barred from Moana last of them for days and quote we would be mistaken thinking that this is something particularly Roman or particularly ancient there's something that goes on in certain situations and you can reliably see it again and again in December 1937 you see it in Nanking Nanchang though is so much harder to deal with than something like a trimona or the Iron Age destruction of Babylon because it's still a white cottage in Destin in terms of how passionate and upset and how visceral the argument over it can get people get death threats regularly for the books I bought for this subject and by the way we post all of the research materials in the show notes on the website for the show's encourage you to buy these books by the way if you like this stuff some of the Nanking stuff is positively Kennedy assassination asked in terms of the minutiae and detail a big points can often revolve around small little things and I think Magic Bullet why do people love that stuff in and reading it a one of them great book The Nanking atrocity 1937-38 complicating the picture has different Scholars writing each chapter from a wide range of people and one of the things that the Japanese editor of the book set in the introduction is that several of the contributors that had their lives threatened some of them face-to-face for their writings research teachings and lectures on this stuff don't have a whole lot of people threatening to bash your head in because of your views on cremona do you I'll give you an example of a problem that a history fan faces trying to talk about this if you wanted to make a graph of the range of opinions on what the death toll is in Nanking in December and on word for months on one side of the spectrum you have the Japanese people who fall into the class that are known as The deniers Who consider everything we're going to talk about you to be an illusion caused by a combination of contemporary wartime propaganda and a lot of marxist stop especially by leftist Japanese marks his teachers were polluting the minds of their own children I mean it's a super Patriot Point of View with a tinge of conspiracy that would probably resonate in a bunch of different countries with the same group of people they're probably all countries actually we said in the earlier conversation that like the Jewish folks that this phrase was originally applied to the Japanese are really intense there like everybody else only more so or just like anybody else only more so and I think you see it in the passions here to when people get so upset about you know besmirching the reputation of the Imperial Japanese Army and the country I get angry as Patriots will do especially if they don't think it's deserved and the people on one side of the spectrum here will claim that maybe 45 people died in this Nanking thing in those may have been Justified one way or another now on the far opposite end of the scale in the Spectrum you have Chinese historians in the Chinese official government line they've actually carved a number their number into a rock I saw a picture of it it's a little like you know proverbially carving it into stone I guess that is what they're doing and the attempts to create it's pretty clear a number that has the same sort of intellectual resonance with the global population that the Six Million number has for the Holocaust everybody knows 6 billion okay where'd you come up with that number 5 minutes 7 million what you come up with a nice round number and eventually people go yellow Holocaust I took too many people died there the Chinese are trying to do this with the Nanking atrocity and the number that they settled on is 300,000 dead 300,000 dead and there are Chinese historians and let's acknowledge your maybe not operating with complete freedom in terms of being able to follow the historical evidence wherever it takes them but they're in Chinese history as it will bump that number up considerably the 350,000 range is not unheard of the ball if you want to go to Crazy Town and then find the very end of the spectrum what's the largest number you've ever seen my fiance in large 500,000 I saw a half-million wants not credible but that's what I saw 45 not credible either on the other end but now on that scale are a bunch of different gradients of peoples and their views on this subject that's why it's really difficult to talk about because it's not just an it didn't happen yes it did thing it's Willshire it did but it only happened here or yes it did but it only happened at these people it's just the lawyer Lee breakdown over the geographical boundaries where someone who dies in this quadrant counts as a Nanking atrocity casualty as someone who dies outside that quadrant doesn't I mean silly like that the Chinese historians point out and supposedly this is why China didn't make a huge deal specifically over the Nanking situation in the first few decades after the war was because this was more par for the course then not and part of the way you get some of these really large number accounts is the Chinese historian sometimes include the soldiers from the Battle of Shanghai who died in part because the Japanese troops who took their surrender or who captured them or who found them wounded on the battlefield executed them there this is another part of the gradient in the discussion right who do you count if you're talkin about soldiers do they count in the atrocity will what if you killed them after they surrendered as I said a bunch of different people have different opinions along the Spectrum now if you're looking for a mid-range to try to get sort of a little ballast on this question a lot of the mainstream mainstream historians will range for like a hundred thousand dead to 250,000 dead and that is a huge number no matter which it is the other question that always comes up in a case like this in this is connected to the Nazi situation in Europe but is who's responsible where does the responsibility lie because you will often hear these situations and sometimes it's valid compared to the sacking of cremona where you have troops your loss of institutional control maybe on the part of the leaders or callous disregard for the plight of people you know that your lower level troops were despoiling whatever it might be you hear that some people make the case that all of this is premeditated might as well have been naughty stuff and once again we could divide it into separating soldiers from civilians but there's an interesting little bridge between the two and that's soldiers who dress up as civilians now before we get into this story you're entitled to know how I come to my thinking and if anything might on bias to me my normal approach is to put myself in other people's viewpoints to try to see their perspective but trying to see the perspective of the side that thinks there's 45 or a hundred or two hundred deaths here in their explain away a bullet feels like trying to be a defender of a holocaust denier it's a really difficult position for me to put myself in a I think you should point it out and I had to have a very hard time putting myself even if you were in debating classmates that you have to take this perspective and defend it I am usually open-minded enough to keep a lot of Doubt open though depending on the other circumstances involved for example if this was a very unusual incident in the second sino-japanese war or the second World War I think I'd be inclined to say listen wartime propaganda mean those people might have a point the problem is is that the Japanese Army and Navy to agree with the Army certainly is a repeat offender in this war of the sino-japanese one and the second world war that but by the way by 1937 lot of people think the second world war has started so it depends a lot of people when I was a kid I always started it with the invasion of Poland but since then there's a lot of opinion has shifted and so you know really 1937 this the Japanese are in World War II the other powers just aren't in yet themselves to Chinese the Japanese are starting the second world war and in this case the Japanese will behave for the Chinese atrociously and you have to really write off a ton of evidence including your own soldiers and commanders Diaries if you want to explain it away you also have to deal with the remembrances of combat veterans from pretty much every Power that fought the Japanese in the second world war where atrocious behavior and a certain brutal level of conduct was always remark upon and that's after you factor out racism and hatred of the enemy who killed your body is all that other stuff I mean there's a ton of evidence and the questions over why what's going on here have been ongoing and they sort of in a smaller way parallel the ones going on after the second world war with the Nazis where you had things like the Milgram experiment all these other things or people were trying to figure out how do you get people to turn off their moral compass can we all be Nazis it was trying to figure out motivation and how you do that I mean in the second world war and afterwards and let's remember the Japanese public knew very little of this stuff although some of the stuff that they did know and sort of celebrate is once again a little weird Western standards for example there's a famous incident Nanking War II soldiers were having supposedly this is in the Japanese news media contest a Chinese head shop in contest and the tally was being kept score regularly in the newspaper you know this this guy is up to 75 now he takes the lead and it was always used as evidence of you know you're looking for a sign that this brutality happened will my goodness they were celebrating in Japan's newspapers turns out most Mains mainstream excuse me but you know what I mean historians and I've been reading suggests that that never happened and that it was a figment of the presses desire to whip up an interesting story that got people reading what you did it does a course beg the question about an audience who thought that that was worth celebrating but there have been speculations forever and the the early ones during the war we're always in a racist in culture with this is just how the Japanese are since then there's been a lot of interesting ones including ones from Japan and just to give you an idea one of them will talk about the brutality in the Japanese Army we're apparently being punched in the face hard with a closed fist by your Superior was not uncommon and there's plenty of reports about people having to commit executions for the the killing of pows as part of a sort of blood in you is very old-fashioned idea once again a lot of the things the Japanese were going to be in trouble for in the second world war are things that people didn't even bat an eyelash 500 years ago about in fact ever happened outside of a very close geographical area that's another thing that's different about Nanking there's telegraph's there there's embassies there's westerners there is us and British boats chips in the Yangtze River the real world outside this area is going to hear about what's happening inside Nanking and they're going to hear about it while it's going on it's a Thoroughly Modern situation that we have seen over and over again since we're there will be some terrible atrocity crisis humanitarian disaster genocide War crime going on somewhere in the world and unfolding in real time and all the great powers are kind of under the gun at that point when everybody says my goodness something has to be done or more people will die but the world global geopolitical power is rarely react at speed on these kind of things but it's been a little bit of an unsolvable problem you see it in Nanking for sure because what's going to happen there will unfold over a. Of weeks the world will be put into a moral quandary over what to do so picking up the story after the battle of Shanghai the Chinese forces Retreat toward the capital of Shanghai and during the retreat the Japanese lead elements are trying to surround the Chinese so this is a a flight with the Japanese in Hot Pursuit there are also civilians along the path there are aircraft strafing and bombing the roads you get this sense of chaos and Bedlam and claustrophobia and panic and you know I've seen you seen war footage since that time that you really get a sense and a camera gives you a very good sense of a combination of things that must have been working on these people to the fluidity of the situation right everything is moving quickly and you're in the middle of it and also a complete lack of knowledge about what's going on outside your field of vision or whatever the person next to you can say the combination of those two things is panic inducing so imagine the sort of a Bedlam as these is this line of humanity pursued by the Japanese runs toward Nanking the Japanese arrived close on their heels and mostly surround the city and on December 9th they're outside this walled city of Nanking it looks like a sort of a European medieval city demanding its surrender there is a Chinese General in command of a hastily thrown together but relatively you know it's China large number of soldiers are some of them green some of them old and reservists some of them from the battle that just was over in Shanghai and they're not fair they don't have their weapons there may be defeatist I mean it's a it's a it's a bit of a Motley Crew but they're going to defend the city so for 4 days they hold out before that general orders a retreat he leaves the government leaves and you have now a city with hundreds of thousands of people including refugees that's being bombed and no governmental services or anyone in charge the Japanese have yet to take over and it's one of the great stories by the way of this City's plight and that's that there were a group of westerners in the city most most of the westerners ran away as soon as the Japanese Army came but a bunch of different people businessmen and others humanitarias doctors stayed and they weren't there to take care of all these people but when that fell into their lap they stepped up to do it there's a little ironic twist to the story too and they recently made a movie out of basically I almost playing on that twists and it's that the guy that was sort of elected by this ad hoc group to be the leader was a Nazi and Argent Nazi is the sources described him a businessman John rabe and part of the reason he gets the gig is because the Japanese government and the Nazi Germany government have been moving closer together and maybe he has a little bit more pull with the Japanese they're just about to take over the city then maybe a British or American or I give her the Danish guy maybe they don't have as much pull so this guy gets the gig and the movie I saw the tagline you know of the of the preview and I think it said something like it if he saved 250,000 lives and you see scenes of him with huddle Chinese refugees and he hides them from aircraft under a giant swastika flag so they're sort of that that playing with the idea to hear you have the evil Nazis and yet there's a good person mixed in with a juxtaposition that you can hang whole movie Eamon I don't know about 250,000 lives in terms of the number I do know that this is twenty or Thirty people there's women in the group doctors ministers businessmen and they save a ton of people and it's in large part because of the documents that they sent or the information that they kept track of that we have a lot of these accounts and when I wanted to spend 3 hours on it I was going to go through all of the letters let me encourage you to get another book if you're interested in this and it's one of the few I've ever read that should be dry as a bone but it's actually in its own way terrifying because it's it's chronological primary source document so the cables and the telegrams and the letters and the please from these people John Rabe and all these people who make up the Nanking International safety zone folks as it's called and you can read everyday these letters get more beseeching more terrified more outraged as the situation descends into monsters chaos on December 13th to Japanese enter Nanking there's a letter from John Rabe saying thank you so much for not selling our little International safety zone that we've created which by the way is nothing more than a part of the city blocked off and on the sides of the streets where the border is they put international Flags I think it was December 1st at the Nanking mayor before fleeing the city tells all the civilians to run into the safety zone cuz they'll be safe there which allows the Japanese to then say that anybody who's not in the safety zone is ipso-facto a bad guy and what begins to happen right away is the Japanese start searching for Chinese soldiers because there was as we said a lot of them there another part of the atrocity here is if you are a Defender basically of the Japanese Army in this case do you count the killing of Chinese soldiers as a war crime in officially there's no question but that allows some people to divert you and say what we admit that these people who died Were Soldiers but I deny the civilian side of this in this case what happens is there's a river with the Yangtze that runs behind Nanking if you look at it it's it it in order for Chinese troops to get out of Nanking and get away from The Uncommon Japanese they would have to cross the river so to go over to the more Chinese side and keep going normally not a problem but of course you know they were trying to create a defensive Zone 2 for the Japanese have been blowing up the bridges and everything that would allow the Chinese to get away too and now they have to so there are these heroin stories of Chinese troops just at the riverbank waiting a thousands and thousands of people waiting for one little boat that can carry three people look like a canoe across the river and the Japanese are on the way and if there's one group of people that know the Japanese are not taking Chinese prisoners its Chinese soldiers so this sense of panic is palpable and let me turn to some of the sources and I have a wide mix of them and my apologies I said I'd like to do 3 hours and I'd like to just read the documents to you because there are several there like police blotter reports were there trying to tell the Japanese Commander at this hour this woman was raped over here and the Japanese soldiers Builder sugar I mean it's literally like police reports but it's it's all I can think of when I was reading it is how unusual it was to have something like this and if you could have had a similar document it would apply equally well to the sack of Carthage by the Romans you know what ancient times I mean this is a modern-day account of something you just don't get a whole lot of but that's happened a lot of times in history seems woefully out of place in time though here's the way would you are Acura contributor to the Nanking atrocity complicating the picture said that the attack on Nanking was out of control from the start with all sorts of units that were Glory hungry and wanted to be the first inside the city and there's a sense of out-of-control troops such as the Battle of cremona would that psychology going on so here we get another gradient in the responsibility spectrum that we've been talking about do you blame Japan for what's about to happen here no it was a bunch of out-of-control troops and in some ways it was Akira writes about the Japanese units finding out on December 13th that the Chinese were retreating and leaving and trying to get away he writes quote Japanese units learned of this Retreat on the morning of the thirteenth skirmishes broke out in many areas of small groups of Chinese troops outside the city now lacking a chain of command desperately try to slip past advancing Japanese forces than the surrendering began most of the Chinese troops still inside Nanking rushed to escape Helter Skelter through the pot chain gate which led to the shock Juan Wharf area from shock when they hope to cross the Yangtze by boat by raft or by clinging desperately to scraps of lumber for they madly ran up and down the river bank only to encounter Japanese forces center cut them off huge numbers of Chinese troops became prisoners of War on the 13th and 14th at Shaquan move of Sean Chang Chun gate and the Shelf hog 8 with no Avenue of the sky Chinese soldiers lost all will to fight despite trying to surrender in droves most were killed in the Palmetto of battle and quote Ethan quotes from the Diaries from December 13th 1937 of to Japanese commanders 16th division commander and 30th Brigade Commander these are primary source documents and 16th division Commander Nakajima Casados diary rights quote we see prisoners everywhere so many that there's no way we can deal with them the general policy is except no prisoners so we ended up having to take care of them lot Stock and Barrel but they changing hordes and units of thousands or five thousand so we couldn't even disarm them later I heard that the Sasaki unit alone dispose of about 1,500 a company Commander guarding typing gate took care of another 1300 another 7000 8000 clustered machine hogate are still surrendering we need a really huge ditch to handle those seven thousand eight thousand but we can't find one so someone suggested this plan now quote someone else's plan divide them up into groups of a hundred to two hundred and then lured them to some suitable spot for finishing off and quote 30th Brigade Commander major-general Sasaki to Avicii wrote in his diary on the 13th of December quote the number of abandoned enemy bodies in our area today was 10000 plus thousands more if we include those Chinese who's escaped wraps for boats on the Yangtze were sunk by fire from our Armored Cars Plus pows killed by our units are Detachment alone must have taken care of over 20,000 we finished the mop up and secured our rear area in about 2 p.m. while regrouping we advance to the hoping date later the enemy surrendered in the thousands frenzied troops rebuffing efforts by superiors to restrain them finished off those pows one after another even if they aren't soldiers for example Medics are priests men would yell kill the whole damn lot after recalling the past ten days of bloody fighting image so many buddies that shed so much blood and quote it's right there you see another one of those lines but some people take which is the superior tried to restrain them but their buddies were killed and they were understandably upset enough to commit atrocities there's also a ton of evidence that there was a take-no-prisoners policy historian Herbert P Bix in his book on Hirohito is Pulitzer prize-winning book on Hirohito rights this quote there were no orders to rape in quotes Nanking Nordeen Imperial headquarters ever order the total extermination of the enemy as the ultimate goal of the Nanking encirclement campaign standing orders to take no prisoners did exist however and once named King fell Japanese soldiers began to execute and Max military prisoners of war and unarmed deserters who had surrendered they also went on an unprecedented an unplanned Rampage of arson tillage murder and rape the resulting Slaughter continued in the city six of Jason rural Villages for 3 months and far exceeded earlier atrocities committed during the Battle of Shanghai and along the Escape Routes to Nanking General Nakajima 16th division in just its first day in the capital killed approximately 30000 Chinese prisoners of war in fleeing soldiers and quote there are charges that these orders to kill all prisoners come from the highest up on the scene which by the 13th I believe is the Emperor hirohito's uncle there will be an execution or two after the war for what goes on in this city but trying to figure out who's responsible for it has been an ongoing part of the debate how high up the food chain do you blame this what it really seems to be is this combination of two things a ordered War crime from the Western perspective the killing of surrendering or captured pows cuz after all you go look at the Soviet Union and the number of prisoners that fell into German hands after the June 1941 Invasion there and you'll never have these giant castle schlacht these cauldron battles and they capture 250,000 people at a time and you are these photographs of huge crowds of people are long column stretching off into the distance kicking up tons of dust and then trying to figure out how do we how do we barbwire these people in a pan and keep them and then how do we feed him didn't see any of that in this part of the war between China and Japan cuz they're not taking prisoners and nobody knows that better than the Chinese troops so this sense of panic that's going on in the city I was trying to think of an analogy it's a little like you're getting a hundred thousand or more people in the soccer stadium and then having somebody tell you over the public-address speaker that the doors out have been barred and armed gunmen are coming in to kill all hundred or hundred and fifty thousand people in the stadium what is the mood like then well if it's panic-stricken that would be understandable and this is when incidents begin happening in the story that become so the hinge moment we were talking about communicable diseases or an epidemic this is when it jumps species from merely affecting the soldiers and now affecting the civilians because in their panic and quite understandably so a lot of these Chinese troops and undetermined number these Chinese troops are going to throw off their uniforms and throw their weapons away and dressing any civilian clothing they can find they may be added in this by the population because after all this is a Chinese City and these are Chinese troops but the Japanese start looking for Chinese troops that are thrown away their uniforms in a dressed as civilians and they start taking people out of crowds many of whom are civilians and executing them and then you have the part of the story that just takes this too unbelievable crazy levels which is what starts to happen to the civilians and this is where it looks like from Moana because you have and it starts if you read the primary source material it starts on the 13th and you start to get these these requests can you please put more military police officers out on the streets because the soldiers are out of control the main thing they're out of control with although there's a lot of looting is rape and it's crazy to read as I said I want to do 3 hours on this and just go go from one police blotter account to another because it gives you a real-time it away sense of what's going on all over the Nanking International safety zone where they were getting more than a thousand reports of rape tonight and is one of the humanitarians working there said the Japanese have turned the international safety zone into a public house meaning of whorehouse and they were often killing the women that they rape it's it's worth giving an account from the victim's hear the Chinese side and in one of the books that I have Nanking in 1937 memory and healing they have a Chinese story who's giving what is I guess it's the recognize Chinese view of this thing and he pulls no punches he wants you to know how nasty a God and a person who says they were only 45 people who died in this whole incident with call the Chinese a liar or their government a bunch of people just wanting to the hold this over Japan's head but here's the Chinese history sunshine away just happened in Nanking quote in general the massacre itself can be divided into two types of killings mass killings and sporadic killing incidence of mass killing range from the murder of 10 to 20 to the slaughter of tens of thousands of people with the greatest number in anyone into the reaching more than 50,000 sporadic killing included varying numbers of 328 people among the mass killings in addition to those who died by the sword and firing squad others were burned buried alive or drowned several after being soaked with gasoline we're set on fire by gunshot causing the wounded person to lie covered in Flames rolling and riding on the ground until finally dying a miserable death individual sporadic acts of torture and killing included splitting gutting slicing piercing alive and dog biting somewhere even burned with acid and then left burning all over others were tortured to death to Japanese lieutenants amuse themselves by having a killing contest the first one to reach a hundred killed one the game then they raise the limit to 150 in addition to killing he writes the Nanking massacre also involved rape arson theft and other violent crimes the Japanese troops to attack Nanking rape tens of thousands of Chinese women many of them were then murdered and quote anytime I find myself thinking that those numbers that the Chinese historians give are way too large I recalled that according to tacitus the Roman legionaries completely picked cremona clean in 4 days Nanking is going to continue 4 months how much evil can you do in a time frame like that admittedly they're not ripping Nanking apart with quite the efficiency or rapacity is the Romans were ripping cremona apart but if you got months to do it I imagine it's going to be pretty thorough now if you say that we have spent too much time focusing on a single atrocity when we're talking about a conflict this going to go on to 1945 I would agree with you except that we're not going to spend a lot of time necessarily on all the atrocities between now and the end of the war that deserve attention what's more you look at the raw death totals that the Chinese are going to between 1937 and 1945 alone and if you include the indirect causes of death because of the war things like fan in the disease your numbers get to the 15 and 20 million people levels you want to go just with directly caused by violence it gets down to maybe 12 million in 12 oz of which by the way our civilian where are their stories most of those people die individually or suffering anonymity were killed in small out-of-the-way villages or Hamlet who speaks for them let's let the relatively and comparatively well attested to situation in Nanking allegations if you were denier but still well attested to allegations in the worst-case scenario let's let those speak for all those other people who stories didn't make it into the history books the second reason to focus perhaps inordinately on the atrocity like Nanking is that it's one of a bunch of pre-war atrocities and these will continue by the way during the conflict as well that seen to set up your this era where you have these brutal totalitarian armies at least the way the Western liberal democracies look at these things that seem to be on the March and they seem to be the bad guys in the story the bad guys is an interesting thing to ponder because in most wars especially all the recent ones where you can get into the newspaper accounts and stuff like that pretty common to portray one's adversary in almost apocalyptically evil terms in the first world war the Germans were called the Huns because Hans were about the nastiest thing British propaganda and others could think of in terms of slapping a label on them and they helped out all they could on the German side by doing things that have been named the rape of Belgium and stuff at the time shocking the genteel nineteenth-century sensibilities of the age let the record show how exponential that can grow in a near generation because the outrage over the rape of Belgium involved about 6,000 people killed directly maybe those the modern numbers and we've already talked about what the numbers are in China it's worth pointing out that if you take standard numbers for both world wars and compare them look at the difference in the ratio of Civilian to military casualties in the first world war standard number you get for soldiers killed about 10 million people about 7 million civilians in that warts estimated in the second world war more like 20 to 25 million military deaths and more like 35 to 60 million civilian deaths several times were civilian deaths in the second world war last civilian deaths in the first and that's the part that by the standards of most war crimes or just individual perception makes the second world war so much more atrocious a lot of people are willing to forgive all sorts of nastiness if it's done to soldiers women children old people the infirmed the sick the noncombatants it's much more harrowing and shocking when they're killed and here's the problem with the good and evil narrative do you think that the Japanese textbooks are teaching their kids that they were on the evil side of this war the way the Western Democratic textbooks tend to frame the Japanese side of this obviously the Germans are sore on but the Japanese are one of the powers that work with sore on the rim the Easter there is one of those people one of the reasons the countries like China have problems with Japan's textbook is in their minds they're not confronting this fact that wait a minute let me know that you were the evil side of this war good and evil is a strange thing though is that I had to think about this for a while because who says a particular behavior is evil you go talk to jangus Khan about Good and Evil in the 13th century from the Mongol point of view and he may have I'm going to guess he has a different interpretation of what constitutes one of the other right this is a perception thing if the Nazis had somehow won the war and we were all having our concepts of Good and Evil framed under that regime how different do on duct for example that the Fairmont Carryout on Hitler's orders in the East after they invaded the Soviet Union and it was this you know No Holds Barred all laws thrown out the window kind of conflict a different does that look you think the Germans were the Nazis cuz it might be a pan Nordic sort of Empire do you think they frame that and good and evil terms and if they do you think they're framing their side is evil the perception thing is hard to get past isn't it because from the perspective of someone who grew up in what the post-war history books always called the Great liberal democracies the Western democracies you have concentration camps that are being used as genocide Factory assembly lines you pretty much by our value system steak out where you are on the good evil side of the Divide pretty clearly the Japanese had something that reminds you of some of the Nazi Medical Science put that in parentheses or quotes on their Unit 731 it was called in Manchuria in northern China that conducted experiments on humans and vivisections and you know infected fleas with Bubonic plague and then dropped them by are over Chinese cities recorded the data evil stuff like that from our Western liberal Enlightenment era based value system that's unrepentantly evil now if you take yourself out of those shoes though I went and read the arguments as anyone should that the people who defend other points of view on this make usually if they don't just deny the information out right is the deniers of the Nanking atrocity or of the Holocaust do they will say yes but yes we did these things and people are terrible but you did Terrible Things to things that are often not admitted to or accepted by the liberal Democratic post-enlightenment side of this thing for example strategic bombing you talk to people in Japan or in Germany who lived the reality of their cities being bombed by sometimes hundreds of aircraft I sometimes multiple times sometimes with atomic bomb and they have an interesting perspective on it I'll never forget one of them saying to me if the same results had been achieved the old-fashioned way you'd come in here and done with bayonets the functional equivalent of what you did with bombs from a distance how does it look then hard to get over the idea it looks a little like Nanking doesn't it here's the thing you go to someone on the British and the thing is though that were on the receiving end of the Blitz the luftwaffe is bombing of London and Britain instead of saying yes that's how we fell to You'll often hear them say you know tough you started it what you got back was reaping what you sow. That's an interesting argument and kind of understandable in human terms here's the problem there's always been an implication that the people that are being bombed somehow deserve it and I always try to remind myself if my country ever got into a war with someone else and I got bombed by them would I somehow think I deserved it because of the role I played in supporting my country's policies or supporting my country or would I think that I was just a person caught in the gears of history that I had little control over what really happened and that there's really no good excuse for these bomb to fall on me the other argument you will sometimes get sometimes from other Asian people sometimes other Asian people who were also victims of the Japanese is they will bring in the question of colonialism and they will say something like sure the Western democracies were on their good behavior and did relatively well in terms of controlling the troops are behaving well militarily speaking during this conflict but look at the situation after the conflict and more importantly look at the situation beforehand with centuries of colonialism add up all that stuff and all those evils and put them on the balance scale to sure the Japanese were terrible but let's not pretend that we're only talking about the second world war here when we're adding up who's been terrible to home when this is about walking a mile in the other person's moccasins and it's important to consider those points it is worth pointing out and many here in the Westwood that the terrible things done as part of the effort to win the second world war comes after these sorts of incidents that we're discussing here and maybe are necessary because of the kind of incidents were talking about here that's why we spend so much time on this Nanking atrocity because it's hardly the only thing going on this would be an appropriate time to zoom out of the story here keep one part of your peripheral vision always on China though because the Japanese biggest fear of getting bogged down in an endless war in China is going to come true we compared it to an addiction earlier they're fully addicted they don't know how to get out and the more they conquer the war their troubles are when the atomic bombs are dropped at the end of the War II Japanese are still bogged down in China I have this weird upside down backwards Mirror Image fun the house sort of view of the Strategic situation facing the Japanese in China it's like this weird turn around the United States strategic dilemma in the Vietnam War there you had this giant Continental power the US bog down and unable to extricate itself with any sort of Peace terms they can live with in a place what would you say roughly just be vaguely the size of something like California the Japanese in the Chinese version of this they're more like the size of California and they're bogged down in the Guerrilla war and not always a gorilla war in a continental landmass the size of the US the first thing I'm thinking about if I'm in the Japanese leadership is I don't want any more trouble with anyone else I'm busy and the Japanese will continue to conquer city after city after City they will control the railway lines that connect the city's the roads that connect the cities and the Chinese can just keep moving their Capital as far away as they need to go to be out of the Japanese in a range of the bombs although they do fall fall on the Chinese capital from time to time and the countryside is infested with nationalist Army his communist armies gorillas and surgeons warlord troops Bandits and there will be hundreds of thousands usually close to a million Japanese troops some of their best forces to all requiring supplies all the time in this theater for the entire War it was we said we have to zoom out at this point in the story because events elsewhere in the world are going to have more of an effect on what happens in this part of the world than anything that's happening in this part of the world I mean for example as as the Europeans began to slide toward the second world war the Japanese are watching and is that war breaks out and gets underway they're paying attention to the results and reacting accordingly in other words like many Powers they're trying to read the lay of the land and is the second world war will break out the lay of the land going to change quickly tough to know which horse to bet on when things are so fluid the 1930s as we should point out and it is important to understand the context is a pretty crappy decade for most countries it is in the great depths of the Great Depression and it is hard to exaggerate what that means of me people think of economic hard times but it opens the door to all sorts of political instability and problems on every front and some people like Franklin Roosevelt in the United States and leaders everywhere had their hands full trying to pull out of this economic nosedive nobody was prepared to spend a lot of money or lot of political capital or ask the country to give some great sacrifice for some calls around the world when you hardly could handle the problems that going to put people in soup lines in your in the streets of your major cities 1938 is the key year were things really spiral out of control although it's not always apparent that that's what's happening many people have suggested that it would have been very easy to imagine the second world war breaking out in 1938 things happening you have the Angeles where Germany annexes Austria you have the huge situation over Czechoslovakia and the sudetenland and all that stuff you have the peace in our time Munich agreement and I should point out something because it's and I'll try not to get on my soapbox here but it drives me crazy the Munich agreement of course is where the prime minister of Britain who had gone to a conference with hair Hitler comes back gets off a plane I've seen this unit you can go see it in the museums in waves this document with his signature and Hitler signature on it and declares basically that this is peace in our time and people applaud Chamberlain is a reviled figure to most people today he seen as a week appeaser that should have confronted Hitler me this isn't a million things we throw it all these people these these weak need pre second world war political leaders totally forgetting to Major things in about a thousand minor things let's go into the two major things the first one of these people have already live for the worst war that they can ever imagine 20 years ago before the first world war and nobody really knew what they were getting into a 1930s everybody knows what they're getting naked in the first world war only worse again and too many of these people they thought they saw their civilization nearly knocked out in that war if you're going to have another one and it's going to be worse and you're starting it from the Great Depression levels of economic health what's the likelihood you're going to survive this time what's the proper price to pay to avoid that outcome now what about the public support for any policy like that this is the other thing that is widely forgotten in a place like United States especially people who we logged for being ahead of the power curve on this guy's like Winston Churchill who for see all this sort of a screaming for confrontation and and and more Amor Bella Coast policy to ward off all this stuff that is not right we'll avoid this war for tougher now the die is like in the political Wilderness in this. And these derided by many is a warmonger so he sort of out of steps with the attitude of the time as we all know this war is going to break out in 1939 a month after it breaks out a month after it breaks out there's a public opinion poll of Americans on the issue of the war I'll hit you quoted by Francis Pike in Hirohito swear I think it's a Gallup poll but I'm not sure the poll taken had 84% of respondents saying that they wanted Britain and France to win the war only 2% one of the Germans to win but 95% 95% of the stay out of the war first of all this is more reflective of the America of that time. Much less intervention is to run its entire history than now but when you think of those kind of overwhelming numbers in a system where the political leaders are elected what is it responsible to expect them to do how many people are going to go against that kind of supermajority what's more in a philosophical sense in a system where the people are supposed to sort of broadly decide the course of the nation if 95% of them wants to take a left turn at the fork in the road where is the moral Justice in the political leaders making a right instead so I think we judge these people harshly and assume you know that they had more ability to do what we want them to do than they did and of course let's remember the most important part whenever you do something like the Monday Morning Quarterback in history we know how things turn out they don't mother having been said famously the Munich agreement falls through Poland is invaded September 1st 1939 bold and it made given a guarantee by Britain and France because they finally had enough of Hitler's I don't want any more territory don't worry and when the Nazis refused to leave Poland after its demanded of them the war is on in Europe and the Japanese are watching now as we know Poland is over run quickly the post-war propaganda calls it Blitzkrieg what it really looks like is just the first world war tactics and strategy and philosophy developed over 20 years then there's this. That sometimes called the phoney War where nothing much is going on and then in April 1940 Germany invades Denmark and Norway and conquers them pretty quickly and then a month later not even a month later I don't think I'm a 1940 bunch of things happen not necessarily in this order Winston Churchill becomes prime minister of Britain so now we have one of the major players in this story ensconced in power a decision-maker famously Pitbull like in his bellicosity and yet at the same time seemingly the right man for the job because I mean if if Churchill was a bit of a M&M antagonist in that and a fighter that was a little bit embarrassing in more peaceful times he's exactly what you need now that the war's going isn't he May is also the month where the phony war ends on the Western Front the German blow through a couple of neutral countries and then into France now we should point out another reality during the time. That's often forgotten Now France is widely considered to be the strongest land power in the world at this time. Many International calculations are based on this assumption this is something will prove to be false quickly France will be defeated in a mere six weeks to put that in perspective in the understand how incredibly shocking that is for this time. You're talking about a country here that only 20 years previously had spent more than a million of their soldiers lives holding off arguably the greatest army of the age the first world war German Army for more than 4 years and remember not only has France defeated here but the Dutch are defeated as part of the Germans blowing through this area and the British look like they're 5 minutes away from succumbing as well if you're making calculations based on world events in Japan all of a sudden all of these valuable areas in your neck of the woods that are controlled by the Dutch and the French and the British don't seem so formidably defended anymore remember if your Japan you might not even be looking at those places if you could just hold on to China and Conquer it and use its resources that's all they need really meant wouldn't give you everything you wanted but when is Japan's looking to be a great power and they think they have to suck up China to do it everything in their policy is based on being able to maintain that addiction they only start looking towards some of these other tempting areas like French Indochina modern-day Vietnam Laos and Cambodia because some of the more obvious Avenues toward supplying your War Machine are being squeezed by other powers if you go look at the economic side of the second world war which is a very popular way to look at it lately and I find it very valuable in terms of understand some of the deeper motivation all of the Axis powers were concerned with self-sufficiency autarky is what it's called and this is actually playing into the global trade situation involves economics in a way that kind of explains War motivation very well but the reason that countries like Germany for example one and self-sufficiency was in part because they have been starved to death in the first world war when they're shipping and trade was cut off by the British Navy these countries wanted the flex ability to be relatively immune to other countries economic pressure the Japanese wanted to do what they wanted to do in China and wanted to be able to flip the middle finger to countries that told them to stop unfortunately in this time. They depended on other countries too much destroying James L McClain rights in a modern history of Japan quote to the regret a mini Japanese economic planners in the late 1930s Japan still depended upon the United States for nearly one-third of its imports from cotton to scrap iron and oil and matter seem to be growing worse between 1929 and 1932 Japan purchased from the United States 36% of its scrap iron used to manufacture steel for Munitions and ships by 1938 American sources were supplying 74% of Japan's scrap similarly in 1938 Japan received more than 60% of its imported machine tools and nearly all sophisticated Alloys such as Vanadium and molybdenum from the United States traditionally self-sufficient in Copper Japan in 1939 extracted 90,000 tons of that metal from its mines but industry was gobbling up so much for detonators and shell casings that the nation that your head to import a hundred and five thousand tons of copper 93% of it from the United States the situation oil the most critical of all Commodities in the estimation of military planners was extremely desperate Japan relied on America for almost 80% of its Fuel and for special distillates dependent student more than 90% in the eyes of Economic and military strategists by the summer of 1940 Western colonies in Southeast Asia had come to represent a treasure Trove of raw materials whose possession would allow Japan to Vault into the ranks of the economic halves to recall one of their prime minister's phrases and dust to free itself from dependence upon an increasingly hostile West and quote you can see why a concept like National self-sufficiency might be attractive to someone like the Japanese who are dependent on these outside powers to sell them what they need especially what they need to keep the war machine running so what happens if the people who sell you the stuff you need to keep the war machine running stop selling you the stuff you need and that becomes kind of the Crux of this story I know many of you are as fascinated As I Am by how Wars get started and there is no template mean they're all different of the variables in the same but you can see you know similar patterns in this particular case you see the pattern of a sort of inertia developing you saw this in the first World War II I believe I described it like someone pulling the pin out of a hand grenade but you could also think about it like a fuse being lit it's when events start to move towards collision and at a certain point it almost becomes easier to run into each other and have a conflict than to break out of the pattern and in this case it's going to be a question of feeding the Japanese war machine the gifts this Dynamic going and I was trying to get into all the tit-for-tat things and it got very complicated because there's so many players and as we said earlier and it's important to remember that in the Japanese government just like the Western democracies there is no hive mind at work there are lots of different ideas over what the best foreign policy directions are to go and different factions favoring different things and based on events some factions are exalted and others are in Decline so there is no concerted foreign policy effort that is without fits and starts and a certain level of chaos been in the case of the Japanese and we talked about this earlier in the story their governmental design is already not wonderful in terms of accountability and the lines of command and all these things when we start getting to a a moment where the stress level and the need for efficiency and clear thinking and clear lines of authority become really important this government's going to break down in such a way that if you are a Japanese citizen I that you have every right to accuse them of some kind of criminal negligence because look what the Japanese are you know right around the time France Falls where they have a major war and commitment going on in China there already rationing luxury goods and fuel at home that people are already grumbling and then what 18 months later when you add to that burden a war against the United States Great Britain and France all their former Colonial dominions and Commonwealth Nations mean how the hell does that happen well in a broad sense it happens because of a decision to stop the Japanese War Machine if you look at it objectively that becomes the issue where there's no given this is very controversial because everybody's argue forever what the cause of the Pacific me toward but if you look at it if it if it comes pretty simple that the Japanese priorities and the Americans and British the anglo-americans maybe we can call them priorities clash and the priorities have to do with what it is the Japanese are addicted to China the whole reason I like the addiction and Allergy was because of where we're coming to now there's going to be the global equivalent of an intervention here in the Japanese are going to be told that they have to stop inflating themselves on the steroids that are the Chinese resources and land mass and all that and if they don't stop they're going to get the means to that cut off the means are things like oil now worth pointing out cuz it's interesting from a military history standpoint the second world war is really the first be War where oil is this super important resource a war winning or War losing resource at a certain point we all understand most wars throughout history how tall was Boris but most wars have a component of resources involve some way or another now what's interesting is over the air is often the important resource that you need to have changes right during the late Bronze Age having the Monopoly on the making of iron and stuff like that that's a national security thing will iron Steel born in the 20th century but something that wasn't all that important all Petroleum in the Bronze Age is critical in this area I think about the need to have it for your Air Force if nothing else but also you know since the first world war and really before the first world war they started changing over from coal to oil for the fuel for all of their ships all the major Powers well gee that creates a dependency you didn't have before and countries like Japan which didn't have a lot of oil to begin with let's just say almost done a little in the sakhalin islands up North but almost none are in a bind if the people you normally buy oil from decide to squeeze you this is an interesting thing to look at because I remember as a kid growing up I lived through something that if you look in your history books now is a known historical event with long-term huge ramifications that we still with today at the time we just called it the oil crisis when I was a kid in 1973 long story short a cartel of oil-producing Nations 1 to get the United States and friends to change their foreign policy priorities as they related to Israel cuz there was a war in the Middle East going on decided to squeeze the United States and Friends oil supplies to get the price to rise to sort of course might not be a strong enough word petrol blackmail is a were they sometimes used to get the United States to change its foreign policy the attitude that the US government had was completely understandable it predictably attitude they have is no great power is going to let anybody dictate what their foreign policy priority should be there were few people in the Nixon Administration that were basically talking about in a listen if you don't sell the oil at a decent price were to come and take the OU can't monopolize the world depends on like this she can understand the idea of no great Powers going to let another country dictate when its priority should be during this. Of time that's exactly what the Anglo American nations are going to do to the Japanese in the same way it's hard to imagine the United States knuckling-under to the demands of an oil cartel and changing its foreign policy it's hard to imagine the Japanese publicly with their tail between their legs completely altering more than a decade's worth of foreign policy and doing what the great power tells them to do otherwise they won't get any oil which they really needed to run the war machine in China which they wouldn't be in anymore but because it is so obviously something that might lead directly to war there is always been one side of the debate in the United States and elsewhere about how much we're going to talk about now these economic embargoes and sanctions and asset freezes and those kinds of things how much that was a non-violent way to express the moral outrage of the public at the Japanese treatment of the Chinese in all the skies. Versus a shove in a direction that the people in the know understood would lead directly to four that's why we're going to deal with a couple different sides of the debate here because this is not settled stuff unless of course you're a very hard idealog and believe what you believe but there are number different ways to look at it there's a place where power politics and moral outrage intersect Empower politics in a realpolitik and moral outrage from a country like the United States are Great Britain or any of these Western democracies these things are usually at odds with each other mean a lot of times you have people like that are National Security advisor Henry Kissinger who was Nixon's National Security advisor lamented the idea that he should be constrained by the Publix would have weepy attitudes towards nation-states when he's trying to create treaties that keep nuclear war from breaking out when was keep your eyes on the prize here in the nation's interests right and get it the same time how do you expect a public who's reading all this terrible stuff coming out of the War in China and babies being bombed in the people being beheaded and rapes of cities about to happen any minute now in the story how do you tell that public that they should just sit idly by and do nothing what's more what if your country is providing the means necessary for these events Stephen take place where certainly understandable that people might react in fact you might worry about a country's population that didn't in this case with a nation so against going to war one of the options that the president has in a situation like this right well this begins to become clear in October 1937 in a famous speech that the president of the United States Franklin delanor Roosevelt gives this is about a month or two before the Nanking massacre happens but it's on the horizon in the Battle of Shanghai all that's happened and Roosevelt give this speech where he talks about aggressor Nations and he talks about their conduct being like a contagion like a disease that will spread and he Compares it to what you do when people have diseases you quarantine them right and he's suggesting that that's what should be done to these aggressor States here's a sample of the 1937 quarantine speech by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt that's the epidemic of world lawlessness is spreading Advanced Well Physical disease starts to spread the community approves and joins an egg Florentine of the patients in order to protect against the spread of the disease it is my determination it is my determination to adopt Everett practicable Mega involvement in law it's supposed to be inconceivable that in this modern era in the face of experience Any Nation could be so foolish as to run the risk of plunging the whole world by invading and violating in contravention of solemn trailer is the territory of other nations that are real and which are two weeks to protect themselves adequately just a piece of the world and the welfare and security of every nation including our own is today being threatened by that very thing if this seems like a rather weak speech in terms of specifics and what not you wouldn't be the only person that says so Francis Pike seems to indicate that Roosevelt kind of weak on all the stuff for a while he said that this speech was just being a Roosevelt sort of testing the waters but we gave some polling information earlier that gives you an idea about the attitude of the American electorate during this time. If the president of the United States thinks that there's a very important direction that the country needs to go but the country doesn't want to go there what should the president of the United States do it's worth examining this in Neva that is President Franklin Delano Roosevelt for a minute because he's a key part of this story he's unlike any other US president in history he was elected to twice as many terms as any other president in US history they changed the Constitution after he left the scene so that that would never happen again but it gave him an unparalleled amount of actual practical hands-on experience with the levers of government nobody ever move them any better than Franklin Roosevelt did Roosevelt and unusually hard to figure out US president you would think a guy that was on the scene as long as he was would have all sorts of information attached to his feelings about things but he died in office early into the fourth term by the way which meant we didn't get the normal run of presidential Memoirs and all that stuff afterward because even if it's a pack of lies are self-serving justifications historians have a way of using that to really flesh things out and compare them to other events and whatnot triangulate but you don't even get that from Roosevelt and he was a hard to read guy anyway almost by his very nature he still elicits extremely strong emotions in many directions I mean at the time there was a euphemism for him that people who hated his guts used they wouldn't mention his name they call him that man in the White House conservative Americans often saw Roosevelt as damn near socialist man who exploded the size of the American government put it in in all sorts of areas where did never stuck its nose in before transferred money from the wealthier classes to the poorer classes set up all kinds of agencies appear to be doing all kinds of things spending all kinds of money but we're there really any results changing America fundamentally there is a before Franklin Roosevelt and after Franklin Roosevelt America he's arguably the most transformative president that's ever been Again part of it being how long he served but also because when you serve during such major events of the Great Depression followed by the second world war you're going to be around when all kinds of things are transformed and you're going to be trying to ride the storm know as the captain of maybe maybe the most powerful ship in the world to a lot of Americans liberal certainly but a lot of poor destitute Americans of the Great Depression Roosevelt was a hero if he wasn't achieving things it wasn't for lack of trying he was literally doing you know programs were people did all kinds of things that weren't even necessary in the government would hand them out of paycheck although they also did a ton of things that we still benefit from today all kinds of in Oak conservation Coors and all these things that would put people to work simply to put them to work try to prime the pump of the American you cannot make engine and get things going again there were a lot of Americans who had food on the table because of Franklin Roosevelt that'll make you pretty popular might even get you elected four times Defenders would argue that if Roosevelt put in a lot of programs that conservatives thought of as socialist things like Social Security by the way or a Roosevelt a new deal program he was up against competition from other forms of government like bolshevism and fascism the took over and Country for political instability and taking hold due to horrible economic situations in part Defenders would argue that Roosevelt managed to steer the United States away from either one of those extremes and as one of my professors put it gave the country a little socialism to avoid having them demand a lot views on Roosevelt run the gamut Francis Pike in his book about the Pacific War Hirohito swore talks about Roosevelt and points out that the guy is a hard man to figure out at the best of times Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a difficult man to read Henry Wallace his former vice president said of him now Wallace speaking he doesn't know any man no man knows him even his own family doesn't know anything about him according Roosevelt I am like a cat he said about himself I make a stroke and then I relaxed bike says quote loved and respected as a leader seemingly happiest in the company of women he was an enigma detached enigmatic and ruthless while flying over Cairo Roosevelt glanced out the window and said my friend the Sphinx and quote former time editor-in-chief Hedley Donovan who'd met like seven presidents personally new Roosevelt Roosevelt was the first of the presidents that he knew and even wrote a book about all these presidents and in it he said about Roosevelt quote oversimplify is best remembered single statement the only thing we have to fear is fear itself is patently absurd and was probably excellent tonic for a country whose banking system it collapsed but in the early and middle stages of decision-making before it was time to simplify and oversimplify Roosevelt could be impenetrable Rexford tugwell one of the early New Deal Brain Trust Rose wrote now quoting tugwell no one could tell what he was thinking to say nothing of what he was feeling Donovan continues he clearly relished being hard to figure out he likes secrets and had a few he was off and devious for good reason but could also be devious just for the fun of it general Douglas MacArthur who despised him said Roosevelt quoting MacArthur now would never tell the truth when a lie would serve him just as well Donovan continues quote this was considerable slander but FDR unquestionably did enjoy manipulation and maneuver for their own sake all part of the great game of politics and power but then he says he was also a man of deep conviction the dedication and unquenchable idealism he was firm and Serene in his religious faith and had a decent sense of privacy about it it is impossible to imagine him at a congressional prayer breakfast he was impatient with the abstract or theoretical and no sense profound but spacious in vision for America and ultimately all the nation he believed if not in the perfectibility of man in a rather spectacular Improvement in man's behavior worldwide and quote this impenetrability of Roosevelt's though has kind of worked against him in terms of his place in history because it leaves a lot of room for people to speculate about his motor and often times it gets wrapped up with people politics ideologies worldviews and even conspiracy theories Roosevelt's everything from a well-meaning moral Crusader desperately trying to avoid war with Japan while still getting them to change their evil ways two on the very far side of the other Spectrum off and conspiracy land Roosevelt as a man who Engineers this War years in advance organized as it pushes the Japanese into it knows about it in advance and then luckily orders the carriers out of Pearl Harbor just in time so they don't get hurt cuz he's also aware that carriers are going to be in the new battleships in the Modern Age which equation has nobody quite know yet but nonetheless runs the gamut so who is this Franklin Roosevelt guy right sneaky conniving let's remember he was elected originally way back in 1932 to deal with the depression the things he did to deal with the depression were really effective at the time at least in making people feel like somebody was finally doing something he left behind a lot of legacies that people in the United States argue over everything from a bunch of different government departments to things like Social Security Roosevelt looks to me like one of those people who has the reality Distortion field ability that was something Steve Jobs was supposed to have two supposedly a guy like jobs or maybe Roosevelt could convince you that a job that was really hard to imagine anybody doing anything about was totally possible and we're on the way maybe Elon Musk has that ability to but I read that Andy hertzfeld was the one who said that the reality Distortion field was a combination of charm bravado Charisma hyperbole marketing appeasement and persistence and that really sounds like a pretty good description of Roosevelt to me I was not one of the best examples of the fact the Roosevelt possessed disability was that while never not admitting and being open about the information he sort of made the country just forget that he was paralyzed below the waist you got polio is an adult he was confined to a wheelchair you didn't see pictures of that the pictures usually show him a lectern for seated with other world leaders fully appearing completely able-bodied but he didn't hide it really I mean there was talk of it everybody knew but he could just make you forget nowadays be something that was celebrated and exalted in used as an example right of the possibility don't let anything hold you back the president himself or herself uses a wheelchair right but mean that's just Roosevelt was it interesting and interesting sort of Steve Jobs age is not a bad description came but if you didn't like his policies the reality Distortion field almost seems nefarious doesn't it now some of the people who thought Roosevelt most nefarious are the people who wanted to see the United States stay clear of this new world war that had broken out in Europe in a by 1940s we said you have the German Army blowing through France and occupied in Western Europe and by the way the stories coming out from that what a harsh occupation how horrible it is is something that moves public opinion yet again it should be pointed out cuz it probably played into it in a major way that 1940 is a presidential election year in the United States and Roosevelt is running for an unprecedented third term I read one history that print this way when they said that Roosevelt and his Republican opponent were vying to outdo each other with their promises that they would keep the country out of the European War other words there was no opponent running that said that they would get them in the war it was a competition to see who could be most passionate about saying they would stay out of it and when Republican hopeful Wendell willkie charges that the president is secretly trying to get the us into the war or doing things that would get the us into the war Roosevelt issues a denial and then they put it in the Democratic party platform is it over and over again campaign speech not long before the election given in October 1940 we're Roosevelt references all the other times that he said it he says quote I have said this before but I shall say it again and again and again your boys are not going to be sent into any Foreign Wars and quote now can you write that off as a campaign promise if he breaks it is this like you know I won't raise your taxes all well I guess I have to do after he wins there's a problem with this American system too because there's precious few ways for the public to weigh in on foreign policy in the country the presidents or people who want to be the presidents often make promises about foreign policy if they break those promises what does that mean for the ability of the population to influence the country's foreign policy for example some of the people most upset with where Roosevelt is going are people that think that they can see through his lies they see The Miz lies right when he says I'm not trying to get the country anymore they're looking at what's actually happening and Roosevelt is mimicking many of the same things that Democratic President Woodrow Wilson did the year before the US got into the first world war Wilson also promising by the way that he won't get our boys you know to give their blood in the urine War what is it 5 months after he wins the election there there and Roosevelt won't be the last person in the 20th century to do it there was a very interesting argument though that I read by historian Campbell Craig and I hope I get it right on the spirit of it anywhere but he was talking about American history Charles Austin beer who had his reputation destroyed when after the second world war hero to book that treated Roosevelt a little like a criminal in a docket and he was the prosecuting attorney in what he was trying to prove was the Roosevelt was involved in the conspiracy to take the country into the European war against the will of the country and Fred had a very interesting argument he said that some historians are mad at Charles Boston beer for saying that there was a conspiracy in crankset but their conspiracies in the US government all the time and he lifts them peaches the conspiracy is not the problem in the reason the beard was discredited beard was just credited because Roosevelt turned out to have done with the American people afterwards decided they approved of so maybe you could compare him to the way we talked about Churchill in the era were Churchill was on power is bellicose nature was out of touch with the $10 worth of those times could Roosevelt be said to be more far-seeing than the American public they met 95% of them say they don't want to get involved in this European war that maybe Roosevelt knows better and if I read Campbell cry correctly he's saying that the public opinion polls after the war in the approval rating the people have for that in the fact that a guy who didn't want to be in that work Charles Austin beard would have the public turning him cuz it's such an unpopular attitude baby the argument is FDR was right sometimes you have to lead from the front right at the American public aren't ready yet I'm ahead of the curve they will agree with me when we get there although as we said it was an election year and if you want to read the polls a certain way you could argue that Roosevelt was doing exactly what the polling data scenes you want him to do right you have an overwhelming majority that do not want to send our boys over there to fight but you also have an overwhelming majority that want to see Britain and France Prevail so if those are the perimeter is what sort of room for manoeuvre do you have well many of the same things Woodrow Wilson did in the first world war for example you can help the Allies that's a bit of a problem when you're portraying yourself as a neutral country which is officially with the US was betraying itself in the first World War I was to neutral country and you get arguments again General Marine Corps General Smedley Butler I think he's still the most talking about how we were following the same pattern again and we're just going to run into the same kind of problems and that the people in power know this already Charles Austin beard himself eight years before the war predicted it would come from an inch Denver provocation and then there you go well when you have German submarines torpedoing British Merchant ships 5 seconds after they leave the Eastern Seaboard Sports maybe with some Americans on them isn't that just setting up a provocation isn't that exactly like what happened in the first World War I think it's a Life Magazine photograph I think I remember showing the explosion of a tank or something heading for Britain right off the u.s. shore and you can see the lights of like New Jersey's Boardwalk or something in the distance at night you got to be crazy to think that that's not going to lead to something that sucks a country into the war what's more Roosevelt's got an Undeclared sort of War going and it's understandable why you would sending US destroyers out the stock those German submarines right the neutral country but Roosevelt could argue and a lot of Americans would agree hey hey hey we can't have your submarines torpedoing people so close to us an argument can be made at Roosevelt was sort of following he said he was pushing it to the limits of the law but you can make an argument just like you can that he wanted the country into war that he every step of the way was doing the next logical step in a progression and hoping it didn't go any farther certainly you can make a better argument for that in Asia and the Pacific Roosevelt is quoted in a couple of my history books as saying that you didn't want war in the Pacific because you only has one Navy in the implication is he's going to need it in the Atlantic against the Nazis but let's be honest with a guy like this that doesn't mean anything he's much more nuanced than later than that some of the modern histories I've read on this have a very interesting Viewpoint that I hadn't considered which shows you the blind spot in the kind of History's we used to read the more modern history point out things from the other side that make clear things that we forgot and then one of them is that debating whether or not Roosevelt wanted a war against Japan in the Pacific ignores the fact that he already has one it just doesn't involve US troops authors like Franco David macaroni and others essentially refer to the War in China as a proxy war. Just for the United States but for Great Britain who's doing much of the same stuff and the Soviet Union all of whom have an interest in keeping Japan bog down so all of them are at one time or another providing arms resources supplies some of the histories make a case that this becomes a wonderful thing Japanese commanders who been promising great victories in our failing can blame things on and you do once again see the similarities in the Vietnam War era where all of a sudden it all became about the Ho Chi Minh trail if we can just shut down that network of resupply roads down the outside powers like China and the Soviet Union were supplying the North Vietnamese will be able to get their stuff to the moon will win in this case the Japanese become obsessed with shutting off the many me leaking like a sieve cuz it's about the geographical size of the us as we said the Manny resupply points that the Chinese have the Soviets in the north the British are leaking stuff over from Hong Kong to Burma Road their stuff coming over from French Indochina in the u.s. is in fits and starts doing stuff too and they sell at below-cost all kinds of things at one point to the Soviets a deliver like 800 planes and the advisors to teach you how to fly them if you are the Japanese and you need a nice victory in China to free up you know this is a food eating contest in the Japanese sat down to a giant plate of pancakes and they're halfway through the pancakes now and they're starting to realize holy cow I'm not going to make it through this mean while other people are secretly the Soviet Union Great Britain the United States piling more Pancakes on the table when you're not looking at every time you turn around there's more pancakes you're already almost full by 1939 the Japanese want out of China it's like they're addicted to it but they got too much it was an old comic book episode once about that day you know you're going to steal Superman's power and you want it but then you couldn't you couldn't handle it all and you just overdosed on it well the Japanese are looking to figure out a way to have their cake and eat it too in China what that means is how do we get out but leave it in a circumstances where we control it right puppet governments things like that they want to replicate what they did in Manchuria in a now called Manchu call cuz it's Japanese puppet state just like Korea is a lot harder to do that in a place the size of China especially when you haven't defeated China yet and in 1939 the Chinese been a couple of battles against the Japanese boom they weren't ready for that what's more the Japanese who always amongst the Army had a huge contingent of officers that really wanted to attack the Soviet Union got their wish unfortunately and a couple of things that were called incidents were clashes happened between the Red Army and the Japanese Army up there the kwantung Army and the Japanese got their nose severely bloodied 17000 casualties in one of these lights of some reforms in the Japanese Army by the way but also blunted the enthusiasm that had been running in Japanese leadership circles for a crusade against the Soviet Union which also turn Japanese eyes into other directions where things might be gained at less of a cost this is what's known by the way as the north-south debate during this time. In Japanese politics do we go north against the Soviet Union South against those possessions they're not so well defended now by the colonial Masters Japanese sources invariably focus on two things that we in the west don't focus on his much China and communism Subaru e n I got years ago was pointing out going to keep your eye on the prize the Japanese aren't this is all about China to them all these other things that happened including the war with United States and all of this is an attempt to figure out how to solve their China war situation to their satisfaction and communism is the other thing that they focus on inordinately and we in the west forget that to that it's fair I think to call Japan the most fervently large anti-communist country in the world during this time. That's really saying something in a cage where Nazi Germany exists but the Japanese hate communism and they portray and they tell themselves and they using propaganda with their public and maybe there's even some truth to it that this war in China is in large part of war against communism they have their own version of what the West will have ten or twenty years after this. Where the West will be worried about the domino effect communism spreads one country to another you like dominoes the Japanese have their same so that attitude here that's going to move through China and then it's going to come to Japan so they don't stop it over there before it comes over to the Homeland meanwhile they're telling themselves that they're paying all this money sacrificing all these lives in an effort to keep and protect the Chinese people who haven't fallen under communism sway free that even to roll back communism in free Chinese people who are the slaves of the Bolshevik and Lenin the stinkers you go talk to a Japanese parent who lost a son in that fighting you're likely to hear some sort of rationale like that after all is that what you would like to think your son died for other people's freedoms it's a pretty high might have caused a lot of people Sons on all sides in a lot of Wars of dying for things like that now China of course is going to become as we said like an intervention the big sticking point that it's hard to see anyone overcoming because the Japanese in their minds have to get some sort of deal in China just like the US had to get some sort of deal in Vietnam were a kid gets the boxes ticked off that it needs to get so we can leave in Japan's case those boxes really are control of China's resources this is not something that the Western powers are prepared to let them have so how do you get around that well we had said that your pan was basically being confronted with an intervention by the anglo-american powers they pull if you want to look at it this way something more like a Kobayashi Maru from Star Trek you're like a third way you didn't know I had a third option right give up the drugs were going to cut off your money so you can't buy drugs will maybe I have friends after the Germans blow through Western Europe in 1940 right around the same time the Japanese sign an alliance with them it's called The tripartite Pact that he was late September 1940 create something called the axis and the Axis powers because Italy will join and some other fascists leaning countries smaller country to be named later this is a unification of the outside countries in terms of the club all these countries want some sort of autarky self-sufficiency and unfortunately for all of them none of them have oil when Romania lean that way that'll help a little but the Japanese joining the Axis powers is one of the Fatal missteps and pain terrible moves that leads to tragedy for everyone in Asia and it's often pointed out that it should have been avoided had you had a different kind of government with a different system of making decisions you might have avoided the way things went because if you actually look at what people felt like including the emperor there were tons of people in the Japanese power structure that wanted nothing to do with a conflict with the United States and Britain avoid that at all costs so how do you end up there I always a ton of missteps and miscommunication and misinterpretation and mistranslations how about the mystery that happens when the Japanese foreign minister who signs this deal this access agreement how about his misread of how the United States would react this guy's name of the ways matsuoka and he is prominently portrayed in all the history books his importance and influence are sometimes debated but this is a guy who owned his resume essentially calls himself the American expert he graduated from University of Oregon he worked in the United States and goes back to Japan and he's the guy who thinks signing an agreement with Nazi Germany is going to help give you leverage against the United States if that's how they're going to react Japan was hoping for someone who would even up the scales a little bit in terms of its negotiating power against the west and when you read what they were hoping for including what the Prime Minister was hoping for they felt like they needed somebody on their side otherwise you couldn't negotiate with the Americans from any sort of position to parody much less strength and I think you kind of have to call it about 50% effective when examining results because it kind of did Scare the Americans and get their attention and force a response to 50% of the deal though there was not successful is it wasn't the response that Japanese were thinking they were going to get it didn't make the Americans back off and think maybe they'd better be more cautious here because otherwise maybe we'll be fighting the luftwaffe in the Pacific and the Vera mock will be defending some of these Japanese defense perimeter islands in the Japanese were certainly hoping that that might be the case and if you look at some of the promises the Nazis were making to the Japanese when trying to convince them to sign this agreement which they tried to do the year before apparently to they were sort of hinting that that's how it would be right up if you could do a war with United States with the right there unfortunately for the Japanese that's a worst-case scenario for the Americans to in a situation that maybe they could have looked the other way for a while and focused on Europe when it was just Japan which had a limited amount of ability to really threaten the United States looked a lot more like something that had to be dealt with right away when it's the Eastern wing of the axis Alliance in the tentacles are now stretching out over the Pacific in the US is facing a war on both fronts you don't walk away with your tail between your legs when that's the situation you take it with an amount of deadly seriousness the amount of diplomatic flexibility the Japanese are going to have after signing this agreement with the Nazis is severely limited compared to what it was before that state they weren't ready for this fact that they were going to be lumped in now with people who had some of the worst press you can get in the western democracies in the Japanese PR wasn't good already we talked about the Life magazine photos of the babies being bombed in China on all these kinds of things up in the minds of the American public with people who are diametrically opposed to the Western values that are trumpeted the celebrated you know you can flip a coin who's more opposed the stalinist see in the Soviet Union or the Nazis in Germany none the less people are book burners they persecute minorities and have government-sanctioned programs like Crystal Knox there against freedom of thought freedom of speech freedom of religion they don't have any due process they don't believe in equality under the law they have a harsh occupy and they believe in Collective punishment they pry mean the list goes on and on and the Japanese have now thrown in their lot in the eyes of the Americans with that crowd how much less willing to come to sort of an accommodation with the Imperial Japanese government are the American people going to be now and how long on Earth did a guy who graduated from the University of Oregon and worked in the United States get that one so wrong to be fair another aspect of this that we in the west don't always think about is the fact that the way the second world war looks to us is not necessarily the way it looks to a bunch of the rest of the world especially places like Asia in the west we see this as good versus evil in Asia in a lot of these countries that were under colonial rule at this time it's a lot more questionable if it's a good guy bad guy thing it might be too bad guys from their point of view destroying John toland in a book that was written Way Back in 1970 but still has some value inside it despite being outdated in other respects including what we know about the emperor but I mean he has a whole part admittedly trying to look at this from the Asian perspective that points out that you know if you don't see the Western democracies is all that good at a lot of Asia had bought into the promises the high-minded sentiments from the first world war about self-determination and all these things that we fight for it and people getting to have you know their own States and having all that stuff was kind of believed in his several of the freedom fighters in these countries and pointed out a lot of the locals who died for those causes only to find out after the war they didn't apply to them it was a racial thing and even in this conflict there's going to be exceptions for Colonial peoples when the high-minded sentiments are trotted out again is the reason why we fight in this case as Towing points out there were a lot of people in countries in Asia who were darn happy I see anybody punching their colonial Masters in the face even if they didn't like those people so much if you wanted to look at this as a strategic war game right now the way I like to do these things and you try to figure out if your Japan how you ever win in the victory conditions for Japan me only Italy of the major player seems harder to me but they hope their wagon to Nazi Germany Japan's a long way away from anybody at the only way they can win is to roll like a double zero on the percentile dice but a double zero is this weird possibility that they know what they're calling the greater East Asia co-prosperity sphere that that actually works even though a lot of the cynical people behind it you don't even want it to work but it in this I imagine if you could somehow free Asia and be sort of the boss people of it will all of a sudden you open up all kinds of possibilities that aren't there otherwise but this is why throughout this situation even when the Japanese are undercutting this message of Asia for the Asians by raping and pillaging and doing all kinds of horrible things to other Asians the idea has a lot of appeal and sometimes you will run into quotes from famous people Gandhi is one of the Mohandas Gandhi that make him look like a Nazi sympathizer either taken out of context to contact that needs to be added back for to make some sense is this idea that oh yeah the Nazis are bad but we didn't see the colonial oppressor is all that great either and the really bad guy was doing something that weekend our local bad guy and that was a good thing you know the enemy of my enemy is my friend the point is is that there are other ways to look at this and if you're trying to look at it from a grand strategy point of view it's like what was always said about the great mistake and the inability of the Nazis to capitalize on some of these peoples that they took over eventually when war will break out in the Soviet Union because they could have come in there as liberators and they were welcomed by the locals as liberators they could have been the great free years of the people under communist domination but because of their racial theories and their harshness and whatnot they ended up turning a lot of those people against them the Japanese didn't have those theories theoretically standing in the way they could have freed Asia and what would that have allowed them to do their problem of course is that they sort of wanted to take a shower while freeing it burn down the village in order to save it cheap China while somehow getting rid of the responsibility of fighting it in policing it and expand in the other territories even though we are totally tied down in China once again it boggles the mind looking at it from the perspective of somebody sitting on the sidelines now but Japan obviously has its hands full and yet the real debate for it in 1940 is out can we get something else and then we said all of a sudden the Soviet Union seems like a little bit too steep of a hill to climb right now so after they Ally with the Nazis are really right around the same time there are able to arm-twist is a good way to put it lean on is another way the puppet French government that the Germans are put into place after they conquered France and move militarily into what's now Northern Vietnam a piece of French Indochina this is kind of spark that starts the dynamic that leads now kind of very clearly and straightforwardly war fights a chicken and an egg thing because you will get Japanese folk who will say two things one this is just an attempt to shut down another one of these leaky areas where support is coming in for the Chinese and everybody wants us to wind up this War in China what we can't do that if he supplies keep coming in right we're just trying to do what you want us to do the other thing though is that it they're going to have their raw materials cut off their looking for ways to supplement that in one of the ways to take the ones that are nearby and unlike you know anything that might be up in the Soviet Union these are hardly well defended at all and simply by using bullying diplomacy the Japanese occupy the northern part of French Indochina the reaction on the u.s. and Britain and the Netherlands part is to ratchet up the sanctions now the next big thing that happens that really influences this story is that just about a little bit over a year from when the world is turned upside down and the Germans take France in Western Europe the Germans turn the world upside down again and then even more shocking fashion in June 1941 the Axis powers in Europe launched a surprise attack against the Soviet Union to say that sounds ridiculous because when you're launching an attack that is several times the size of Napoleon's invasion of Russia in the early 1800s with the Grand Army Angus 500000 guys in the Grand Army multiple Nations several times that and on a front that stretches from like the width of a continent how the hell does that stay secret there were plenty of warning but one way or another if I had the same effect as a surprise attack and initially and very quickly the bear moth especially but the axis armies in general appear to be having the same kind of success that the Germans had blowing through France the year before again and they are surrounding and annihilating not Red Army units but red Army's and once again the rest of the world is looking on in shock and trying to reassess what the heck this means this is the last strand of Japanese foreign policy we have to leave into the story because if you're a conservative lie oriented person like I am and like many of the Japanese leaders were to there looking just like I would be looking to thinking that have their hands full with China yet there's this impetus to not miss the bus as one of the sayings of the time we're to miss the bus a golden opportunity is the way another person put in that these changes in the global balance of power offer there's a decent case to be made the Japanese foreign policy since they rejoin the rest of the world in the latter part of the nineteenth Century has always had a Keen Eye for opportunity and you never do any better than they did in the first world war the Day game so much for almost nothing but they were very opportunistic they were allied with the British in the Allies remember and they gained mightily but they're trying to figure out what the opportunistic play is here and have a couple of different competing things going on competing thing number one we already mentioned there's quite a few people in the Japanese power structure that want no trouble at all with Britain in the United States traditionally it's the Navy that is most credited in Churchill often you know where the most sympathetic Lisa was going to have to be the one fighting it and they knew that the British and the American fleets were the two largest bleach in the world and you be fighting them combined in a war the Army could Puffs out its chest and make also it's a brave statements all it wanted to if they weren't going to be handling a lot of shooting action than a few wise but there's also the two other elements that we mentioned earlier that need to be pointed out are still in play here and it's crazy the first one is the mid-level Military Officers are still having an impact these kernels and people of these sorts of rank who don't have any of the responsibility of having to live with the ramifications of the decisions they push they can just in an aggressive and almost pugnacious Manor aggressively push forward with their policies and for some reason their superiors tend to be a little bit lenient or lacks order 10 to defer it puts a lot of pressure though towards aggressive stances that shouldn't otherwise be there the other thing of course it's exerting influence in that direction and it must play into the head of anybody that thinks wait a minute we need to back down now this is going in a very negative direction is the fact the reason Japanese history demonstrates that you're likely to get somebody killing you if you try to move like that didn't you say it was only a few years before some historians were describing the Japanese government is a government by assassination that's still a problem and if you're too well let's just say none super-patriot you could find yourself shot or your head cut or any number of other things that were happening during this. And they were certainly lots of threats and and being anything other than the super Patriot at this time. Is to open yourself up to suspicion and maybe imprisonment so let's remember the climate these people are operating in but even the Prime Minister of Japan during this time. He aggressively sometimes makes public statement but he does not want a war with Britain and the United States and France and the emperor apparently doesn't want that either to how do you get it again well this golden opportunity this don't miss the bus moment that this change in the global situation seems to influence now that the vert mocked is I'm cutting through the Western regions of the Soviet Union is to maybe take the rest of French Indochina and start making a few public statements to the effect that you know maybe some deals going to have to be reached for the supplies we need or want to have to you know maybe move South some more and so right around the time the Germans attack the Soviet Union the Japanese again quite bloodlessly but mostly blood that Liesel to move into the rest of French Indochina Laos Cambodia Vietnam and this is the Line in the Sand for places like the United States not just because they have been trying to get the Japanese food in the other direction and it's like a slap in the face when they go the opposite way but also because his more modern historians a pointed out the raw materials that they're actually getting their hands on this area are raw materials just like the US need as well so now it's not just about cutting Japan off it's about Japan cutting the United States off from things they need this is a heavy-duty rubber area for example so this is when the serious sanctions start and it's funny because the negotiating position originally start somewhere in the area of you need to get out of French Indochina which is something that's kind of possible but eventually we'll move into the area of know you need to tell us when you're getting out of China entirely and it's got to be relatively soon the sounds like a nuanced position but it's pretty easy to explain once again if you go back to our Vietnam War analogy at Emagine that together the Soviet Union and China during that. The two other powers that might be considered to be great powers that could counterbalance us drink if they had said to the United States in 1967 you know when the Vietnam war is going I mean it hits a long long slog towards even defeat at that point if they'd said listen are you got to get out of here give us a timetable for when you're getting out a timetable can't be like forever maybe a year right if the United States leaves Vietnam in 1968 it's the same as saying you're giving up and losing the war because the war is far from Over the American position on China is we need a timetable for withdrawal and it's got to be soon. Have to be in 5 minutes I'll be soon it's it may be designed to be too soon for the Japanese to do anything that they would consider to be winning and then go home this is the intervention right get out of China or we're going to cut off your ability to do what you're doing anymore this is the fuse being lit now the Winston Churchill I like to quote Churchill for the story because he is a participant in the story he has his own way of viewing things and he's he's not unbiased by any stretch of the imagination but he's interested on the Japanese cuz he kind of likes the Japanese and admires their martial culture and when Churchill was in his formative stages the British and the Japanese were allies also as a colonialist himself as as an Empire guy himself he can understand the desire in the field the colonies are not inherently an evil thing we talked about the Japanese and of course he dictated or recorded in a machine these histories that he wrote about the conference they sound like him they sound like Churchill talking to you but he sort of incapsulate so what happens here in his own way with a little Sympathy for the Japanese Winston Churchill rights quote the DraStic application of economic sanctions in July 1941 brought to a head the internal crisis in Japanese politics conservative elements were shocked and a moderate leader scared the domestic Prestige of the Japanese Army is a constitutional factor in shaping Japanese policy was already involved hitherto the Navy had exerted it's restraining for but the embargoes which the United States Britain and Holland head in Forest cut off from Japan all supplies of oil on which the Navy and indeed the whole war power of Japan depend did the Japanese Navy was at once forced to live on its oil reserves and at the outbreak of the Pacific War had in fact consumed 4 out of 18 month supply it was evident that this was a Stranglehold edit the choice before them was he there for Japan to reach an agreement with the United States or go to war the American requirements involved Japanese withdrawal not only from their new aggression in Indochina but from China itself where they had already been fighting and heavy expense for so long this was he writes a rightful but I'll hard demand in these circumstances the Navy Associated itself with the Army in the policy of War if an acceptable diplomatic agreement could not be obtained and quote he puts forward the old idea by the way that the Navy doesn't want the war but because of the sanctions in the cutting off a fuel supply slowly but surely will maybe not even that slowly the Navy begin to move toward the Army position of these things and more hard-line and tie anglo-american position what are more points out to the government that the fleet is burning 400 tons of oil an hour the overall military need is something like twelve thousand tons a day another official or Admiral its disputed it supposed to told the government that this is like a patient who's going to die without surgery that he's still made I even with the surgery but if you don't give him the surgery his Death is certain so another words that showing the position that solve the Japanese now think they find themselves in one of certain death and less risky and still no potentially fatal countermeasures are taken now I should point out that while some people say and Francis bikes pretty the Surfers that every one of these Roosevelt people knew that once you put oil on The Chopping Block that this basically meant the Japanese were going to go to war but in his a modern history of Japan is during James McClain says that Secretary of State Cordell Hull didn't see it that way he really thought you could get the Japanese to see reason through something like this in other words if true this was the peaceful attempt right there between the two World Wars attitude sort of attempt to get another country to do the right thing and not just the right thing for you but in the long run the right thing for them McClain says quote as a situation in China worsened after 1937 Secretary of State Hall became the primary proponent of waging an economic Cold War against Japan in his view Japan's Reliance on the American market for strategic goods made the smaller Nation particularly vulnerable to economically sanctions and the systematic application of ever greater amounts of pressure would at some point he believed bring the Japanese to their senses the Secretary of State realize that he had to be careful about his calibrations he did not wish to push Japan into a shooting war with the United States but he did mean to convince the country's leaders about the Folly of playing a high-stakes game in which the United States could continually up the economic Auntie at some point Hollow hoped model Ridgewood return to power in Tokyo Japan with folded hand and peace would be possible and quote this is why we had brought up the the history of Japan from before this era to sort of set up the context and let's just call it the national psyche of Japan during this time. And of course I don't pretend to know about it it's something that everybody talks about the fact that the Japanese have what we call it a rain man like laundry list of grievances places where they think they've been shafted by the rest of the International Community where they feel like they've been treated as second-class and that some of this is racially oriented and in the minds of a lot of those people this just looks like the biggest baddest example of the same thing over again what do you supposed to do about that and certainly asking the Japanese to give up more than any of these previous cases because this War in China has already cost something like a hundred thousand Japanese lives untold amounts of money effort the intense work of a generation of Japanese Statesman what's the likelihood in reality of Japan choosing anything other than war in the situation that's why so many people have suggested that it's an ultimatum by the time the United States is talking about get out of China or we're cutting off your raw materials and oil the Japanese certainly saw it that way and it was interesting he pointed out that it's not true and it's not true because all of the ideas that made this look like an ultimatum were part of a of a Japanese construct they created this artificial time deadline that put them behind the 8-ball if you ignore the time deadline you could have months maybe even longer to negotiate but because you want to keep the option of going to war open there's as much of an artificial deadline limiting the time to go she enters have to solve this problem some other way and they had in the first world war in the first world war was all about in a mobilization time tables and War plans that required precise in a troop movements and people getting on schedule to places otherwise the whole War who go down so you know that limited the time people had to do anything other than carry out the plans in this conflict it's the fact that the Japanese Fleet is burning 400 tons of oil an hour and the fleet isn't the only part of the Japanese military or the larger Japanese society that needs fuel it's worse than that though and it's easy to forget Francis pipe describes something that sounds benign you know we can all understand the oil question but what about the financial squeezing that's involved here what does that mean he writes quote the evening of 25th July 1941 Roosevelt signed executive order number 8832 which subjected all of Japanese monetary assets held in the United States to control by license the White House Press release stated that quote this measure in effect brings all Financial in Import and Export trade transactions in which Japanese interests are involved under the control of the government imposes criminal penalties for violation of the order and quote the order Pike rights extended to Japanese colonies including Manchu qual and China to protect them from looting by Japan's puppet government installed in Nanking all assets owned 25% or more by Japanese interests were frozen when Wall Street open for business on Monday 28th July the Foreign Exchange Market for Yen the Japanese currency simply disappeared Japanese dollar bonds crash to 20 to 30% of their par value the Yokohama still kicks change closed the New York commodity exchange suspended silk Futures and affect the entire Japanese International payment system seized up Japan's gold held in America became immovable and unusable in South America modest amounts of gold in foreign exchange were similarly immobilized by governments that followed Roosevelt's lead cargos destined for America remain stuck on Japanese Ward's when Great Britain and Holland followed America's lead the Yen could only be used and traded with in Japan Zone Empire and quote another way to put that is catastrophic the Japanese are also well aware that this imbalance between the United States and Japan is growing everyday not just because Japan's getting weaker every day but because the US is getting stronger every day 1940 the US essentially starts its rearmament efforts and starts gearing up for war initiate the first peacetime draft in the country's history begins tripling budgets and spending all kinds of money that just the year before Congress would have laughed at the idea of appropriating Germans taking over Western Europe and being so dominant has a way of shocking Congress sometimes into making up for lost time the American system throughout most of its history just for clarification purposes has been one that's been somewhat suspicious of standing armies and the lesson that the people who designed the Constitutional framework of the u.s. believed that standing army stood in opposition to long-term Liberty and so while the US Navy has always been something that's been paid attention to obviously when you have two giant moat surrounding your hemisphere makes sense to pay attention to something that you have to spend some time in advance building you can't just say oh we have a war let's build a Navy usually don't have the Navy in time to use if that's the case where is armies in the old saying a Roman legion style of the Republic you can sort of build from a hardcore veterans and that's what the US military the Army was traditionally like this these long service professionals but not very many of them there whenever war was going to happen all of a sudden you found yourself with all sorts of volunteers and Davy Crockett types and Rough Riders and maybe even some French pirates from time to time whatever you needed to get the job done there always enough Americans looking for a little action that you could raise enough troops without any soda draft or whatever and of course when the war was over they all went home in Liberty Safe it should be pointed out that even though the United States is industrial capability had been hinted at in the first world war the US was still gearing up by the time the war ended and it was a us that was nowhere near as industrialized as the second world war us was when Hitler and his staff people were giving briefings somewhat this is a famous Story by the way we're giving briefings on the industrial capabilities of the u.s. you know if and when it ramped up the numbers that they were given turned out to be low but they laughed at them figuring they were Fabrications so when you put yourself in the other side shoes and you say you know why the heck do they think they can pull off anything like this let's remember that they didn't quite understand and maybe even Americans didn't either the capabilities of the United States once fully mobilized for war and 1940 is the year the mobilization begins Ernest and it's a catch-up effort because the US is very far behind the powers that have been at War now for years in the case of Japan remember this Chinese incident started in 1937 the other shiny zaferes started in 1931 I mean their troops have been on the ground fighting for a long time and they've developed a lot of practical experience the US Army is a green force if there ever was one that's not to say that the US doesn't have some advantages and its back pocket take for example the fact that in many cases the US is reading the Japanese secret messages they continually despite the Japanese belief that this is impossible they continually break Japanese codes from your the 1930s all the way into the War years they don't always have all the codes broken so it's hard to understand why if they knew about a why didn't they know about be but for example their reading a lot of the Diplomatic codes during this. So while the Japanese were the Americans Americans are often able to read the messages the Japanese said to each other or the ones they sent over to the Germans and a little bit of an advantage in the negotiations doesn't it by the summer of 1941 negotiations are not going well at all positions seem to be hardened and you begin to see this Dynamic that we talked about earlier this is sliding towards War I always think about it like a car accident I once had on a sheet of ice and Colorado I was parked I release the emergency brake and I watched my car just slowly slide down hill picking up speed as it went until it smashed into another parked car I watched it in slow motion but I could do nothing to stop and I was powerless and in some of the histories that's the way it looks like even the Japanese leadership feel in this situation right there's there's not many Rara people about the possibility of doing this and you wonder to yourself if there's such a sense of gloom and foreboding why on Earth are they stopping it it's one of those questions always comes into play about the emperor we mentioned it earlier the emperor supposedly has the power to stop a war like this before it starts me he stopped the war eventually if you can do it then why can't you stop it before it starts these were questions after the war that he was put to in this case the guy who's the prime minister's perhaps the next best person to look at and say why didn't you do more well at this time. All the sudden he decides to and it's a little bit like trying to atone for past sins he's an interesting character who gets a lot of criticism he's a prince last name is Canelo and he was the Prime Minister twice earlier on he's the saber-rattling pro-nazi guy is it showing her Burpee big says you know quote after the Manchurian Incident kanoa have been reciprocally anti anglo-american and pro-german on January 21st 1941 he declared firmly before a secret session of the diet that quote Germany will win and quote now he was just as sure that Germany would lose and also sure that the senior officers of both Services could not promise a Japanese Victory and quote this guy all of a sudden seems to have like a crisis of confidence and this is what brings the human element back into the story if you see the slow motion car crash happening and it's going to kill lots of innocent people you know when you're the Prime Minister and you have half of a soul here what would you try to do Japanese historian re hota describes a conversation he had with another sort of member of the aristocracy supposedly the only kind of people he could show his true self to and he creates one of these figures where you kind of feel bad for the guy even though a lot of this is sort of his fault can always looking for a way out of this mess and he thinks if he can have a one-on-one conversation with President Roosevelt maybe they can solve this maybe they can stop the cars slowly sliding into the other Park Vehicles right can you avoid disaster can you repair the damage you caused and by the way she's talking about several of these Japanese aristocracy people so when I give you some names that's who they are she writes quote at that time say R&G was preoccupied with helping cannoli arrange a meeting with Roosevelt say auntie in many of his blue-blooded friends knew that a war with the West would be unwinnable Matsumoto chiharu the yale-educated journalist who was a direct descendant of another illustrious Meiji oligarch shared so young G's concern quote I have made a big mistake on Japan's relations with China and quote kinue can fight it to him in a show of vulnerability displayed only to his social equals the prime minister went on to Lament holding can only hear the former you know pro-fascist pro-nazi guy quote I'm so ashamed to cannot face up to my ancestors I do not want to repeat such a mistake and I want to avoid war with the United States at all costs if it all possible I want to improve sino-japanese relations as well I will give it my best shot so won't you help me and quote it's interesting to wonder about a guy in a position like that whosoever has a a moment where he wants to undo stop maybe see he's in a Flash or maybe a slowly developing realization the ramifications of what's involved here how to describes a Japanese life insurance sale to its people right during this time. Is a way to make money right because they're in circle by all the other powers and she brings it all home though when she talks about well let me have her explain that she writes quote Japan's leaders let the Diplomatic crisis Brew meanwhile its people remained ignorant of such developments in a sweeping national campaign to raise money citizens were urged to buy National Life Insurance in mid-july it was announced with great Fanfare that 50 million policies have been sold Japan's population was about 73 million raising 10 billion yen almost 40% of the country's gross national product for 1941 most of that money she writes went to purchase government bonds to fund Japan's War in China little did people know that their lives would become very cheap even worthless thanks to the government they so earnestly supported with their hard-earned hard save money and quote not just that but this is where the Uber patriotism of the Japanese come into play here as we said earlier like everyone else only more so I still feel like there was a New York Times article just before the war broke out it was quoted in John tolins book The Rising Sun where someone over in Asia is trying to explain to the American public you're not to downplay the Japanese national spirit and what they're willing to do hey it's funny because if you think of many other countries in a situation with their government gets them in an unwinnable War where the costs will be everything to everyone they might overthrow that government rather than go to war that the Japanese people are different if you could have shown the leadership a crystal ball that only showed 5 years into the future that have given up anything you have made any concessions in any sort of diplomatic deal the barring that they could count on the support of a people that takes patriotism to new levels literally the day before War breaks out they'll be a cable sent the New York Times by one of their people who is in Japan and understands the situation they're better his name is Otto talicious and the cable says that the Japanese people are refusing to believe that they're just about to get into a war with four nations simultaneously think about how many governments would be overthrown by their people if those governments got them in the situation that hopeless but the Japanese are a different class of folk and this writer is trying to point out to the New York Times readership exactly what things look like from the other side and don't underestimate these people after saying that the Japanese don't believe that they're about to face for nation simultaneously he continues by saying quote but their instinctive hopes are daily contradicted by the evidence of their senses they listen to alarm in statements by the highest government officials about the greatest prices Japan has ever faced in or 2600 your history they are called to mass meetings to hear denunciations of the enemy and they read steady War clamor in the Press they see are shelters in water reservoirs being built everywhere in preparation for Air Raids they are being drilled in Air Raid Offense especially in fighting fires the greatest rid of Japanese cities finally they see taxes and prices rising they know that all these things are not done for fun and that war real war which only a short time ago seems so very far away is rapidly stretching out its fiery arms towards nipon land of the Gods the cable continues quote the people do not want war but neither do they want to give up the fruit the war that they have been fighting which is costume such a lot of blood and treasure they have been told that this war is a war of self-defense to obtain Elbow Room for the Japanese people crowded into a few small islands with few national resources and to liberate 1,000 million of Oriental people's from exploitation by the white races it would be a great mistake the cables continues to assume that the Japanese are so war-weary that they would be reluctant to fight if War really came to their land or that their War potential is a small or straighten as the outward picture might suggest as members of a Divine family state in which patriotism and religion merge they not merely say my country right or wrong but they're convinced with all the fervour of religious faith that our country is right whatever mistakes in tactics individual states but may take and quote by the way it's this fervor something that sometimes wrapped up into something the Japanese call the Yamato spirit that those Optimus were hoping for a positive outcome in any conflict with the west or sort of basing their hopes on right if you look at 20th Century history by the way there's a lot of places that have tried to overcome industrial and material and balances by saying things like while we're tougher or are fighting Spirits better or what have you and the Japanese have no choice but to put their hopes in the same sort of rationales after all if the government gets a meeting right around this time. Where they're told that Japanese industrial capabilities even with all the steroids of the Chinese raw materials and everything else are 120th of the United States has abilities and by the way that number is a low projection as well so the Prime Minister Prince can put forward and wants to have a meeting with Roosevelt in an attempt to it sounds like in a used as intricate Japanese governmental system in a way where he plays chess with the military officials and uses the emperor the nuclear bomb piece on the chessboard to sort of Checkmate this war that's coming in and he says he needs the agreement with Roosevelt needs to come back with something so he proposes disagreement with Roosevelt Roosevelt can't come right away cuz he's meeting secretly with Winston Churchill on some Naval vessels in the Atlantic and they'll come out of it with something that's known to history is the Atlantic Charter a template for the governance of the post second world war world is the shorthand but there's a lot of high-minded Woodrow Wilson type stuff in it self-determination people should be able to elect their own government a bunch of stuff that if you want the Japanese looks like it's directed squarely at you we celebrated in the United States and high school textbooks here and this is the kind of high-minded Western Democratic idealistic stuff that we've lost a lot of human beings fighting Wars for those kind of values but if you're the Japanese and someone saying that you know we're going to go to war to shut down Nations who won't let people choose their own governments will what does that say about China right you're not choosing the Japanese the governor so it sounds like it's directed at them what's more it looks very hypocritical especially to peoples in Asia when the British are on board with this because the British are one of the great maybe the greatest of the colonial peoples and so are you saying that this Atlantic Charter applies to you too are you signing on the dotted line and saying that you're going to let people in India vote if they want to have the British government have the role of British government has in India in the 1930s for example and Churchill goes on to clarify like a month or two later no no no we're talking a fascist an access dominated lands here when I'm talking about you know Singapore once again no to the peoples in Asia this looks a little like okay it's World War 1 all over again these high-minded sediments don't apply to us and even though the Japanese are raping China as they conquer it they may not look as bad to Asians as they do to the people in the western democracies Roosevelt is apparently open to the idea of a meeting with the Japanese prime minister when he hears about it but his advisors kind of shut it down the Japanese have just rejected the latest diplomatic proposals and the advisor say list of those need to be clarified before we meet now as we just discussed though how long can you put this off when The Fleets burning 400 tons of fuel in our rights of this becomes another one of the problems and I'm not going to get into all the many things that happened in the last 6 months it's a great era to look at if you are a fan of diplomatic history the tit-for-tat things that go on but also the Mini Miss assessments misinterpretations Miss readings and the mistranslations that happened I mean in a famous case they'll be some Christian missionaries in the story well-meaning folk or trying to help everyone of vertica tastrophe hear that the Japanese think are working you as a bat channel for the US government but really aren't and this confuses matters for a while I mean it's one of these occasions where you wish you had with the Soviet Union in the United States had at one point in the Cold War the bat phone the red phone hotlines you can just call up the Emperor or the head of the Japanese government and talk to them directly the instant translation but you didn't have that but even if you did is there enough room on the core issues to compromise on any of this stuff one of the compromises that the Prime Minister had to make to even reach out to Roosevelt was a deal apparently with the army that if the diplomacy didn't work he'd set a timetable for war on the diplomacy didn't work apparently pinoybay who Bears a significant amount of responsibility for getting Japan into this mess didn't want to sign off on your the ramifications of it and have his John Hancock any War declarations or anything he didn't see any way out he said the emperor and basically gone over to the other side now and so what's the point and resigns the emperor replaces him with one of the more hawkish figures out there the head of the war Ministry former General in the kwantung Army a man whose nickname was the razor the name is Hideki Tojo when now we haven't placed the entire leadership that you're normally dealing with when you talk about this conflict Tojo in the American war propaganda was simply turned into the figure that Americans could hate in the same way that they had Hitler and Mussolini he's a dictator of Japan is the way it's portrayed in this continued for decades after the war because this became part of the propaganda that help Shield the emperor from war crimes charges and by the way several modern historians think the emperor might have been executed for war crimes and those charges been allowed to happen but if you say the emperor is a puppet with no power and you say he's a tool of the militarists how do you say this General tojo's the head of the militarists will then you just transferred all the first wartime responsibility to decide their figure and that's what the American propaganda kind of did to tell Joe looks like your typical Japanese Hardline or general but not as far as some of those Imperial Way faction people you can't really say he's like a Hitler or Mussolini or a Stalin because unlike them he has a boss a boss that it's likely that he saw as the living embodiment of a God that's a very different situation than someone like Stalin or Hitler for example it also means that he has to do what he's told there's a lot of theories on the emperor for all the reasons we talked about but one of them is that this move to put this Army General in control is not what most people think it is most people think this is a sign that they've given in their going to go to war if you're going to go to war they want to general in charge but some people say that no this is actually the emperor is sneaky attempt to avoid war this is a minority point if you obviously but those who push this idea suggests that it's a Nixon goes to China kind of situation the ol Switcheroo the Emperor of which one of the really big noisy Hawks to this position of prime minister he has all the respect of the other Hawks and militarists and then you the Emperor or someone this person sees potentially as the Living God orders this Hawk to make peace somehow without war and then he'll cover your rear end with the other military strike as he's got total credibility it's an interesting Theory one thing is for sure is that the emperor orders Tojo to pursue diplomacy until the last possible minute and he follows the emperor's orders but he's working with a deadline now and it's a deadline to change has a couple of times but eventually becomes a hard deadline where you have all over Asia now preparations in place men are on the Move shipping is being co-opted things are happening in preparations are underway unless something intervenes to stop now this momentum things are going to happen as well be said in the future automatically the inertia we've been talking about for a while now is becoming almost Unstoppable in the final deadline now for some sort of diplomatic breakthrough is the end of November there's a lot of different interpretations about Hideki Tojo the kind of guy he is one thing you never read about him though is any sort of suggestions that he was insane and yet that's basically what Winston Churchill is saying that any Japanese government that would allow their country to slip into a war with the Anglo Americans at this point is crazy suicidal is the way I think he puts a Churchill rights in a right after the war quote and it seemed impossible that your pan Wood Court destruction by war with Britain in the United States and probably Russia in the end a declaration of war by Japan could not be reconciled with reason I felt sure she would be ruined for Generation by such a plunge and this proved true but governments and people do not always take rational decisions sometimes they take mad decisions for one set of people get control to compel all others to obey an aid them in Folly I have not hesitated to record repeatedly he writes my disbelief that Japan would go mad however sincerely we try to put ourselves in another person's position we cannot allow four processes of the human mind and Imagination to which reason offers note key he sums up though by saying quote Madness is however and affliction which in war carries with it the advantage of surprise in the quote the word surprise is italicized in the original in order to get a little background on how any surprise might take place when you're talking about powers that are so far away from each other you got to go back to 1940 or 1941 late 1941 industry go back to 1940 when that's part of the demonstrations are resolved in the public displays to go to bolster diplomacy and what the Roosevelt administration did a couple of Big Moose one of them was to reactivate general Douglas MacArthur US general who was acting is field Marshall the Philippine military I think it's a reactivating in the Philippines and let him sort of publicly start consolidating and preparing just in case any message to Japan the other thing that was to demonstrate resolved and all that kind of stuff the Roosevelt administration did was they took the Pacific u.s. Pacific Fleet which is normally based on the west coast of the United States and moved it to Hawaii what is still a 6-hour Jet Plane ride towards Asia from the u.s. West Coast bass didn't Pearl Harbor but you know one man's intimidation move could be another man's opportunity but it takes a person who's almost a little bit crazy to see it that way sometimes that's what creative Geniuses are sometimes it just requires somebody willing to gamble farther than most people are willing to go enter Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto into the story with the names familiar he's famous and he's famous for both being a creative military genius and a crazy gambler you met him in person you probably would not be very intimidated he stood about 5 foot 3 maybe 5 foot 4 was missing several major fingers from one hand and walk with a limp because an entire chunk of his leg been torn off along with those fingers by the way in probably the most famous naval battle in all Japanese history the 1905 Battle of tsushima where the improbable almost near impossible happened when an Asian Fleet defeated a European Fleet and I mean ReSound Emily the as we had talked about earlier Japanese Fleet destroyed the Russian Fleet and Yamamoto was there as a young officer and badly wounded and almost lost his life that is one of the battles that will often be cited as an inspiration for Yamamoto has idea here and idea that is so crazy and improbable in so much of a gamble that when he presents it to the other Admirals you know on the big decision board they reject it and it's a sign of how brilliant he was and this was recognized by his peers that when he threatened to resign if they rejected it they change their minds they rather accept an idea they thought was crazy then Lose the person who came up with it because they acknowledge what a creative military genius he is he didn't develop these plans by the way alone he had spent more than a year working with other notable people that are famous in this story but my favorite one of them is a one historian described him as he's a military guy though but he's a Gandhi like figure who chain smokes and leaves Trails of Ashes behind him seems like a you know a Einstein Archimedes Sheldon Cooper kind of figure doesn't bathe apparently or doesn't bathe very often locks himself in completely dark in the rooms naked for inspiration in them and it comes writes things down really quickly in a piece of any he's this fascinating like wild character who can come up with an idea that is so crazy that the other side definitely doesn't see it coming and is so unusual and unexpected that I find it hard to even blame them for not seeing it coming up I said about the 9/11 attacks before that even though there were warnings just seemed so improbable and seems so dwarfed by other potential bad things that you're also getting warnings about that seem much more likely that it's only with hindsight that you look back and go. Why weren't we more Vigilant why do we see this coming who would have seen a surprise attack on US territory that was coming from a power that was four thousand miles away remember this is an era before cruise missiles before even airplanes that could get you know without a refueling stop from Japan to a place like Hawaii or they could all the way I can get to the West Coast certainly couldn't go round trip so if you're in a place like a y e how afraid are you that the Japanese are going to strike you especially since you know you don't even have a war and the answer is not very afraid Yamamoto and friends are going to come up with an idea to win a war that he doesn't believe is winnable that's an interesting thing to task somebody with a boob Yamamoto like a lot of these Japanese leaders especially the Navy Yamamoto went to Harvard for a little while and he has a famous line about you until you see in the factories of Detroit are the oil fields of Texas you know you don't know what you're talkin about what you want to make war against the country like the Uso famously is let's just call him extremely realistic like a lot of guys in the Navy which is part of the reason the Navy was more against fighting the anglo-americans cuz it'll be said earlier they understand they're going to be doing most of the fighting historian area Delta has him talking to another Admiral and basically predicting the way the wars going to go Yamamoto tells Admiral negano quote if I might add it is evident that the US Japanese war is bound to be protracted the United States will not give up fighting as long as Japan has the upper hand the war will last for several years in the meantime Japan's resources will be depleted battleships and weaponry will be damaged replenishing materials will be impossible Japan will be impoverished he then famously conclude the quote a war with so little chance of success should not be fought and quote but it was his job nonetheless to come up with a way to do it the plan has been a man there's a lot of accounts in Spanish some people being a say it's inspired by a famous Samurai battle a long time ago some people say the Battle of tsushima that Yamamoto was out of the inspiration others point to something much more recent in 1940 a British task force in the Mediterranean with a single aircraft carrier and British aircraft carrier to not carry a lot of airplanes by Pacific standards and their airplanes are very outdated by Pacific standards launched an attack against the Italian Fleet which was anchored in Port at night these outdated biplanes and they were I think between 20 and 30 of them over all but a minute times you had like six of them attacking did it a large amount of damage and put a bunch of these ships out of commission for quite a while the Japanese are there was a Japanese Envoy or adviser or attache in Berlin who I just came down to look at the effects at the harbor at Toronto the 1940 Battle of Toronto it's called and sent that back to Japan so all of these things were studied in by January 1941 Yamamoto has got a like mock-up of Pearl Harbor in an out-of-the-way place and he's got people sort of just planning for this and he's wargaming it and the challenges by the way our immense because the battlefield is immense this conflict which we fought in the Pacific but will instantly sucking all the Asian warfare that's been going on now for several years already this is a battlefield so large you could drop whole continents into it with a room all around the edges Logistics you know getting the stuff that the armies and navies need to fight and operate where they need to be in the quantities you need to have them is going to be the sort of challenge that overhangs every operation and will in large part determine the success or failure of them for this entire conflict that's the overriding in a military challenge in this theater distance and it get an idea of the kind of distance were talking about uniform comparison purposes at the same time where we are in the story in October November 1941 over in while I was going to say you're a butt it's almost in on the way to Asia outside the doors of Moscow the ver moch is fighting what they hope we're going to be these climactic battles with the Soviet Union's capital is going to fall but they're facing all sorts of logistical trouble right their supply lines are famously stretched to the Limit the Germans are now relearning the lessons you could have asked earlier conquerors about Napoleon could have explained the whole problem while he was trying to deal with supply issues when taking Moscow heck you could go back to Charles the twelfth of Sweden before Napoleon he could have told you the same story that when you get that far away from your base of operations it's hard to get the troops at the head of the snake you know as it's called what they need to fight in Berlin to Moscow is Like A Thousand Miles as the crow flies anyway lot longer when you go on those roads but for perspective Tokyo to a wahoo which is the first in a not to downplay anybody but in the first significant u.s. territory closest to Japan to Guam Alaskan Islands things like that by 4,000 miles away four times the distance from Berlin to Moscow so if they're having problems keeping the very much supplied it over by Moscow think about what it takes to to transport everything you need to keep an army put together across the Pacific this is part of the war plans that the Japanese have had now for more than a decade everyone knows right that major militaries have War plans in the back of their Dusty files that cover almost any eventuality you can think of I mean you got to do something when you're not doing anything else I'm coming up with a plan for the United States to fight candida the Canadians get all uppity well you know that's just covering all your base isn't by the way there was a plan like that I believe in 1940 in this case the Japanese plan for dealing with the United States involved the Philippines as sort of bait they were going to take the Philippines and then when the United States sent the fleet over two contested they were going to have a trap set this trap was going to be aided by the envisioned aircraft and submarines that we use Island bases farther out in the Pacific and they could sort of like gnats or mosquitoes weakening the us all along the way he don't have them in a condition not feeling so excited about fighting and then they walk into a trap if you look at the way the Japanese Navy is put together it's designed especially like they're newer unit is designed for this trap situation anyone who is a fan of the Japanese Navy in the second world war knows that it was constrained by treaties and other things and not allowed to be as big as the British Fleet or the US Fleet so what do you do if your the Japanese and you got those kind of constraints will they decided to go quality instead right if we can only have so many battleships let's make them really good battleships just as Wars about to break out of here the Japanese are finishing up the field Trials of the most powerful Battleship not just in the world the most powerful Battleship that will ever be built it's famous it's the Yamato the only other ship as powerful as the Yamato that will ever be built is it sister ship to Musashi that's only a little bit behind the Yamato and then behind that is another one called the shin I know all of these ships will outrange their American counterparts they have an unbelievable amount of armor they are enormous their guns are 18.1 in the nearest Naval competitor with 16-inch guns and 18.1 inch gun just so you know and the Yamato has nine of them can fire for a car in terms of weight 26 miles tell me no shells landed the destruction was enormous the best battleships of Germany the Bismarck and tirpitz the best battleships of the United States in the Iowa-class Missouri type battleships you write down the specs for them side-by-side with the Yamato class and there's no comparison these super battleships is there often termed we're going to be the major hammers that would come down on the American Fleet that's across the Pacific in a weakened by submarines and aircraft the entire way across and during the Ambush this is how they were going to be destroyed Candice existing long-term Japanese war plan then what's interesting is the plan from that point on once you gain this big advantage over the American Fleet is to hunker down and sort of wait for the Armistice remind you a little of how the russo-japanese war ended write the mistake in this thinking and it will be the mistake in the thinking in the second world war is what if the other side refuses to do the Armistice thing well Admiral Yamamoto is a typical aggressive Commander there very few commanders that like to allow the enemy to seize the initiative to choose the place of battle to attack at the time of their choice I mean these are all standard military things and Yamamoto has argument about the whole existing plan of this trap is what the Americans don't take the bait what are they don't come across the Pacific when you want them to what they stay home and build up their Fleet which they're doing all ready to let super charge and then come over what if they go around your trap I mean it's a whole lot of really good arguments Yamamoto is proposing something different this is the audaciousness that we spoke about earlier this gambler but at the same time somebody who's a Visionary a Visionary is someone who sees something ahead of the crowd Yamamoto sees what there are other Visionaries who also see by the way the potential of aircraft carriers now we in the modern world have a hard time not seeing the potential of aircraft carriers day of the capital ships of our era and having one or not having one suit of differentiates first-class Navy's from other class Navy's but remember it's going to be the second world war where these lessons are learned we should also point out there for the first more than two years of the war there's only one power that's really using aircraft carriers in combat so they're the only ones really learning a developing these techniques and that's the British by the way the Germans and the Italians their principal opponents during the two years before the Japanese the Americans are in the war they don't have any aircraft carriers which means the British don't have to get into this technological race where they have to respond to the Innovations of the other side and carrier Warfare cuz the other side doesn't have any carriers and the British being the quintessential Battleship Navy they see the use of these carriers as something that increases it's a force multiplier for their Naval task forces normally they put a carrier with a naval task force and then all of a sudden it has Ariel capability which is of course awesome you can scout way ahead now the range of visibility now these ships is increased once they spot an enemy Naval unit they can harass it and attack it and hopefully maybe you could cripple it or slow it down so that when the rest of the fleet catches them they can destroy the naval units of the enemy with Naval gunfire and Torpedoes which by the way can be aided by spotting from the airplanes to you so that it's this role where they are something that fits into British Naval Doctrine pretty well the attack at Toronto by the way is one of those areas where the Fleet air arm is it's called becomes extra useful because the rest of the Navy can't reach the Italian Fleet and do damage with Naval gunfire so what the heck you know it's a low-risk venture send them in there and see what happens and everybody was astonished by how well the results turned out now a guy like Yamamoto is one of those people that allows you to jump several steps in the normal linear technological development instead of the normal in this is pretty typical in military circles you don't want to take too many chances if you're doing one thing different than the last time they tried that's considered Innovation a guy like Yamamoto allows you to skip several steps here cuz he looks at the Toronto situation basically says if they can do that with one carrier and 20 to 30 outmoded by planes What If instead of one can you had something like six aircraft carriers and what if instead of 20 or 30 outmoded by planes you had more than 400 of the most modern technologically sophisticated aerial attack monoplanes also attacking by the way another Fleet tied up in Port Yamamoto doesn't see aircraft carriers as something that aids the Strikeforce Yamamoto sees them as the Strikeforce and instead of the naval gunfire being the set up to destroy the enemy ships which was part of the old Japanese trap plan to wasn't it he sees the planes from the carriers themselves is sinking the enemy ships it's hard not to see that is completely obvious with our modern mentality but not only is this a revolutionary and controversial idea without the data to really back it up think of what a gamble it is and Yamamoto said something at one point I get this plan fails we just need to give up well that shows you how much of a gamble it is and watching this whole thing take place is like watching a guy play a card game where the odds of winning are low and he's been his family's lives on the outcome in a lot of situations where you see big or dacious Gamble's of the sort Yamamoto has working with here it's because people are in relatively hopeless situations and it's better to take a chance because what's going to happen if you don't is worse in the case of like cities that are under siege armies that are surrounded in or you just going to die anyway so why not try a gamble here what have you got to lose in the case of Yamamoto the Japanese government in the Japanese nation-state they have a lot to lose their people are for the most part speaking right now on a relative Curve Your crystal ball would make clear if you could see five years in the future are safe relatively prosperous you want to talk about worst-case scenarios here it's not what the American sanctions could do to you if it's not with the anglo-american demands that you retract your Empire could do. It's worth losing in this metaphorical card game that Yamamoto is playing could do to you does he's betting with the lives of his people let's be honest he's betting his City's is the way it's going to work out so what does he have to do to win well this offensive attack against the US Fleet in Yamamoto has cases designed to do the same thing that the old trap is designed to do as we said get the fleet out of the way. We got to be out of the way for so that your pan could take over a huge chunk of Asia and the Pacific and then hunker down and beat off any efforts by the anglo-americans to win it back and within this core surrounded by a defense perimeter that is in on the largest Battlefield in human history would be the resources that Japan needs for self-sufficiency so you grab the resources you need to continue being a first-class power to continue to support your war effort you create a huge perimeter a long distance around that is defended and then you make the cost of taking it back higher than you think the other side is willing to pay this is where the Rose Colored Glasses start coming into things and according to write Cebu wrote yonaga he points out that in all the estimations that the military government have to come up with your all the numbers that you're plugging in for the unknowable is the x's and the wise are all sort of Rose Colored Glasses best-case scenarios how do you beat the anglo-americans will you take over all this territory and then the Yamato Spirit of the Japanese warrior will Outlast the soft westerners and they won't be willing to pay the price that you have to take to do this so they will negotiate and we will have some sort of an Armistice and Japan will come out ahead especially if you demoralize the Americans by decimating there at the outset and get a advantage on the Pearl Harbor attack still going to come out of this Americans have a tendency to tunnel vision and I do this myself and forget that that is simply a means to an end the elimination of the American Fleet which is the goal of the Pearl Harbor attacks is merely meant to cover the Rising Sun of Japan going Supernova and acquiring this defense perimeter and the raw materials resources and oil with in it the scope of the plan for this is breathtaking and it's hot spot when I keep running out of words to use audacity is the one I keep coming back to remember this is a country that is tied down heavily already on the Asian mainland but here's what historian Ronald H Spector describes as the plans here they're going to all kind of take place starting at the same time he writes quote the Japanese plan to seize and occupy a vast area including all of Southeast Asia they did not already hold Burma Siam Malaya the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies Japan would occupy the American Island outposts of Guam and wake she would also destroy or at least neutralize the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on the first day of the war the Philippines Himalaya were to be hit by air attacks followed soon after by Invasion simultaneously he writes troops would occupy British Borneo and Hong Kong once the Philippines and the Malay Peninsula with it's important Fortress of Singapore have been taken the conquest of Burma and the Dutch East Indies would follow and quote now you can't hide preparations for operations on that scale and the British and the Americans figure out the something big is happening they see troop ships moving they hear things in the codes that they broke in there seeing the redeployment of forces it's a big thing and it takes months and months and they catch on to it ironically though it's sort of a trackretention in a way that diverts their attention from what's going on in the very northernmost islands of Japan which was stretch up towards Siberia and really Frozen the foggy and rainy conditions that just sort of hide big warships by the latter part of November the Japanese of quietly and masked the most powerful aircraft carrier Strike Force in world history up until that time in these Northern Harbor is 6 aircraft carriers together couple of battlecruisers bunch of oil tankers for resupplies destroyers and support ships shrouded in the fog and Mist up there in the north not coincidentally right around the same time that that time limit expiring on the diplomacy has to work soon or else timetable December 1st it's or else time and in a famous meeting the Japanese emperor in what some historians refer to as a meaningless ceremony to confirm something already done others refused the event with some decision-making power none the less it's the official at the Japanese were going to have an official public declaration of war this would have been it but it's not public and nobody knows about it if you're not in on it but this is where the decisions made signed off on and by the time that happens that Fleet that have been so to hiding in The Mists in the northern Harbours with the 6 carriers has already departed dentist out to sea and his disappearing in the fog Banks of a northern route which avoids normal shipping lanes and at this point interesting ly enough American intelligence which monitors were all the Japanese big ships are found this fascinating before the second world war they already generally know the locations of the carriers in the battleships and all that Co traffic they lose sight of them which leads to a famous Pearl Harbor related quote with one of the Admirals on the island don't you mean the Japanese Fleet could be around Diamond Head right now and we wouldn't even know it the Americans knew war was coming so did the British in fact there is no anticipation in terms of will it or won't it happen in the couple of weeks before it does the question is what's going to happen when it breaks out the Americans are pretty darn sure you're going to see moves to take over those resources we talked about that the Japanese going to strike and Southeast Asia maybe the Dutch East Indies probably the Philippines what they don't see coming is an attack across 4000 miles of ocean at them it is very good book on Pearl Harbor called Pearl Harbor from infamy to Greatness author Craig Nelson quotes some of the wonderful pieces of dialogue that were extracted after the fact that look either prophetic or in a show some sort of vulnerability that was exploited by the surprise attack and in one of these conversations he has the various Admirals the military leaders in Hawaii right this is late November talking about sending planes to some of these islands that they're worried about the Japanese hitting and the Air Force Commander on Hawaii basically says don't send her away we have to defend Hawaii which kind of stuns Admiral Kimmel who basically says are you worried about Hawaii Nelson rights quote the Hawaiian Air Forces Chief of Staff James Mollison return to shorts original point and he saying now our mission is to protect a wahoo and shipping out those Army planes will lessen our capability to do so Kimmel wanted details on his thinking why are you so worried about this do you think we are in danger of attack when Mollison replied the Japanese have such a capability the Admiral argued capability yes but possibility the author continues quote Kimmel been asked his naval war plans officer rear Admiral Charles McMorris what do you think about the prospects of a Japanese Air Attack McMorris said none absolutely none and quote so it doesn't matter how often the American ministration gets a warning that Osama Bin Laden is bent on attacking the United States and is in a rumored to be thinking about using airplanes to run into buildings it doesn't seem real amongst all the other information that's out there until it happens and then after happens you can go back and pick out those points and they stand out like sore thumbs just like that in a do you mean to say they could be rounding Diamond Head right now well here's what we know they don't have to round diamond head because that strike force that is indeed approaching Northern Area north of Hawaii has aircraft carriers that can launch planes without ever getting that close to the Hawaiian islands and on the morning of December 7th early they begin to do that by this time in the plans unfolding the attack on Pearl Harbor you would have to say that they had been very fortunate some of the war gaming that they had done prepping for this event that had the United States discover them on the way in the Japanese Fleet having to fight its way within range of Hawaii to make its attack but they managed to get 220 miles north of a walk without being detected Des Plaines start launching in a really rough Sea by the way at 5:50 a.m. by like 6:15 6:20 they got the first wave up in the sky and that's a lot of aircraft by the way and the efficiency is going to be notably Japanese disperse way by the way consists of 43 fighter planes 49 high-level bombers 51 dive bombers and 40 torpedo planes at 6:20 it heads towards Oahu the Japanese begin bringing up the next way to go follow up and this gamble this huge audacious plan by Admiral Yamamoto and Company is underway ironically the commander of this operation a guy named nagumo not an audacious guy much more so conservative commander who doesn't seem like he's got a whole lot of faith in this planet's interesting that you'd have that the creative thinker who's really the Visionary come up with the idea then put the implementation of it into the hands of somebody much less likely to will follow up in an aggressive way because it's not his nature but none the less those planes got off with braids efficiency in when they're on their way to Hawaii Hawaii is sleeping there's a reason why the most famous books ever written about the Pearl Harbor attacks was called at dawn we slept because not only is Hawaii sleeping it's Sunday morning everybody sort of rousing a little bit late but it's a peaceful Island and I don't just mean in an environmental sense I mean in a diplomatic one as these aircraft are approaching what's going to be there attack targets the country they're going to attack isn't at war with them and there's a lot of controversy that has a reason ever since about whether it was supposed to be there seems little to no doubt that the attacks against British possessions in Asia or to be carried on without warning those were to be surprise attacks whether or not that was supposed to be the same situation against the us there are different points of view and I'm not qualified to pick among them for a long time the official Japanese point of view from their historians basically said it was a screw-up on the part of their diplomatic people in Washington DC you didn't get the material to the right place at the right time and because of that what should have been there early enough to be so Dove advanced warning didn't happen that way there's some Japanese writer couple years ago that is part of a minority school that suggests that that's all the covered it was always intended to be you know I'm officially late by accident right wink wink I kind of like author Craig Nelson I ain't is Pearl Harbor book because it it really does sound like what probably happened which was there there was going to be a very short window right here is a declaration of war 5 minutes later boom bomb drop actually 30 minutes later seems to be about what they were after he writes quote on by the way plan zeny's the plan to attack Pearl Harbor quote from the beginning Imperial Japanese army officers plan to invade Singapore without giving prior notice to Britain but the Imperial Japanese Navy felt very differently about the United States and operations e after the Imperial conference on December 1st in fact the emperor told prime minister Hideki Tojo repeatedly that he was not to attack the United States without warning Naval attache yuzuru sahi Matsu explained the sense of Honor that was a Hallmark of Japanese military history this is this officer explaining now quote Japanese warriors never try to assassinate a person who is sleeping when they tried to kill him they first kicked the pillow and woke him up and then killed him the same principle apply to the attack the required time to wake America up would be approximately 30 minutes and quote now what Nelson says that really makes sense is that that's a really fine line to walk 3 minutes it doesn't allow for any kind of Scrubs at all and there's a bunch of things that have to happen and go well and it didn't regardless of which point of view you would hear to it's clear that the people in Hawaii didn't know this was coming and the American people didn't know this was coming in because of that their wrath for this entire war will be visceral mean if it is interesting in one historian I read did this he said he shouldn't be interesting to imagine how different the mood might have been at the Japanese one day ahead of time we're at War and instruct interesting to speculate isn't it at the same time though if it's a minor miracle that the Japanese can get a strike force this close to Hawaii in peacetime how much of a major Miracle would they have needed to pull off the same thing in Wartime you can make a case that Yamamoto has plan really requires in order to be successful the kind of surprised that you only get in a diplomatic situation where War hasn't broken out yet you might need that for this plan to work and remember these Stakes involved here are enormous so I always try to imagine what they must have felt like in Tokyo the leadership the emperor all those people who know that this is about to happen you know looking at their watch wondering what's happening at this very moment to the leadership with the Strikeforce nagumo and his staff I think they're on the ikagi the aircraft carrier to the leadership of the first wave Strike Force itself it's led by a guy named forsheda by the way and he's been involved in the planning for this for a long time he's fully aware of the stakes he understands that what Yamamoto said is true which is if this attack doesn't do what we needed to do we might have to give up the war and he understands what breaks they have to get to have a chance of the attack working the first break he needs a surprise we have to achieve the surprise that we're after there are a couple of famous things that happened on the morning of December 7th that could have blown the surprise out of the water and ruin the whole thing they famously didn't there much investigated as you might imagine the events in after the war cuz they're seeing this failure isn't probably rightly so the first one was in the early morning hours like three 4 a.m. before the attack planes even take off midget submarines are discovered in Pearl Harbor these almost let's call them suicide missions cuz I thought they turned out to be several Japanese midget submarines were part of this operation a couple were discovered an alert was sent and destroyers are sort of agitated now and in the early morning hours there's activities stirred up in Pearl Harbor that wouldn't have been stirred up if those midget submarines have been part of the plant and Yamamoto was never for them by the way and then closer to the actual time of the attack as the more than a hundred planes are making their way towards a wahoo they're picked up on Hawaiian radar which is a a new thing in this. Had War already been declared it's hard to imagine that this would not have prompted a major response the fact that war isn't existing yet kind of helped things to go the Japanese way also the fact that Hawaii is like a giant aircraft carrier all by itself with planes incoming and outgoing all the time makes it easier for the radar operation people to rationalize the many many planes they all of a sudden see on their radar as something else for example to have some b-17s a big heavy bombers do in easy to confuse them with that maybe in hindsight it should have been seen for what it was but it wasn't and that makes the Japanese chances at Pearl Harbor at least now possible at about 7:40 a.m. the first wave of the Japanese attack planes break through the clouds over a wahoo they see Pearl Harbor and they don't see any anti-aircraft fire anything like that they don't see much activity it's obvious that they have not been discovered in the surprise has been achieved what they don't see this is the first piece of bad luck in the first bad break at the Japanese got any aircraft carriers and a scout planted zoomed by here 10 15 20 minutes previously didn't see them either and no other Navy on the planet would have understood the potential value of an aircraft carrier more than this one obviously they probably would have traded a Battleship Gray aircraft carrier in terms of what they would have rather sunk but while they may not have any aircraft carriers they have a bunch of battleships just sitting there I appreciate it types out on his signal device the famous all of the some controversy about this now about whether it was meant the way it sounded and has been portrayed famously and it'll be Tora Tora Tora which means tiger tiger tiger and this is supposed to be the message not just to the fleet but it's picked up all the way miraculously the signal in Tokyo to telling everyone who's in the know that this is happening that surprise has been achieved I like the way it's described in at dawn we slept when you think about the the unbelievable amount of tension someone like oh I don't know Admiral nagumo with the strike force would have felt a conservative guy doesn't have much faith in this plan anyway but realizes as everyone does just like Yamamoto at said and I'm paraphrasing but at this plane doesn't work we'll have to end the war this is the gamble for everything in this is the call moment in the poker game here's a way author Gordon W praying describes it in at dawn we slept quote for Sirius radio was still clicking when the first wave broke into its component parts fushida swung around Barbers Point and sure beyond all possible doubt that they had indeed achieve maximum strategic surprise at 7:53 a.m. he's staying out Tora Tora Tora tiger tiger tiger the code Words which told the entire Japanese Navy that they had the Pacific Fleet unawares aboard the aircraft carrier akagi kusaka was not in the least ashamed of the tears which coursed down his windburn cheeks impassive Zen Buddhist though he was Admiral nagumo could not have other the word had life and honour depended on it incredibly miraculously they had brought off Yamamoto is madcap Venture with silent indistinct each man stretched out his hand to the other and in their eyes were all the words they could not speak and quote all these planes begin to split up into their component parts this is all well rehearse stuff everybody knows what they're supposed to do and many of these planes don't go anywhere near Pearl Harbor they go to airfields all over the island and they knock out not just the airfields with any planes that they find and unfortunately Americans were more concerned with sabotage during this period than something like this so they parked all the planes like wingtip to wingtip with just makes it easier to guard but makes them easy to shoot up in the air to so nagumo and the strike force of carriers the main worry that they have two hundred and some miles north of Hawaii is it they're going to get hit with a counter-attack the only things Hawaii can counter-attack them with our ships and planes so the Japanese attack takes both of those into account and there will be planes seen all over the island and in fact in an event Witness by tens of thousands of people in one way or another there are so many stories about what happens on this stay some of which are obviously misremembered an exaggerated but none of them are first-hand accounts of people who witnessed something they never forgot because it was the most momentous thing of their lives when they watch this attack unfold I myself have a friend whose father as a kid was working on a on a point that was higher up and a Japanese plane flew right past him and he in the pilot made eye contact there's a lot of stories like that by the way about seeing the gold teeth of the pilot or the pilot smiling or waving in fact as the planes approach Pearl Harbor one of the workers at Pearl Harbor says he waved to the Japanese pilot because the Japanese pilot was waving to him and in a remarkable coincidence that seems almost to Hollywood moviemaking styled we even true these Japanese attack planes swarm down on Pearl Harbor right is the flag raising ceremony that happens in the morning is happening and the bands like on the Nevada they've got the Nevada band and they're doing the Star Spangled Banner's like out of Apocalypse Now you have explosion starting with the bands playing on and by the way the Nevada band would finish the Star-Spangled Banner even though they were being strafed while they were doing it in the flag was full of bullet holes if you want to talk how unprepared people were for a war with Japan even after the bombs started falling American Sailors especially are looking at this and thinking it's just a screw up there was no US Air Force at this time there was an Army Air corps to Navy Air Corps and the Navy people are looking at this thinking some army guy really screwed up and put real bombs on these plans cuz they've been watching Army exercises for a long time and this just looks like a huge mistake although one of my favorite quotes that is in a lot of the history books is the one sailor who turns to his body even after the explosions have started and says quote this is the best goddamn drill the Army's ever put on and quote don't know soon enough it's not a drill and when you look at the timeline from this encounter you'll notice that right after it starts the torpedo planes are honing in on the vulnerable battleships that are on the outside of some of these pairs that make up what's called Battleship row if you look at an actual diagram you'll notice that not all the battleships are in pairs but several of them are the ones that are in pairs means that the that one ship is on sort of the Waterside and the other ship is on the dock side so the ship that's on the dark side is protected by the outside ship those outside ships are going to take the brunt of the Torpedoes and the Torpedoes are ship killers they got like 500 pounds of explosives they weigh over a thousand pounds there 17 or 18 ft long a single plane will carry a single torpedo slung under it the plane will fly low reload of the water sometimes below the level of the height of the ship their torpedoing drop the torpedo and then speed off these Torpedoes by the way have been specially designed for Pearl Harbor because normally they dive so deep when you drop them that they would just embed themselves in the mud of Harbor the problem is once again that the Japanese designers here don't know if they're going to work so the very last major gamble of the entire operation here is due the ship Killers working this hard work is if they don't you're screwed Facebook Target Pearl Harbor author Michael slackman describes the opening of this attack and it's pretty clear that the Torpedoes work cycling rights quote as the attack began at 7:55 a.m. unbelieving Americans watched his bombs rain down on Hickam in Ford Island Airfield what a low-flying Kate's those airplanes release their Torpedoes against the ship's on Ford islands Westside Utah and old Battleship there was a Target ship now moored in the aircraft carrier Enterprises usual place and possibly be mistaken for a carrier by an inexperienced Japanese pilot took two Torpedoes another struck the cruiser Raleigh more in line ahead both ships began to list and the target ship capsized and 812 while Rollies Crusade the cruiser by heroic damage-control efforts on the opposite shore of Ford Island he writes Torpedoes truck Nevada Arizona West Virginia Oklahoma and California Tennessee Board in Board of West Virginia and Maryland in Board of Oklahoma escaped torpedo damage as did the fleet flagship Pennsylvania in drydock 1 and quote the Oklahoma's going to be hit with a couple of torpedoes right when the attack begins at 7:56 she's going to be hit with another one four minutes later that penetrates were the first two already blew up and she'll start to roll over to get hit with two more while she's rolling over and within 12 minutes of being struck you can see her Underside and men are scurrying as she tips over to try not to fall into the sea those are the lucky ones because at least 400 Sailors are trapped below decks in the Oklahoma with water pouring in shells giant shells are getting dislodged and crushing men and the lights are going out in these people are trying to get out before they drowned on the West Virginia their hit with something like six or seven Torpedoes a couple of bombs on top of that to boot and it's a nightmare over there one of the survivors described what it was like to be on the deck of one of these ships when it was hit by a torpedo and he says the torpedo throws up a mountain of water tons of liquid that goes up in the sky higher than the ship is tall but then crashes down on the deck slamming you and painting you and making it difficult because the ship's decks are Awash and water for a bit afterwards to get off a ship that's just been hit by a torpedo and you know is exploding and burning and all that kind of stuff making it even more difficult to deal with what amounts to most of these men on these ships with something more like a natural disaster or an explosion at Sea that might not have anything to do with war is very little of the combat side of this going on there are heroic Tales of men breaking into locked ammunition cabinets because everything is put away in the guns are some Thai is on these Plains for example still packed in the oil so this is more and intentionally cause disaster in the story of all these uman beings trying to make their way to safety all sorts of heroism by the way and let's give props where they're deserved a u.s. Navy that everyone noticed was behaving as well as you could possibly imagine under the circumstances there's not mass panic and screaming and yelling and people are even giving up their lives and dying in the Silence of resignation it's part of what makes everyone grit their teeth and get so angry about this afterwards if you're an American right I mean this is such bravery when you want to avenge people who died in such terrible circumstances as it is and make no mistake about it you look what's going to happen on the Arizona because after the torpedo planes are done income the high-altitude bombers the dive-bombers are striking the airfields all over the place the fighters and we haven't even talked about this are strafing all these ships with machine gun bullets in the zero Fighters also have to 20 mm cannons with your very nasty when I used to wargame second world war Naval battles we paid very little attention in the rules to the effects of strafing but it's clear from reading the Survivor accounts that it was massively effective in terms of sweeping the decks of human beings making it impossible to get stuff done creating chaos stopping people from getting off the ship store where they needed to go because what would happen is on these heavily-armored warships there still a bunch of stuff that's breakable and the bullets hit the ships creating tons of Sparks and a Ricochet everywhere and anything that's not nailed down or heavily armored goes flying the captain of I think the West Virginia will have his stomach torn out by some of the shrapnel and they will try to get him off the ship into safety he'll die trying and commanding the ship by the way and telling everybody not to not to bother with him another one of those many heroic stories out of Pearl Harbor Dee's Hangout to do bombers though come in at eight thousand fourteen thousand feet somewhere in there and these are not the best plan to attack ships with by the way it is very hard to hit a ship from that altitude obviously these are not moving ships of that helps and on Battleship row where you have the ships moored side-by-side next to each other it's almost like you've doubled the width of the ship so it makes it any easier Target none the less they hit ratio is nothing to be necessarily excited about but when one of these bombs from these high altitude bombers and some of them are converted 16 inch Naval shells by the way when one of them does hit the amount of damage is overwhelming and one of them hits the Arizona and once again this is all happening very quickly when the Arizona gets hit this shell it is assumed it's difficult to conduct any sort of realistic Recreation of the wounds to the Arizona because she's so damaged but it's thought that this thing some people used to think it went down the smokestack but it's thought that it it goes into the deck of the ship and penetrates and ignites the forward magazines where they keep all of the shells and ammunition and explosives Michael slackman says the Arizona's magazines contained 308 14 inch shells those are enormous and extremely heavy by the way 3500 5in round those are standard land artillery size pieces right there nearly 5,000 cans of powder and more than 100,000 rounds of machine gun and Small Arms ammunition when that ignites survivors and there aren't many but the people on the ships all around the harbor saw it say it was less of a big boom more a mighty whoosh they said another person describing slackman spoke said it was an awful swish soda sound he quotes semen artist tear who saw the Arizona he says explode while he was on the nearby Nevada and says quote the ship he said seemed to jump at least 15 or 20 feet upward in the water and sort of break into and quote the explosion was so large that it blew out the flames on the ship next to the Arizona which was burning like a concussion would blow out a match car engines on Ford Island stall from the concussion did not everyone flat on some of the surrounding ships and the bomber that released the bomb felt the concussion shake the aircraft the amount of debris that shower down on the ships next to the Arizona to Tennessee's right by it and gets hit with so much debris including body parts that It suffers more damage one author said from that then from the bombs that actually struck her the fuel oil that instantly goes out everywhere and all of these ships are gassed up and they carry hundreds of thousands close to half a million gallons of oil on them some of the more than happened in gallons of oil and this stuff is heavy oil and it's it's instantly all in the water so it's survivors jump in to try to escape the devastation in some places this is 6 in thick of oil in the water the aftermath of the Arizona explosion amid all this other destruction going on simultaneously is described by many may be the most visceral account I've read is Craig Nelson's he starts by quoting a West Virginia sailor who described the scene quote ships on fire ships burning explosions going on all over the place I saw the Arizona blow up and she just rained Sailors and of course those were the ones that were fortunate enough to live the ones that were blown off the ship Nelson continues quote burning Arizona crewman ran after into the water thinking they would find relief instead they found 6-inch pools of fiery fuel oil covering the sea turning them into matchsticks Clint Westbrook said quote all the oil tanks on all the battlewagons have been ruptured most of them and you could just about almost get out and walk on it it was that thick and around those ships that have fire it was on fire as well so a lot of these people jumping off the ships were jumping right into burning oil we had just loaded the day before cuz we were going back to the States for Christmas The Admiral had told us so we had filled the tank Saturday and quote Nelson quotes another witness who said quote these people were zombies they were burned completely white their skin was just as white as if you would taking a bucket of whitewash and painted it white their hair was burned off their eyebrows were burned off the pitiful remains of their uniforms in their crotch was a charred Remnant and the insoles of their shoes was about the only thing that was left on these bodies they were moving like robots their arms were out held away from their bodies and they were stumping along the decks and quote. Quote another sailor who said that the decks looked like a Boneyard from all the body parts author Walter Lord in day of infamy describes the remembrances of a Tennessee Survivor who explain what it's like to look up and see a bomb coming down right at you and then what happens afterwards hero quote semen JP Burkholder look out a porthole on the bridge just as one of the converted 16in shells crash down on number 2 turret a few feet forward the porthole cover tore loose clobbered him on the head and sent him scurrying through the door outside he helped a wounded Ensign but couldn't help one of his closest friends it was so far gone he only wanted Burkholder to shoot him another armor-piercing bomber through number 3 turret farther aft semen SF Bowen station there was a powder Carmen was just doggin the hatch when the bomb hit it wasn't a shattering crash at all just a ball of fire about the size of a basketball appeared overhead and seemed to melt down on everyone it seemed to run down on his skin and there was no way to stop it as he crawled down to the deck below he noticed that his shoe strings were still on fire and quote the tragedy is immeasurably made worse when the fuel oil that all these Sailors struggling in the water against catches fire the combination of sailors being stuck underwater and sailor is burning is about as nasty as you can get them in there are reports of sailors jumping off the Arizona and sizzling when they hit the water and then of course the water catches on fire it's a nightmare is that worse than the people that are trapped below decks in the many many stories of trying to escape the water is climbs up and he's little pockets of air and people will be cut out of these things for weeks afterwards the very belt armor that is supposed to make these ships a protective place for their Crews making it harder to cut into there will also be people that don't get cut out of the ships in time and are found later sometimes much later dead entombed in their ships with calendars often marking each day that they were often in total darkness trapped under there to give you an idea of the speed of these attacks the bigwigs in the military on the island can kind of see the smoke they have these wonderful home sometimes even overlooking the area around Pearl Harbor General Walter short sees this Admiral husband Kimmel sees this and get a chance to watch some of this unfold as it happens there's a famous story General shorts he's the smoke while he's having Sunday breakfast with his wife runs to his Center to ask what's going on I asked Lieutenant Colonel George Bicknell what's going on out there and Big Moe says I'm not sure General but I just saw two battleships sunk and then short screams that's ridiculous Admiral Kimmel is having a similar experience and you'll get blamed for a lot of this after the war didn't put out the torpedo nets all kinds of veggies the one that asked his associate know what the probability of a Japanese Air Attack was that the guy said not absolutely none and now he's watching in disbelief in real time you know what's going on out there and it's it's almost heartbreaking unless of course you know you blame him for the whole thing author Craig Nelson in Pearl Harbor from infamy to Greatness rights quote an officer found Admiral husband Kimmel at home with the news the Japanese planes were attacking his Fleet the Admiral was still buttoning his white uniform as he ran out of the house and onto the neighbor in the lawn of the district's Chief of Staff Captain John early which had a panoramic view of Battleship row mrs. early said later that Kimmel stood quote in utter disbelief and completely stunned his face as white as that uniform he wore and quote now coating Kimmel quote the sky was full of the enemy Kimmel said later he saw the Arizona quote lift out of the water then sink back down way down and quote miserly he writes saw a battleship capsized and said looks like they got the Oklahoma yes I can see that they have the Admiral ghormley responded Nelson rights other people encountered Kimmel right around the same time Kimmel and his associates send a message to the Pacific Fleet and back to Washington Sailing Marina Pearl Harbor is under attack he orders that the enemy force be found and then one officer Remembered in is quoted by Nelson as saying quote I ran over to my offices and I happen to be standing alongside the commander-in-chief himself Admiral Kimmel we were glumly watching the Havoc the Carnage that was going on and suddenly he reached up and tore off his 4-star shoulder boards which indicated his Rank and title as commander-in-chief Pacific Fleet he stepped into his adjacent offices and realizing he was going to lose command Dawn 2 Star rear Admiral shoulder boards and quote and then Nelson relates his version of a famous story that's told a number of different ways but right around that exact moment a bullet ricochets into the house if they spent 50 caliber shell is what I read somewhere which would probably indicate that it was an American bullet but it was so spent that hit him in the chest and just bounced off and left a mark on his white uniform and he's go to the saying several things are Nelson has him saying I wish it had killed me but the variations are such that it's sort of a rueful dark joke that that would have been better than what he's going to face now being responsible for this immense Carnage that is visible to him a car needs that is described over and over and it's unbelievable that some of these people will come up from below decks on these ships that have settled into the mud of Pearl Harbor if they had been sunk by the way out at Sea they would have been lost forever but a bunch of these ships just so to settle their heroic efforts by the cruise to counterflow didn't save them but there's a lot of people trapped below them and when they come up and they look around remember the world that they last saw at blue skies and this marvelous glorious us Pacific Fleet and they come up in the water and there's bodies floating everywhere the ships are all falling apart and smoking in them and you can't even see the sky through all the black smoke is the oil burns off the ocean their world has been transformed they've gone from a Pacific Paradise to a naval version of Dante's Inferno in a matter of minutes and all of this Carnage and all this damage and all this Destruction has been rocked by the first Japanese attack wave remember there's another attack wave not that far behind them and not long after the first wave departs the second one swoops in a couple of ships heroically a couple of Destroyers the battleship Nevada heroically a managed Against All Odds to start moving making it look like you know we're back already and we were already 30 minutes 35 minutes 45 minutes after a surprise attack the American Fleet on the move and it was inspirational to all who could see if those ships attracted these specific attention of the second wave who goes after them with bigger than a bad walk to be beached in the sand to keep from sinking within 90 minutes it's all over from start to finish the planes fly off and Pearl Harbor is left a smoking Devastation with dead and wounded everywhere more than 2,400 people died in this 90 minutes more than $1,000 wounded almost 200 planes were destroyed on the ground more than a hundred and fifty are damaged and the entire Battleship complement of the US Pacific Fleet is rendered useless for ship sunk the others burning and damaged the Japanese lose less than 30 planes there's no possible way if you are on the Japanese side to look at this and not see this as a huge Victory when you measure it you know from a cost-benefit standpoint right less than 30 points did all that damage although there were Japanese at the time who noticed you know a silver lining from the Americans view point anyway and that's that the battleships may have been destroyed to put out of commission but the carriers of the US Pacific Fleet which had been at Pearl Harbor not that long ago weren't there when the attack happened and that means that the weapon system that few Only The Visionaries at seen as the next big thing and Naval Warfare that means the right after the battle that just proved conclusively that aircraft carriers were the next big thing in Naval Warfare didn't get any of the enemy's aircraft carriers in the United States is carrier is that I need to be away from Pearl Harbor on December 7th will be instrumental in avenging what was done there knocking out the battleship component of the Pacific Fleet is a big blow the human lines are irreplaceable but let's be honest these battleships were not even cutting-edge battleships most of them dated back to the first world war some of them are even older than that useful it a bunch of things surely but if you were someone like Winston Churchill the most useful thing these battleships maybe did in terms of helping win the war was exactly what they did do and he did not see the Pearl Harbor strike is a tragedy a better word might have been heroic a necessary sacrifice to get the United States to do something that from his point of view they should have already done it's probably not accurate it's probably a misquote but one of the lines attributed to Winston Churchill I was grew up hearing it was that you could always count on the Americans to do the right thing after all the other options have been exhausted in this case the attack on Pearl Harbor eliminated any other options get aroused a sleeping giant to a level of Wrath that would carry it forward through any misfortunes to an ending that a guy like Winston Churchill saw as inevitable the United States was shocked and saddened and emotionally upset by the Pearl Harbor attacks a guy like Winston Churchill was elated because to him December 7th 1941 was the day that the war was decided and Britain was going to be on The Winning Side after all he wrote after the war about his feelings at this moment and said quote no American will think it wrong of me if I Proclaim that to have the United States at our side was to me the greatest joy I could not foretell the course of events I do not pretend to have measured accurately the Marshall might of Japan but now at this very moment I knew the United States was in the war up to the neck and into the death so we had one after all yes after Dunkirk after the fall of France after the horrible episode of a ran after the threat of invasion when apart from the air in the Navy we were almost unarmed people after the deadly struggle of the U-Boat wore the first battle of the Atlantic gained by a hands breath after 17 months of lonely fighting and 19 months of my own responsibility in Dyer stress we had won the war England would live Britain would live the Commonwealth of nations in the Empire would live how long the war would last or in what fashion it would end no man could tell nor did I at this moment care once again in our Long Island history we should emerge however Mulder mutilated safe and Victorious we should not be wiped out our history would not come to an end we might not even have to die as individuals Hitler's fate was sealed Mussolini's fate was sealed as for the Japanese they would be ground to powder and quote we've been telling you about audible on this program for a long time and there's a reason that you hear us discuss them as often as we do when it's because this is not a program that relies on Advertising we're listener-supported so we can afford to Simply do advertising that conforms to the hosts on radical beliefs on certain things for example reading I'm a voracious reader and I'm one of these weird people that thinks that we benefit from reading and that we all collectively as a society that the society benefits from having more readers and if you look at the strides over the amount of time we've been telling you about audible that audible is helped make reading something that fits into the modern world the digital age in the lives of of the next generation of Americans you see that this is an advancement that keeps reading relevant and the end result is in my radical view a better Society me take for example what audible does with their app I

History coming up all the Pearl Harbor attacks are going on pretty much simultaneously a Japanese Blitzkrieg is occurring in Asia and the Pacific the largest Battlefield in human history that will succeed in part because of the West's underestimation of Japanese capabilities and this is for all sorts of reasons including racial ones some of these Colonial powers do not believe and maybe a lot of Americans don't either. An Asian they would have said Oriental at the time people work capable of something like what the Japanese are about to pull off but there's a reason we called this series Supernova in the East and this is where we see the Japanese Rising Sun explode in conquered territories over a wide area in the United States angered roused but groggy is in no position to do anything about it right away for those of you who've been missing the combat element of this story and let's remember for a long time the histories of the story in the American history books started with Pearl Harbor were 8 hours into this series let the record show this in context but this is the part of combat operations that most Pacific War aficionados are familiar with and that's coming up along with all the other stuff of course all that and more as we like to say in part 3 of supernova in the East due out in about 10 years given our current schedule but we try thanks for all the support
