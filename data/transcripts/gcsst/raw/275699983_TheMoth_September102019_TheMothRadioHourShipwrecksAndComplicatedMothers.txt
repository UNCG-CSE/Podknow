Of his party and being 8 years old and not knowing really what she was asking me to do like I said fine I will and I did but at some point during the evening the adult started giving me champagne being a show this crowd it was a place where it was sort of cute to see a sort of Tipsy eight year old running around the house and I slept and I called her mom and she snatched me and dragged me into the bathroom and really her face was so contorted with I thought then was anger but what I now know was fear and she said don't you ever call me Mommy in front of people like this don't ever call me Mommy in front of Larry's family he'll be they will disown him and will lose everything and I hung my head not knowing quite what I had done and I said yes on Norma I won't and I went back to Atlantic City and I told on Peggy and Uncle Paul about this and they were horrified and then several months later when Mom called to say that she was going to become mrs. Larry storage that her dream was finally going to be fulfilled I was elated as she was I was jumping all around the house oh I'm going to be the child of daughter of a star and we hung up the phone and on Peggy pulled me aside and said not so fast you need to make sure that you never tell anybody that your mom is married to Larry Stewart if it's found out that that he's you know he's married to a woman that had a black child his entire career could go south they'll cancel the show that he's in all those ballet classes tap dance classes and swimming lessons and piano lessons in the summer camp that you love little all disappear she was trying to get me to understand the economic price of being black in this country which during the 60s was still pretty severe and frankly it still is in 1960 according to the census something like 25 there only 25 black millionaires in the United States of America which is an amazing thought to think about and so the money that she and all got to help raise me was really important in our family so I learned that I was just going to be black and I was fine with that by the time I had reached College I was blacker than now we got to the sixties you have to remember I'm growing up at the same time that the country is going through the Vietnam War crisis and the and African-Americans as a whole or sort of reaching the point where I'm sort of had it this is the. When Cassius Clay beat Sonny Liston and changed his name to Muhammad Ali it's the. When Stokely Carmichael invented the phrase Black Power I went to work with the Black Panther program serve breakfast in Atlantic City New Jersey I sold the papers as long as I'm Peggy would let me know she found out about that put the kibosh on that pretty fast and by the time I got to school I was sort of a really determined that I was going to live my life as a black woman there was a group on campus of multiracial students that was a multiracial I think they call themselves the multiracial students Harvard students Alliance or something like this and I refuse to join them because I didn't want to have anything to do with being multiracial if I was a multiracial I had I just live this entire painful existence that I've been growing up with and sure enough I chose my side and then in November of that year my freshman year my mother calls me she's been having her 50th birthday party she's decided to have it in Las Vegas now it's a card-carrying member of the Black Panther Party and then about socialist at the time going to Las Vegas with a counterrevolutionary Act I couldn't figure out what I was going to do but I'll pay you had raised me to always do what my parents told me to do so Mom was turning 50 and she wanted me to come to Las Vegas I was going to have to figure out a way to go to Las Vegas but I went to Las Vegas on my terms I had this big afro that was like you know bigger than Angela Davis has some of you remember the Roberta Flacks first album I had a leather miniskirt and my leather high-heeled boots and my fishnet stockings and I arrived at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas to a sea of white folks wearing chiffon and Indian and turquoise jewelry and I didn't want to have anything to do with them but there I was with my mom and with Larry she was wearing a Ralph Lauren original navy blue rayon long gown and a white feathered headdress looking gorgeous as she always did and she wanted to go see Johnny Cash for a 50th birthday what folks don't listen to country music and Atlantic City New Jersey so this really wasn't happening for me I was like Johnny Cash are you serious so we go to wish I had to go cuz she was going so we going we're sitting in the grand ballroom at Caesars Palace which I think at the time was the largest place I've ever been and it was just huge and Larry looks around at all of a sudden he sees the heavyweight champion of the world Muhammad Ali standing a few tables away and we get up when we go to meet Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali at that time he was still the heavyweight champ was still in shape he was the biggest man I have ever met huge just he was like it was like meeting the Berlin Wall sand out the shake mine and I felt like a six-year-old my hand just disappeared inside of his but as I looked around I'm saying he and I are probably the only black folks in the Grand Ballroom the Caesars Palace so I decided that I was going to rub them a little bit cuz I was so shy that was the only thing I can do is use laughter to try to get out of the situation so I said hey champ how come you and I are the only black people in here getting ready to listen to Johnny Cash and he says to me girl I'm from Louisville Kentucky where I'm coming from there's a whole lot of black people listen to country music on my my revolutionary my revolutionary fervor and I go and I sit down and I'm listening to Johnny Cash begins to play I'd never really listen to Johnny Cash I didn't realize the the degree of talent the degree of emotion that the man brought forth from the from an acoustic guitar in his voice and if he sang the song it was almost a trap reaction that has he sang the song I Walk the Line it felt like he was singing it to me I felt like he was describing my entire life I had grown up in a world where my friends were either black or white where my family was either black or white or I listen to music that was identified as music that black people listen to or is music that white people listen to I dress the way I thought black people should dress I talk the way I thought black people should talk but that night the champ and Johnny Cash taught me a lesson the lesson was that maybe I could balance myself on that razor and walk the line and have the people that I loved and the things that I like be on both sides in and not have to choose Thank you that was June cross a memoir and produced an autobiographical film about her dual identity but she told me that working on this moth story was one of the hardest thing she's done she said it was physically exhausting and she took naps in between story rehearsals she said in my book readings you have the safety of the written word to hide behind to tell if you actually have to come out from behind that shelter I keep bleeding because you're mine very very easy to be a pretty flower is produced by Atlantic public media in Woods Hole Massachusetts and presented by the public radio exchange PRX.

Hour from PRX I'm Sarah Austin jenness our next story is from Mishka shubaly he's a musician and after living out of a tour bus for a year playing with The Strokes Yeah Yeah Yeahs and The Decemberists Michigan showed up at the moth story slam he told the shorter version of The Story You're about to hear at a slam he didn't win but we developed it with him for me dearest Mishka shubaly live at the mall I was fast asleep when the disaster struck we hit with a deep tearing crash of such sustained violence I felt the entire boat shutter under me like a wounded animal I tried to jump out of my bong but the boat flipped over on its side threw me against the wall and then back into my bunk and then cabin filled with noise I can hear boards twisting and squealing against each other I can hear the boat grinding against the Rocks I could hear the crew yelling and shouting questions I thought I knew I had to find John Captain Peters 89 year old father and he wasn't in the bunk across from me and you wasn't on the floor so he had to be in the in the front bumper called his name twice and he didn't respond so I carefully climbed out of my bunk and move forward into the darkness deeper into the ruined boat spring of 2001 I just graduated college my friend Jacob Had Your Shot his final speedball and died on his kitchen floor and my drinking was spiraling out of control I I've been working with Jacob to try and keep them clean even as I was drinking in class or drink before class in the mornings you're just a medicinal amount to get rid of the shakes and the chills and sweats and then after we graduated we played phone tag and and lost touch you know he was trying to keep normal hours and I was staying up till 8 a.m. drinking and doing coke I I didn't have a cell phone at the time just a crappy pager and the day after he died my pager deliver to voicemail from the other side hey what's up man it's Jake just calling I'm just trying to catch up with you all right I'll talk to you soon I remember sitting at my kitchen table drinking straight from the bottle playing that message over and over again searching for a clue and explanation a reason I wanted to die but my mother had explicitly forbidden suicide so I jumped at the chance to crew on a a dangerous sailing trip from the Dominican Republic up to Florida I thought it was a good compromise went when I got to John's bunker a shaft of light came through one of the scupper-holes and I saw a tangle of Limbs like a pile of firewood and my heart dropped reached out and I grabbed something John I said yes Peter's father had slept through the entire thing several several equipment failures and navigation where in a storm have put us on the uninhabited point of an island in the Bahamas in the middle of the night we got everybody safely on sure but it was a bleak scene Captain Peters boat his life's work in his home in the last 20 years ruined on the rocks and the five of us stranded there with limited limited amount of water and nobody knew we were in trouble we shot off flares I radioed for help and then when nobody came we just got wasted on some red wine and passed out on the beach Peter woke me in the morning when the sun rose he had been there several years earlier and he knew Matthew town the islands loan settlement was a short 25 miles away so he was going to hike that 25 miles to go and get help I think I surprised both of us by saying that I would go hot guy on the captain the captain always stays with the ship it's my responsibility your responsibility is here with this ship I can't let you go dude whenever I say something serious I have to preface it with dude dude no offense but you're old and you are Parkinson's and you have a family of younger and faster I'm stronger and I'm Expendable I'm going I took my share of the water 1 gallon some peanuts and a couple of multivitamins to my mother had forced on me before I left if I'm not back by this time tomorrow send someone else the beach was littered with trash and right away I found a hard hat so I ripped up the rotting webbing out of it and put it on my head backwards to protect my head and my neck from the Sun t-shirt shorts and running shoes when the boat wrecked but they'd all gotten so so I was wearing a long sleeve white button-down my boxer shorts and the final humiliation socks and sandals ladies that the shoreline unfolding in a series of Deep Cove so I found myself covering twice the ground I wanted to and crawling through several mangrove swamps I decided it would just be easier to able to walk point to point it through the shallow water I knew I had to be careful cuz if I twisted an ankle or something they just be finding my bones years later we've been fishing off the back of the boat it seems like every other fish that we caught we lost a shark's you'd have something on the line and then all the sudden it would go slack and you pull up a huge fish head just gushing blood and you could tell from the bite radius that it wasn't a little shark but that was started seeing you know so so I took off my sandals and I took off my socks and then in less than two feet of water I want to say it was a 12-foot like maybe 12 ft it would probably closer to 7 feet but that's still a pretty fucking big shark to come up on when you're walking into the water that got it was dead just rocking with the motion of the waves but if it was dead then why couldn't I smell it so I took a rock and a chopped at the sharp thump the shark on the back of thrashed wildly and then headed out for deeper water so I decided to stick to the shore after that I took a couple multivitamins and a handful of peanuts to get over the hangover you know but it it it just made me thirsty or so I didn't need anything else after that and I am I mean I was already starting incredibly dehydrated and and even the whole thing off drinking until like my throat was parched and my lips were dry I was already like down to half of my water before I knew it and there was no place to stop and rest there was no shade you know I would just be cooked so I you know I kept going as my as my water diminished in my condition degraded I made I obsessed over these murky calculations I knew that each step I talk brought me closer to Matthew town and each step also used on some of my dwindling energy and brought me closer to zero now I knew I made significant progress because I've been walking for a while I didn't have a watch so I didn't know how long I know but either way my water was getting incredibly low and and I knew that regardless of what my destination was salvation or the other thing that I was getting closer as the as my son Stroh kicked in I laughed I sang I talk to myself I started to confuse Shadows with water so I would walk right walk wide around a puddle only 2 walkthrough Shadow that somehow got my feet wet and the noise I heard it was it was my my breath or it was the wind or the waves it was it was a woman's voice cooing in my ear it was several women laughing at me it was a crowd cheering for me or booing me it was a boat was an entire fleet of boats coming to my rescue I wanted to be test on this trip to see what I could do if I could do anything but I was ready for it to be over I approached is a point one of those endless coves and I willed Matthew town to appear on the other side you know crappy little gas station hostile locals understocked over price grocery store melting popsicles but when I come around the corner there was just Sand and Sea and mangroves and I fell on my face in the sand and I cried I was 24 years old and what I done with my life I calculated Lee drank as much as I could get away with that my job without getting fired I had sponge unconscionable amounts of coke off of friends and strangers I repeatedly cheated on my girlfriend I'd abandon my friend Jacob in his time of need it seemed like I had spent all my time either jerking off or hungover or jerking off while hungover and now I was going to die here alone on this sun bleach rock my life almost completely on lived I cried for the songs that that I written but not recorded and now people wouldn't remember before and I cried for all the fuckedupshit that I had done that now would be the only thing that people would remember me for I cried because I was never going to see my Mother's Hands again so sitting in the sand stirring up the sky I made one last desperate calculation the sun was directly overhead so worst case scenario I may be covered only 15 or 16 miles which meant I attend miles to go I had about a cup of water left and my body was shutting down now I run all those corny Macho survival books they say you can survive by drinking your own pee so I'd held it all day long but I knew I couldn't hold it for much longer so the Moment of Truth preserve my dignity and pee in the sand and lose all that moisture when I maybe had 10 miles to go or recycle it and maybe Live to Tell the fucked-up story it's funny you know it's only when you're facing death that your filthy truck stop bathroom of a life becomes so precious to you I thought about my friend Jacob and I thought about that last fix that he talked and you know I wondered if like did he know that something was going wrong did he see his death naked laid out in front of him like I saw mine and wasn't scared because I was scared shittless but I knew the people were counting on me I knew that Peter and John and the rest of the crew they were depending on me and I thought of the looks on their faces when they saw me on the decks of a Coast Guard Cutter going in to rescue them so I took off my construction helmet and I Unleashed a hot bladder full of brown multivitamin and Rich do urine I mean it's blowed like it was Radioactive wish shaking hands I lifted the helmet to my lips and I choke down as much of my own hot salty pee as I could stomach without puking and then took a couple of tiny desperate sips of the water that I had left just to wash the taste out of my mouth I don't know if you've ever tried to drink out of a punch bowl but it's not an entirely efficient process so it was like dribbling out of the corners of my mouth and like it was a horror show but you know after the wave of nausea passed I felt great 10 miles 20 miles 50 miles I didn't care I drink my pee I had what it took to survive and I was going to make it home less than five minutes later I was rescued a group of biologist or out banding Turtles and this is the last day of their study and because it was the 4th of July they almost didn't come out Peter's estimate had been wrong and I had walked 30 miles and I was still 25 Mi away from civilization so when they brought me to the Coast Guard Station I told the Coast Guard right away I said listen we got for American sailor Shipwrecked on the northernmost point of the island there's one of them is 89 and two of them require medication almost instantly I could hear a helicopter starting up and it sounded awesome just then A call came in from the Bohemian defense Patrol they had just picked up for Shipwrecked Sailors on the northernmost point of the island and they had sent one of their group off to go and get help and he's never been picked up and they wanted the Coast Guard to get a helicopter the dispatcher looked at gave me a funny look and spoken to His Radio I think we got them they got me a shower they gave me this t-shirt one guy made me a sandwich two slices of white Wonder Bread one piece of bologna one piece of American cheese yellow mustard and lots of mayonnaise it was the best sandwich I've ever tasted so it turned out that about an hour after after periods had sent me off you realized that the force of the impact had disconnected the antenna from the radio so he fix the radio radio for help. The Bohemian defense Patrol right away they been safe for hours so I got Shipwrecked I walked 30 miles in the blazing hot sun I drink my own pee and all I got was this lousy t-shirt in no way am I a hero I couldn't save Jacob and I didn't say Peter or John or the rest of the crew but I saved myself and I guess that's got to be enough that was Mishka shubaly Michigan used to tell parts of the story wherever he went one night he got into a cab and the driver said I know you Mishka said no I don't think so and the cabbie said yeah you got Shipwrecked you told me the story the last time you were in my cab we ask Mishka what it was like to craft the full story with the moth sing about the moth is that they're all true stories so the more you learn about how to tell a story in the more you learn about your own story The more you learn about yourself and your own experience and how you perceive the world and how you how you perceive your friends and your family and why you didn't forgive that person that you should have been you didn't punch out that guy that you should have been I mean it really sort of me in the for me the the moth experience made my my story explode in slow motion so I could see every little part of it here mishka's original slam story and see photos of the ship that wrecked visit our website the moth.org while you're there you can pitch a story of your own log onto the moth.org to record your pitch right on the web or you can call our catch hotline at 877-7991 at 877-799-6684 and you'll have about a minute to hook us when we come back a woman tells a story at Our Endless competition with her mother is produced by Atlantic public media in Woods Hole Massachusetts and presented by the public radio exchange PRX. Org radio hour from PRX I'm producing director of The Moth back in 2009 The Moth travel to Australia to produce a show for the purse International Arts Festival the 36-hour commute was well worth it and one of the local stories we found is up next here's Susan Duncan live at the mall I'm going to tell story about my mother it's very hard to stand up to your parents and it took me until I was about 49 to actually size of my mother will actually just had talked to her it was Christmas and she was staying with me as she stayed with me for the past 30 years at Christmas and I just had a breast removed and my love I had dumped me and I told her this can you about the breast but you never knew about the lover because he was sitting inappropriate and she don't your man she said women don't like me should I should and I was I didn't quite know what she meant for about 2 minutes and then when I realized what she meant I was so enraged I said this is the last time you'll be spending Christmas under my roof we got three Christmas I took a home to her home at the foot of the Blue Mountains and I returned to my home which was an idyllic little tin Shack on the edge of pit water where the only way home is by bars and it's on the back of the Korean guy Chase National Park a beautiful physical world a place for a Fieldpiece over the next 12 months of course I spoke to my mother with Christmas rolled around again and I couldn't quite them have for lunch but I banned it from the house should you not staying with me you can come but you know it's staying so I booked her into a hotel nearby Hotel just a little short boat Journey away she had lunch we got through that no blood on the walls pretty good and I went to pick her up on the fourth morning to take a home again to harm at the foot of the Blue Mountains and she was waiting for me in the for the hotel and she was beautifully dressed as she always is because she told me on my life she actually did look like Jane Halo as a young woman or she didn't really think Jean holler was particularly attractive but people said she look like her so she's supposed she had to accept that she look like Jane harder as I picked up a suitcase she had me a piece of paper and I opened it up and it was the bill there's an extra zero I looked at the list the optimization of everything and she cleaned out the mini bar every night for 3 nights how much whiskey can a woman drink and she looks emaciated medicinal and then she said will I be staying with you next year it'll be much cheaper and you know I love that about my mother I love that toughness that ruthlessness that desire always to have the last word Ann Arbor specters it means we don't get along that well but I respected but six months later she had a fall and then about six months later she had another full so she feels she broke her left wrist itchy bug broken right wrist and it was a moment that I realize that there are a whole lot of decisions that I would have to make my father is dead and my brother is dead and I realized in a strange way that this was probably the moment that my mother was going to stop becoming my child I had to work out a way to get her to have a look at a retirement village Christmas came I kidnapped her on the way home to the farm took her into this Retirement Village open up this door to this claiming one bedroom apartments flushing Creek during cost and I said what about this and it's the same woman who told me that she didn't want to move out of her and her ever because she knew where everything was did I want to be here in 2 weeks and it was so easy I panicked I thought my God she's going to be 10 minutes away so I went back home to my husband Bob and I think she's going to be 10 minutes away and he's a very wise man and he said Susan there's a moute between us and then he looked at me again and he look a bit more serious this time and he said she's not an Olympic swimmer or anything is she now I know we moved to rain we sit it out just so beautifully as though she was a new bride beginning a new life which is in fact what she wants then we went back to her house to clean it out to sell it for him and I started going through the cupboards and every time I opened a cupboard it was filled with magazines what I was working as a journalist I would ring my mother inside look this month I've got a cover story if you're interested and she would always say oh I don't think so the same stuff too expensive at the moment I don't think so and he was his house stacked with magazines all of them had my stories in them I just couldn't get my head around all this so when we finish with the house and we gone back Esther the house was filled with magazines oh my stories did you read my stories she said old people gave them to me people gave them to me cuz I saw your name in The Midnight how did you rate them how I don't know I can't remember because to give a compliment would I think I've killed her time out Stone it was Christmas again and I wrote A Memoir and I always tell people who are about to write Memoirs not to use them as a way to get back at people however my mother was a large part of my memoir but I would never hurt her I really wouldn't and the underlying basis of our relationship is love there is no question about that and is also Duty because Duty I think him family is nuts and bolts love you just take for granted so I wrote this Memoir I had to it was Easter and she came to stay if she was allowed back onto the roof and I sat down in an armchair in the sitting room and I noticed something that I never really knows it's she was this little Sparrow in this John table chair when will my life she'd be in his huge woman who just took over whatever room she was in I realized I'd never thought of her as being a moment older and 53 hey she was she was 87 so she sat with his manuscript on her lap and I expected probably that she would say no you can't do it before she even turned the first page she said Susan I have secrets too and it was this moment where I thought I think I'm finally going maybe actually the two of us I finally going to break through this is going to be the beginning of a new relationship a relationship that's all about understanding and all about respect and everything you want a relationship with your mother to be so I pulled up a stool terribly dickensian when I think about it I mean there I was sitting at my mother's name and I'm 56 years old or something but it was this it was this huge moment and she began to tell me his secrets and I couldn't help smiling because my mother has his shocking memory anything but she doesn't want to remember totally selective And yet when she was telling her stories about being a nurse and Dhawan six days after the bombs were dropped the detail was extraordinary and fascinating and I listened to these stories and then she said I had an affair and I thought I mean who hasn't and fortunately I didn't say only one and then I realize this was a big moment for her so I said yes and she said he was married and I realized in that moment that my mother remember she's eighty-seven she grew up in a generation with to even think of premarital sex was a death-wish a married man with a guillotine so this was the greatest shame imaginable and she carried this lump of Shame around in her chest the 60 years and she never told anyone about it and I realized in that moment that the reason she been tough with me was not because she didn't love me it was because she feared for me she feared that I would make the same mistakes that she would make and the closer I came to making those mistakes and I made all of them in a thousand more the toughest she got because she was more and more frightened she read the manuscript and with great grace file more I think that I could ever have shown under the same circumstances said go ahead with us and then she said you know you could live the life that I always wanted to live message you gave me that life and that was that's probably the only compliment I've ever paid my mother to my eternal shame Christmas rolled around again and my mouth is always being a drama queen the end of last Christmas at the end of last year she had a heart attack and she ended up in hospital and intensive care and I went and sat with her on the first day she was there and I could see she was terrified of death absolutely terrified and she was saying I'm not frightened you father said John said I know I'll be looked after it'll be alright but she was terrified I thought perhaps this is a time to talk that is the time when maybe once again we will break through she was not well I left I came back the next day the bed was empty to be truthful the first Port I had was Freedom was just fixed through just like that and then it was surprised with the most enormous regret all those stupid little things that I'd hang onto because children are far less forgiving of their parents in their parents of children stupid what was it all about pride and ego ridiculous so I'm sitting in this room thinking idiot idiot and this doctor walked him and he said boo can I help you and I said yes I missed it on his daughter and he said I love you and I said no Another You Rang me and he said sure I said why he said when we got to give her a triple bypass and hot dogs replacement Okay so I drive to North Shore really quickly and I went into the hospital and she had by now always surgery and the doctor said the big problem is dementia with patients of her age that's what if they get through the surgery that you have to worry about dementia throwing it on boxing day and she was lying there and she's had this major tube that
