hey this is Graham I'm recording this in May of 2019 and despite summer having not official yet started Wildfire season has already kicked out or maybe it never stopped we have been working on the show over the winter which is honestly felt like a strange time to be producing a podcast on Wildfire since winter is not what I would have considered Fire season but just in case I set up an alert to keep track of news about wildfires both within the United States and outside of it and I was not expecting to see much but boy was I wrongin April there were major fires in both China and Korea and China Sichuan province that borders to bet 30 people including more than two dozen firefighters were killed in one Blaze other fires were also reported including it burn in the mountainous area on the outskirts of Beijing and another in the northern province of Saint she Woodforest at least 9,000 people to evacuate in Korea a fire and con Juan Province prompted a full military response as strong winds move the Flames from city-to-city president Moon jae-in declared a national emergency and it was considered to be quote the worst Wildfire to hit South Korea in the Years also in April in northern Europe fires cropped up in Norway Scotland and West Yorkshire prompting officials to share that fires quote are way above the average and quote the season is drastically worse than those of the last decade this is due in part to a very dry winter and at the time of reporting things were only looking worse meanwhile on the east coast of the US an area not generally associated with wildfires New Jersey was Delta Fire that burned over eleven thousand acres these are all areas not generally considered part of the Wildfire conversation being dealt fires outside of what is generally considered the wild season this is assigned to me that this conversation about the importance of wildfires and how we deal with them extends far beyond the American West which we have primarily been discussing the show this is clearly a worldwide issue and back out west California estate that in the last 2 years has been Del fires that have killed 100 people and burned nearly two million acres has preemptively declared a state of emergency to deal with a terrifying Prospect of another deadly season Governor Newsom share that quote the increasing Wildfire risks we face is the state means we simply cannot wait until fire starts in order to start applying emergency resources and in the Pacific Northwest the place that I call home a record-setting fire season is already kicking in and maintenance report the state public lands commissioner Hilary Franz called it unprecedented quote so far to date we've had 170 fires in Washington state 50 3% of them west of the Cascades and a half to stress that this is a new phenomenon we're not used to having that many fires west of the Cascades and we're not used to having that many fires early-season similarly the Predictive Services National interagency Fire Center is forecasting for the westside of Oregon to have a higher-than-average fire season this is already started off with a fire south of Eugene that is closed roads and asteroid at home so as I read this it is May 24th all this is already taken place this year and we still have months and months of Fire season on its way what do we do this is Wildfire a podcast about the past present and future of wildfire in North America I'm your host Graham Zimmerman and I teamed up with my dear friend and business partner Jamaican to help tell the story of a massive fire in Oregon Columbia River Gorge just outside Portland as we all learn about the natural phenomenon of wildfire this is episode 6 the language of wildfire this is a bonus episode before this one you only have me gram to our goal with this show has been to provide you with the tools that you need to understand Wildfire so that you can be a more informed citizen of the world and have a stronger relationship with our Wild Spaces we cover the science the methods the history and took a look at what we can do in the future all this was provided with the intention of giving you a video of wildfire outside of the 30 to 90 seconds of Doom and Gloom that if so often featured on the news but now that you're rapping at the show you are about to dive back into the media bath the forest burning and threatening communities while engulfing others and smoke clearly from the headlines I shared a moment ago this is already happening as the show comes out and we can expect that it will only get worse as the summer continues so in this final episode now that we're done with the story in Eagle Creek for going to take a little bit of time to army with the tools that you need to disseminate the information that you see on the news be more prepared personally and if you like where you can go to learn more as we worked on the podcast and built our own knowledge base around the subject of wildfire in North America we pulled from a lot of sources to make sure that we were providing you The Listener with the best and most comprehensive set of information that we could but as is often the case for the project like this there are few primary individuals that really acted as our Guides Through This complex and sometimes confusing world of Forestry and fire you've heard from any of these folks but there is one we saved for the end his name is Ralph bloemers Ralph is a co-founder and Senior staff attorney of the Crag Law Center in Portland who's by line is quote legal aid for the environment through this position he has become more and more interested in the role of fire in our forests and has become a community leader focus on educating communities on how they can be better stewards of the space he is deeply invested in understanding the language that is used around Wildfire ranging from the news to politicians to the general public a sort of theory of knowledge when he and I got on the phone to talk about this quote language of wildfire it was not the first time we had chatted far from it so we were able to cut to the Chase and started talking about some of the most important terms to understand when reading or listening to reports of forest fires and Forestry management we started with the term quote healthy forests around but if you dig into the term like let's say you want to help me for a switch vibrant go for a Wilderness or a wild place if it disjointed is the disturb for a sit-down akimbo you know it's it's not a bunch of right angles like the city it's got a dead tree it's got in fact it's got fire moving through it it's got a lot of different things till healthy for us is also used for a variety of different agenda next we talked about the catastrophic and destroyed that haven't been used a lot in the show the other terms that we hear in the media or catastrophic and destroyed and they kind of things that are very negative about fire typically a fire does not destroy a foreign these ecosystems landscape back and are resilient to them and quickly come back after their burn percent contained is next on the list you've heard it in the show and it most likely heard it on the news as well is a metric that sounds clear and concise but it turns out it is anything but that when a fire starts to burn if that's the landscape the percent contained is the function of the perimeter they set eyes. The perimeter based on a landscape not based on where the fires going to burn because they don't know that that's becoming by the wind in the weather in the topography always terribly helpful so what this means is that often times when you hear it on the news it represents somewhat lazy reporting without the proper context to make the information useful we talked about the term active Forest management who to hear thrown around a lot and politics is used to describe logging in logging can take a variety of one standing clear-cutting used to describe prescribe fire and after a fire would you called Salvage logging tree planting it can even be describe Road building or spraying herbicide so active management is not always the same as good management which begs the question how do we know and maybe more importantly when we were buying wood products how do we know if they came from a company with good practices or not there's plenty of companies out there that are leading the way and they use Forest Stewardship Council certification to look at their land and their impact on the Royals and the forest and that there are still trees left for wildlife and at the water systems are for. So I think of the best analog for this is purchasing meat or eggs as a consumer when we buy these products there's a lot of information available about whether these products are cage-free organic free range grass-fed or any of the Myriad of terms the certifications and labels allow us to have more knowledge about where our food came from and they are the result of his asking for that knowledge we need to do the same with our wood products and of course there is our own role in how much we use and how much we feel that we need for what we're trying to do our work or whatever other reason we might use paper and wood products are home with that we started to talk about all the chatter in the media about breaking records like how to season on record or quote worst Wildfire season and how much Credence we should give these numbers my educational background is in science and I remember a lot of discussion about the importance of statistics and Ralph was sharing the same sentiment that if you see a statistic that matters to you verify it and contextualize it by looking at how much information and incorporates whether that be time scale geography or number of incidents put a lifter here is a look at the reference. Set them reporting is referring to are they saying we're being more records than compared to the 1980s or they think we're breaking more records than ever I called shifting Baseline that can make those data say different things around here that we are in fact breaking many important records records that we do not want to be breaking a lot more loss of life a lot more loss of Home longer Fire season hotter temperatures in a lot more carbon the fires and most of all those fires are started on the 4th of July next up we drove into the topic of what we as individuals can do there's a lot of things we can do it a personal level hardener homes is the number one advocate for our leaders at the state local and federal level to spend money to retrofit our building and really get some of that support also in a way that addresses the disproportionate impact from an equity perspective on people that don't have the money to leave their Community when is heavily impacted by smoke I want to dig a Little Deeper on a few of these firstly hardening our homes I remove all the way around the building I made sure the gutters are empty and there's no needles on the roof by Hardscape around the perimeter of the home I put on Ember proof that I need to put on rain gutter guards if I have rain gutters where I get rid of the guttering I have a metal roof and things are the most effective thing you can do they give your home a 95 to 99% chance of survival I think it's important to note that some of these major structural changes we can make the buildings like installing metal roofs can be prohibitively expensive but the smaller less-expensive options like creating defensive space and cleaning out our gutters are just as important we also talked a lot about smoke and love that smoke is water vapor but that smoke also contain particulate that are really harmful to human health particular two more vulnerable populations young and all and people with a breathing ailments like emphysema or cardio pulmonary disease or something like that we have warming shelters we need a retrofit public building have the filtration system and if we can figure out how to ask people have those in their home also provide a safe haven now propose to have to work outside it's really tough people have asked me about face masks in the past but the health authority here in Oregon and in other states they don't recommend them because you need a particular kind of mask and there's not all that are not designed to be well worn for long periods of time because of their effect of the reduction in the oxygen that they produce some comes down to a need for Less exposure particularly for at-risk populations + improved and better implementation of better Shield us from this particular what's it also struck me that knowing more about the Ecology of the wild lands that surround us is an important component to having proper expectations about what we should expect Fire season to hold for our communities a relationship with Wildfire change based on differences in the local ecology and what the forest types for grasslands are around us a change but I hesitate to say these issues are complex to keep people from questioning what they're doing well and in many cases it's it's fairly Elemental and there's broad things that we can pull from what we know to chart our path for Dad said there are differences and it's important to be mindful of his differences which includes you know how we've treated that land in the past and what forces have shaped Atlanta lastly we talked at length about the resources that you The Listener can get out to be more informed about what is going on in your Forest if you want to dig in deeper if you check out driving with fire or forest fires back with a good resources for information on different approaches and you know what deeper understanding of these issues that's not show Fear Bay you know that it's practical and tries to both show the beauty and burn landscape and what we can do to protect the community organization that I really appreciate the work that they're daring and firefighters United for safety and environmental ethics call the question on what are fighting strategies make sense in which ones are doing more harm than good what is a short series of films about forest fire in climate with a stop motion animated owl called. E all that you can find on thriving with fire here on the website on social media which is really good for all ages it shows the benefits of firehouse fire moves fire and whether I'm & Fire and impacts of our responses after fire actually in the middle of working on a feature film about the home safety question but there's pretty extensive resources from the National Fire Protection Association on fire wise and what you can do to create a safety lastly I asked about how much we should pay attention to and rely on predictive resources like the national significant Wildland fire potential Outlook this published by the National interagency Fire Center the challenges we cannot predict where fire will burn in any given year it's totally random we have 350 million Acres of forest hundreds of millions of Acres more of Trouble and grassland and we can't determine where a person will start a fire and how that fire will burn once it started before it died so the thing that it does tell us which homes we need to prepare or more likely we need to prepare for fire and it might tell us some areas that have been degraded or are you at a thick Plantation Forest that is more fire-prone we might want to stand that's on public lands if near a community and so we might want to go in through one that's been replanted and very dense and all even age and do some work in there it would tell us where our road Network are and where are Escape Routes are indoor fire risk and 2 predictions but do so with the knowledge that they can be flawed and we should always be prepared particularly if we are in a fire prone area and this brings us back to why we decided to create a show that wildfire in the first place we didn't so that we can all be more informed and more prepared because the Wildfire phenomenon in the issues associated with it do not exist in a vacuum it is intrinsically linked to everything else in our lives and in the end this is why it matters just as we saw with communities affected by the Eagle Creek Fire with Fire shows up at your door you need to be ready and in the meantime there's a lot that we can do to be better stewards of our Wild Spaces and help mitigate those risks and create a more symbiotic relationship between our societies and the forests on which we Thrive and rely we very much hope that you have found this show to be both informative and inspiring if you want to learn more the resources to Ralph shared are all Linked In the show notes when I encourage you to check them out and with that we bid you adieu and thank you very much for listening Wildfire has been in production of REI Bedrock Bill marks and pod beak and is part of the REI podcast Network the podcast was written by Jim Aikman in myself Graham Zimmerman and was produced by the two of us alongside Chelsea Davis and our editor and Audio Wizard Evan Phillips for more REI podcasts feel free to check out wild ideas worth living and take it from me both available wherever you listen to podcasts keep an eye out for more from this team in the coming months until then we wish you beautiful days in Wild places you're the end of the season of wildfire which probably means you're looking for a new show to binge we recommend a recently-released podcast called the Wild by the folks at kuow in Seattle it's hosted by Chris Morgan an ecologist and filmmaker who gets up close to all kinds of animals that we know in love including bulbs mountain lions and bears and when I say close I mean really close in one of the episodes he talks about the first time that he interacted with a Grizzly the wild uncovers a surprising connections that we share with animals and a wild around us it does it in a way the Highlight the resilient power of nature and The Wonder of the outdoors you can find a wild anywhere that you listen to podcasts
