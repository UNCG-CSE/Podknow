The update is brought to you by the Australian it's been 4 months since the release of a new episode of the teacher's pet let's recap briefly and then deal with a new development in early December last year to take tips from the unsolved homicide Squad of the New South Wales police force Madison prize morning visit to a house that quiet straight in Runaway Bay on queensland's Gold Coast they arrested Christopher Michael Dawson had his investment property there a little over two hours by car from his main residence near the beach on the Sunshine Coast after a brief court hearing in Southport and then his extradition across the state border to New South Wales in a blaze of publicity Christmas formally charged in Sydney with the murder of his first wife Lynette Joy Dawson the former school teacher and star rugby league player has always strenuously asserted his innocence it's really important precise a game that he's position has not changed Chris emphatically denies the charts that he melted lead in 37 years ago in January 1982 now this podcast series went quiet in December last year we haven't produced another episode of the teacher's pet since number 16 came out just as I have to Chris is a rest we believe that it's time now in early April 2019 Philistines to hear an important update police prosecutors and crystals defense team have been busy these past four months at 9 you episodes of the podcast series have been produced because of the serious charge of matter that's being leveled in some countries particularly in the United States journalist and media Outlets done automatically stop investigating rotting and broadcasting with a criminal charges leveled and a trial is pending but the situation is different in Australia tell me a guy eating a step further today it's going to inconvenience tens of thousands of people my currently listening to the series in Australia as well as many more who intended to listen incoming mounts we're sorry for this editors and Executives all the Australian the newspaper for which I would have decided that the 16 existing episodes of the teacher's pet which were produced before this special op diet episode should no longer be a viable in Australia from today we are not sure how long these episodes will be offline that'll depend on Chris's trial the decision to take down these episodes in Australia has not been made lightly but the expert advice we've received is that it is appropriate to help ensure the crystals and gets a fair trial whenever that may be this is vitally important for him and for the criminal justice system the New South Wales Office of the director of public prosecutions has written recently to the newspapers editor-in-chief Chris stupid or to request that we take down the 16 episodes today listing a listing ship and I are the first dryer we are restricting access to the Pod except for this one is the Australians editor-in-chief Christopher door is committed to ensuring a fair trial for mr. Dawson he's entitled to the presumption of innocence just like any Australian facing a criminal trial would restrict access to the podcast as we continue to monitor the case and we will put it online again as soon as we can business might have previously heard the views of Sydney Loya pay Delilah back he's been on both sides of murder trial to x out of his long career as a prosecutor and as a criminal defense lawyer in Australia and in Hong Kong. Last page that he's view all the newspapers decision to take down the podcast in Australia for at least the time being he's taking the podcast down avoids the risk of jurors who have had the podcast series could be influenced even subconsciously by Matt is it might not be relevant or even admissible in a murder trial to finish so I think it would page the alleged murder of line is still a long way off it's possibly going to occur next year 2020 but even that's not certain because of the volume of material in the break of evidence the defense is going to receive more of the Brave in my by taking the podcast series down in Australia this likely to be a fairly long time between when jewelry is wild possibly had a neighbor side till I die from which they hearing the actual evidence in a trial and there's another important possibility legal experts expect Crystal seems very experienced lawyer Greg Walsh apply on his behalf for a trial that would be conducted by a judge sitting alone in an old remove the trial in the Supreme Court that would usually be 12 jurors men and women selected for the jury to hear the evidence and I only the evidence not what I heard on a pod what's on TV and then reach a verdict adjudge align trial is a relatively rare occurrence as they're on our jurors applications for judge align trial are occasionally my by the defense team when there are exceptional circumstances such as overwhelming publicity about a case in cases like they it raises concerns in the defense team about whether a fair trial would be possible with a jury the criminal justice system in the New South Wales accepts that while Jews might be affected by what I've read seen or heard outside Court the judge is highly disciplined and they for an affected by these things that's why there's a remedy of a judge align trial to ensure fair prices Chris's lawyer Greg Walsh was successful in applying for by over his client last December resulting in Chris being released from prison shortly before Christmas his mr. Walsh speaking to journalists in Sydney after December court appearance I've never looked at the podcast is everybody not as bad as been an extraordinary amount of publicity said there's a lot of material I've got a lot to digest by the things that concerns me is that this man is entitled to the presumption of innocence play Not Guilty he strenuously asserts his innocence and he should be afforded that fundamental rod and you know appreciate the lady have the rights and obligations but any citizen in that country has those fundamental rods and I would ask everybody to let the court do its work and it's very important in our justice system variable a game that's a difficult question I have a great belief in the jury system when I that is other forms of trials in this country back with the extent of knights of the media reporting and it is a concern that some of that reporting with respect is rather divisive and it's coming from an ideological perspective that he must be guilty that is a worry because it can distort people's memories and it's been a significant align is case and it's been inadequacies in the investigation by the police so yeah I die of genuine concerns that the media have a particular audiological view that the man must be guilty now that's that's just not Rod if anybody here was facing a charge that want to be in top of the resumption of Innocence in this impromptu media conference back in December mr. Walsh Also Rises suggestions that Len Dawson was singing on a diet after she was alleged to have been limited fuel surprised they purported bank card transaction some wake size to Lynn's disappearance so there are aspects of the investigation that have prejudiced the place should have conducted proper investigations and don't witness statements at the time which would have indicated that probably she was alive can I just say this it seems most unusual that a lady with the greatest respect of Linda Wilson would disappear and not have any contact with the children I mean that's obviously alive issue it has happened on Emma with another case where a woman disappeared to 60 years and her daughter only found out that she'd gone to New Zealand had married and had a family after she died in 2002 and a daughter did not know where her mother is gone forever 60 is it does happen so I haven't typically asked him that question and it doesn't not be honestly doesn't know list of all Smite some further associations and he's most recent media conference in February after another court appearance in sitting on behalf of Chris we believe that In fairness to Chris it's appropriate for his lawyers comments to be included in this podcast. Mr Bowles told reporters that he received part of the Brave of evidence from the Prosecuting Office some four and a half thousand Pages plus multiple computer disk drive setting up to about 10000 Pages he said he expected the close to the same amount of material again would be handed over by the DPP in my next month to examine Pockets Plaza by the crown he's played a very thankful row besides it's very experienced pleasure. Mr. Walsh then turned to some of the actual evidence that has been handed I have a to the defense being sorry right now things are bonded with paste some of the material Greg Welch rise the many gigabytes of documentary material and audio he will need to analyze and here to prepare for the defense of Chris Dawson Ohio list of all she is of course entitled to put his best foot forward for his client and there are sound legal reasons why we're not going to the Bible challenge his assertions the teacher's pet is a podcast series investigated and written by met Hedley Thomas with audio and music production by slide Gibson the podcast series is brought to you by the Australian
