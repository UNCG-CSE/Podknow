it's fueled by this idea that all men are evil all men are shit toxic masculinity is what they call it but no one can deny that in this day and age there is a general sense of entitlement growing a sense that I deserve what I deserve and if I don't get it then there's something wrong with the world young men these days are certainly not immune from falling into this way of thinking I'm sure by now you've heard the term incel it stands for involuntary celibate and is often used to describe usually a guy who can't get any for all intensive purposes Elliot Rodger who killed six people and injured 14 in Isla Vista California and who we first talked about in episode 19 was a self-described in cell he put up video after video on YouTube about how no woman would sleep with them so they

the Adirondack Mountains in the Mohawk Valley it has been a long time since Utica experienced its Glory Days in the late 19th century Utica was one of the wealthiest cities per capita in the United States largely due to its waterways and Rail lines that pass through the town Utica was able to support a variety of businesses one of which was Savage Arms founded in Utica and awarded a contract with the British government during World War 1 to produce one of the first light machine guns the m1917 Lewis gun with a combination of Savage Arms other businesses and The Valleys thriving Lumber and textile Industries its economic growth was preceded in the twentieth century however The Boll Weevil epidemic destroying cotton crops and the migration of textile mills to the right-to-work Southern States meant that Unica would see a decline in business and population when the city struggled in the late 20th century to adapt to electronics & defense industries that fill the Gap left by textiles it's soon saw companies like General Electric and Lockheed Martin leave the area to while Utica saw its economy slow at eventually become nearly stagnant the town did have something else to offer centrally located in New York state it quickly became a living destination for immigrants and refugees from around the world because of the low cost of living today it's a diverse Community with many nationalities ethnicities in over 15 spoken languages this sense of inclusion started well before the 1970s but was epitomised in 1978 went to local businesses Utica radiator and FX Matt Brewing

promote the physical and emotional well-being of the community this year the 42nd annual race was held on July 14th but it was the first time in memory where the race didn't start on time while the community and Runners from around the world war gathering for a good clean competition police activity nearby postpone the race for about 20 minutes earlier this morning we received the call through dispatch in the early hours of that morning the police received multiple calls about a man who claimed to have killed his girlfriend and was threatening to hurt himself the police department began an in-depth search for the couple during their search 911 received another call this time from the man in question the origin of his phone call was tracked to a street off Culver Avenue during an investigation we were directed to post street are we located a vehicle about a half a mile from the start of The Boilermaker is post re a residential street that dead-ends into a small wooded area the very end of the street is barely wide enough for a single-vehicle the first officer on the scene spotted alone black SUV at the end of Poe Street beside the SUV was a single male as the officer approached the male attempted to take his own life by cutting his throat at that point the officer engaged to the mail in conversation while holding him at gunpoint other officers arrived in a single ultimately disarming the mail and taking him into custody as the officers tried to talk to suicidal man down from the proverbial ledge he laid down on a tarp that was placed near the SUV and stabbed himself in the neck at this point they still didn't know where the female was but they had a clue brown hair protruding from beneath the tarp when asked the man confirmed that his girlfriend was under the tarp when backup officers arrived they were able to disarm the man during a slight struggle he was taken to the hospital and immediately into surgery for the severe self-inflicted wound to his neck was located at deceased female it was upgrading a male that staying severe injuries he's been transported to a local hospital for treatment and currently in surgery the female is outside the vehicle in the mail was located outside the vehicle it appears that most injuries were from a sharp instrument but right now we're still early investigation The Boilermaker road race was eventually allowed to start women all good luck they're already Duval trained really hard for that's right angle what a great vantage point right here and Katrina and I did talk to a couple of races just a few moments ago they said it does add to the anxiety of this a little bit of a weight but there are there are there they go right down Culver Ave for those of a stuck on the u.s. customary units of measurement 15 km is a little less than 9.5 miles last year's Champion Gabriel GA from Tanzania won the race for the second year in a row with a time of 43 minutes and 36 seconds to hours and 5 minutes faster than the last person to finish that is a pace average of 4 minutes and 41 seconds per mile in case you're into this sort of thing he ran the race faster than he had the year before breaking his own record by 4 seconds the news of a man murdering his girlfriend was in stark contrast to the spirit of the race and the spirit of the community as the rest of the runners trickled in Spectators lined the streets to cheer them on as they followed the race route the police follow the leads but already the news of the murder and attempted suicide was hitting local and Regional media Outlets but first a murder a homicide stalling this morning's Boilermaker Utica Police are now investigating after they say a woman was found dead outside a parked car on Pole Road on July 15th the Utica Police Department released a statement to the public with what they knew about the case it reads in part with respect to their relationship it was learned that the two had met on the social media platform Instagram approximately two months ago they utilize this as a means of communication primarily and their relationship progressed into a personal intimate one that spent time together at work waited with each other's families on Saturday July 13th 2019 the information that we have received is that they in fact did go to the concert arriving around 7:30 p.m. they left the venue and proceeded back to Utica sometime after It is believed that some sort of argument ensued at the venue that precipitated the following engagement between the two sometime during the early morning hours of Sunday July 14th 2019 the to write back and proceeded to the post relocation the investigation revealed that the argument progressed until the male produced a large black handled knife and use this to inflict the injuries that cause for death during this time it is believed that he took and distributed photographs of the killing on the Discord platform members of Discord then view the images and posts and contacted the Utica Police Department the press release named the two involved in the incident the victim was 17 year old Bianca Devin's of Utica and the offender was 21 year old Brandon Clark of Cicero New York victim Bianca is was just 17 years old and it just graduated Proctor High School Utica Police are navigating a maze of leads including many disturbing one on social media where Bianca was a small-scale influencer traditional news media and the police were playing catch-up and the information they were gathering was already tainted by a massive online community to see the story actually broke on Twitter a journalist named Ian miles cheong tweeted a 17 year old was murdered by an Orbiter who knew her on Discord me and Miles cheong Twitter is that is that how that works okay and what is that it is a magazine political magazine be talked about culture politics some entertainment it's the magazine of Ronald Reagan you know the publication of choice it's Ronald Reagan established thing it's been awhile but you Management's its own by Wilt Chamberlain oh wow okay that's interesting and so you work for them On LAN what sort of basis as a journalist I'm a journalist and I be managing editor I see you post a lot about a lot of different things and I am just about to go to bed a couple nights ago and I see this really sort of shocking tweet come through and it had to do with the death of young girl that's right yeah Dunkin Donuts can you tell me how you came across the story how did this first come to you it was forwarded to me by a friend on Discord right it was something that it was a really getting much traction was really blowing up start a lot of people are talking about it but she thought I would find it interesting and sure enough I looked into it I was horrified at first you know I was like okay this kind of hits home right it hits home it's it's a girl who was you know popular on Instagram will relatively popular I think she had like ten thousand followers or so which is no big deal in the world but you know it's not nothing and people were talking about her and I was thinking okay this could have been any one of my friends do you know this interest me in a way that I don't really enjoy but I want to get a story out and people need to know about what happened to her and how this this is not like a like an abnormality you know a lot of people are treating this as an abnormality like it can't happen to anybody but the fact is that it can happen to any one of them why they can happen to your sister can happen to your your girlfriend your best friend you know it could happen to anybody it was spread by Word of Mouth through Discord at first and then it made the rounds on I think fortune and some other stuff uniforms that's when people started talking about it and the hashtag RIPD on, so it wasn't really trending on Instagram but it really took off that's kind of where it started because the guy who murdered her what you done on Instagram but he made it an Instagram story and a bunch of her friends saw it that's when they said it's reading about it or rather you not posting on Instagram about it Discord is a free voice and text chat platform geared towards gamers after Bianca's death a picture appeared on a private server once shared by Bianca and her friends the picture was of Bianca with her throat slashed open body was slumped into the floorboards of a car with her head and shoulders resting on the seat next to her sliced neck was a large black handled knife covered in blood her eyes are half open and staring blankly the caption above the photo said sorry fuckers you're going to have to find somebody else to orbit those in the thread thought it was a hoax at first a friend of Bianca's who was in the service shortly after the picture was posted was one of the first people to suspect that it was real here is Chels an interview with independent journalist neck Monroe from r9k the server rear end was Paul cheap Village a lot of people know where from there a lot of people knew from that specific place that I Know Her Like A lot of people are like telling you like Obama by you don't really know how are you just trying to talk to you no like I've known this girl for a long time she was a Sweet Soul and didn't deserve this shit the man who killed her I honestly don't know much he didn't post much wasn't really that active what I saw that he posted he had tagged Bianca and a few local murder-suicide news articles which was very strange and kind of concerning But like everyone just brush it off like okay maybe he's just so weird guy yeah that's pretty much all I knew I just knew that she considered him her friend she just thought he was a friend and he had a fascination with out this person was not her boyfriend he was not an ex-boyfriend there are no signs of him being a stalker I can't be a hundred percent sure you that but she wanted him to bring her and take her home from the concert and I don't believe that via with yourself in a situation like that if she felt like she was not see it at all or death shells describe Bianca's Behavior as normal concerts just trying to invite these girls on the server to the concert with her which I'm glad they didn't go cuz they could have ended up getting killed to what happened first I had china this chat and I was like everyone is getting really serious like oh my gosh that's going on and then I scroll up and I see the image of her with her throat and like I was like and then everyone's like okay like this might not be real someone might just sleep you a hoax like we were all like in complete disbelief of everything and then I looked at a picture of her compared to the picture that was posted of a nose was the same the eyebrows were the same time like this might actually be real and then the person who was with her and Brendan concert message me and was like Chelsea you know any of y'all has information I think she's in danger and I'm like oh my God that when he contacted me he told me that Bianca seeing that they were in seminary and making out and he said that after they were doing that that Brandon was upset but that was hours prior to her murder is so I'm not sure if you like what those negative feelings Fester inside of him or if there was another motive but that's the only thing they makes sense to me and honestly I don't think we'll ever know really what his motive was and I'm like oh my god oh no someone in her server just posted a really awful picture and I don't know if it's her and then we both started panicking and then basically everyone in the server just started to take screenshots and try to collect evidence and then we contacted her local authorities and someone who had Brandon on Snapchat was able to find his location on Snap maps and then sent them there Brandon posted that picture to Discord the others on the server screenshots and started their own investigation others however spread the picture to other servers and other social media platforms posted her 40 picture in the Discord itself and that picture was making the rounds so you know people who use Discord many of them use like multiple different server so somebody in their took the screenshot the whole thing and shared it with other people so it got around that way and then it went to your 4chan Instagram and someone started to spread pretty quickly the Instagram I noticed something pretty early on on Instagram which was pretty disturbing there was some guy on Instagram I'm trying to find the actual page now but he had posted his own story with some pictures of the killer that had not previously been released anywhere else that I hadn't seen anywhere else this person was immediately sort of like docs on Reddit and they started trying to figure out who this was cuz they thought that the person running the Instagram page was the actual killer obviously that's as may be sent cuz the the pictures had the guy's neck almost sunap yep I had actually posted those pictures on his own Instagram story he actually took pictures of himself trying to kill himself right according to police reports is like in a threatening to kill himself and that he himself and then himself and they were like wondering what the hell he was doing so I think this is someone who followed him maybe a friend or just so you know acquaintance to happen upon the story and took screenshots of it before Instagram could remove them because when I checked it Instagram had already removed all of his stories even though his account is still active what are the stories reads Here Comes hell it's Redemption right there were also a few pictures of Brandon at the end of post read one caption reads thanks to everybody who was good to me I'll miss you all a letter caption read I'm sorry Bianca behind the caption was a green tarp on the ground with an obvious balls underneath in the foreground was Brandon's blood-stained hand another caption read ashes to ashes over a picture of Brandon's self-inflicted Neck Road at a blood-soaked shirt shortly before he was apprehended by authorities he has birthday yeah and then he thought he would. He's not dead he's in the hospital now he also added the line just know I feel no pain down The Morbid curiosity exists unless all I mean that's kind of why you're listening to this episode this curiosity was something many people online preyed upon using the image of Bianca as some sort of lure to get likes and followers I saw your tweet I immediately thought I want to see the photo and then I thought this is nuts that's a really horrible thought that kind of trouble I went to sleep woke up the next day I get up I go to brush my teeth go to the bathroom they steal my phone and I start looking for the photo first thing in the morning and then I I get out of the bathroom I come back to bed and she's sitting there looking for the photo her I mean like nature is turn on your head of what happened based on what you found out about story and you kind of want to get that confirmation or lack of n o that sort of like discrepancy so that you can put the pieces together on your head in a way that makes sense in a story that makes no sense that's what I did and since there was photography right when Jack the Ripper kills his victims people want to see the photos right that's the first thing when was that 70s everybody was just looking for the leaked photos obviously like this situation really hits home because what comes to mind you know when I hear about a young girl uses Discord uses Twitter or Instagram and she gets brutally murdered the first thing that comes to mind of my own friends talk to you about maybe 10 different people the same thing you're like well it could have been me you know that's what they're thinking that's what I'm thinking as well as like that's horrifying right it could have been any single one of them could have stopped them and done what this dude it's a Bianca so yeah you want to see the photo but you also kind of don't and you'll see the one you want to split it we just why I never spent a photo right because a lot of people like I want to see it go to 4chan it's probably there in front page you don't need to ask nobody for his disgusting a lot of people you know try to Bank in on the right you had these accounts and I know that some of them I I posted some screenshots of these accounts people were making you accounts getting followers posting the the gore and you know lying to people in teasing them they know there's a video if you follow this private account so that's how they got followers although there's no video to my knowledge right there's no video if you try to get people to follow them videos followers and I would speculate that's not obviously some of these people are just trying to blow up Instagram accounts followers you can very easily make you know like $50 if you sell it on say one of those hacker forums never happened this getting posted on Instagram live know there where is a story posted on Brandon's whatever his Instagram and it was just her bloody body nothing was posted that was like a video there's no video everyone saying that there's a video to try to get you to follow its not real don't believe them don't give them the attention that they want and that they're looking for in the follow is in the clicks that they want because it's just sad that people using heard that's about Chase like you're pathetic it's me help Instagram user known by the handle I can't stop being sad was one of the few people to see Brandon story before it was taken down it'll I broadcast shortly after I posted the screenshots to his own story you can hear his excitement over his moderate increase in Fame uuuu was good I'm super high right now Priyanka Priyanka oh she died Pierre boyfriend I didn't hear that Brandon guy I just named the type of rain already you serious you really what the fuck that's so cool 57 e c t Fords fucking five-year what is good to everybody but that's what I got you. If you want to join this life my Ig know where your shoes are whatever you with each new viewer his excitement grows I'm all over no rash Albany or what is good everybody 22 fucking people during the live broadcast he gets a call from a friend that explains what he's hearing from his viewers I need a listing about to reply but I don't want to lose this is 40 people if needed the girl and then Ohio the idea that people would clap Chase or exploit the death of a young girl to Garner influence or money made disgust you but so getting Cloud on the death of a young girl wasn't the Gory photo we're at the USANA for nice selfies and they had let me see if I can pick it up I have it saved here on my phone but I've been treated it out and it bothered me so much bother me more than these people can I get cloud from it because you know this Sandy C and posted where like that's literally the snap yeah II your news stories and if they get the details wrong they call him her boyfriend and they don't even care about her side by side and this is what happened to her haha and it's disgusting this is when the internet took over countless people begin to share the image of Bianca and delve into her and Brandon's background looking for anything to make sense of what happened quickly many alternative narratives a rose The Narrative the following day when I checked again was all this sort of weird misandrist man-hating commentary about how you guys are all terrible dick heads they're all in cells and and you know how quickly that narrative took over on Twitter spell narratives what I saw right you had the feminist narrative in which year old men have blamed and some of my friends even posted this stuff and these are women who are not feminists who is sharing their experiences and they got back for a bike dies who took offense to them so that's interesting people because they experienced it personally and they're thinking this could have happened to me this could have happened to my friend you know so it affects them so when I see the misandrists commentary I'm not mad about it I'm not upset I'm not upset when you don't like a like I said nineteen-year-old Grill post about it because it's a more personalized thing you know she's talking about the bad guys Good Guys internet history can make them look pretty bad but it's never taken in context Bianca had an extensive online history that went back for years what people found they run we chose to use to define her that's where these alternative narratives come in but before we delve into this case any further I think it's important to take a moment and Define some of the terms we've heard so far and some were about to hear if you're as old as me you'll appreciate Ian here shedding some light on the internet lingo I had to look up all of these terms that I never heard of before when I did it to the story orbiters based oh my God so many thought it's like there's a whole Community out there that has its own language that sort of been developed one mean at a time does conglomeration of many different communities comes from gaming right that's a gaming term he thought comes from like to eat let's go through them one by one because they're kind of fascinating so the whole gamergate movements that one right only found out about it when I was looking up your name and fussing a little bit about you I was Auntie gamergate at the time so he knows you share that I was feeling all the time yeah but just don't speak to because like it got really frustrating after a while because I would see a lot of my friends or not friends acquaintances Associates whatever you want to call him the dumbest things right you know like that the sound that the frog makes no it's not like what are you talkin about so do you get mad about the dumbest things and I want to call him out but I couldn't write this is always something that's only something that I can call him out because he cancels and so that's based based means grounded means like you know not giving a damn about anything right that's it it's a good thing someone who usually you don't you know the reply guy thing that you guys always reply to girls my God it's so hot in Herre you like smoking pot a wet orbiting around a woman so to speak Randy Grill is just a grill online so my friends are you I guess you could call them patreon or like a p balance the money it's weird it's a thing they do that that's what they say you have the orbiters you know who are usually nice guys you know it's not even married it's weird I don't know why they do it but they do it right we can get with her or did they just like the female company not all of them are bad people but they are kind of pathetic by that's what you told Beena like beat us in cell Stills guys are well involuntarily celibate and they're mad about it right and you know some people would like if you don't like me to call me an incel for example I told people insults maybe as a joke but that is a no brain cells are like in Celsius at a few different ones they got a band self-identify as in cells and these guys be hate women like they stalk women like me of a female friends have at least one or two incels restock them right just like any orbital would but they also send them like rape threats of death for us to get a woman's attention but they're mad that they're not getting it so they think they're entitled to it as we mentioned a prime example of an incel is Elliot Rodger a more recent example is Alek minassian the perpetrator of last year's van attack in Toronto who posted online the incel Rebellion has begun we will overthrow all the Chad's and Stacy's All Hail to the Supreme gentleman Elliot Rodger incel Rebellion believe it or not is a term that is interchangeable with beta Uprising or beta male Uprising I wish I were making all of this shit up I don't I don't mean to laugh but it I mean people are fucking ridiculous they're fucking insane they are probably they spend too much time bolstering their stupid ideologies don't have any female friends they think women are difficult to talk to you so when they see a guy like me or no we are fine were you in traffic women all the time you know we have female friends hold a female friends Sky he's such an asshole right so we get called Chad's there are a few more definitions according to incels. Wiki Chad is someone who can elicit near Universal positive female sexual attention at will a Chad tends to be between 1/8 to attend has an extremely high income and or an extreme amount of social status guess I'm a Chad and it's that's that's what I am he can have sex with a wide variety of women and has exclusive access to Stacy Chad is not necessarily a male model but all male models are Chad's a Stacy you may I ask what is a Stacy we're about to find out a Stacy is the ultimate embodiment of every Wicked depraved aspect of feminine nature that wow a stereotypical mean girl or cheerleader who is able to secure sexual intimacy with Chad she is vain obsessed with jewelry makeup and clothes she is an entitled hor who's rich daddy Farms her Caribbean Vacations To Go find herself she entertains a flock of orbiters who shower her with attention and validation only to open her legs for Chad instead Becky's on the other hand or subordinate to Stacy's in terms of looks and social status in other words the average young woman despite their lower position on the social totem pole they will nonetheless ignore around 80% of men in their youth unless she makes more money than her this sexual jacking off and puts them at odds with both each other as well as the Stacy's she was popular online just getting a lot of this attention at most of it was I guess that's normal attention but a lot of it wasn't when the internet Collective began to scour through Bianca's extensive history online they found some things that were disturbing chat logs surfaced where Bianca didn't come off too well she went by the name Xanax or Xanax or oxy one thread where her name was Xanax red have too many orbitals I can bounce back with twice as fucking hard you know you mean Jack schitt to me I can replace you in a fucking second you are nothing I was cheating on you anyways never cared about our relationship you were always here just to plan B as a backup but I didn't have anything better to do I used you another where her name is Dan Reed guys including you when we first met up until the day we met I was with multiple guys and I didn't even remember your name had to search it up in our Discord history before meeting you I wanted to ghost you but I found out you were crazy because you called me on a blocked number you were literally nothing until the day we met I could have replaced you in seconds yet another post where her name is oxy reads let me break it down for you all I don't care what you think of me honestly I could drop this all if I want it but I like the validation because daddy issues am I using you sure am I hurting them yeah selfishness I know but I do care about them I help people when they're upset and I check on them whenever possible it's mutualism in a sick weird way I don't mean to hurt anyone on purpose I just want to love everyone and be loved by everyone because I'm too introverted and anxious to do it in real life even though I'm entirely capable of that her account on tellonym Anonymous messaging app where you post the answered questions and messages revealed some disturbing content as well account name was e c s t y or x c presumed to be an abbreviated version of ecstasy her bio drops down the knife on the floor seductively Ono winky face kicks it towards you how Reckless of me lies down in a vulnerable position oh no looks like I... the Bayou stops there some of the anonymous questions reveal aspects of her past and the things she deals with Armand keep in mind this is an underage girl some of the Q&A is as follows can I buy Pennies from you I just want to let you know I really enjoyed the aesthetic thank you I got super paranoid so like I don't know I'll still be a hoe so you know the Vibes and parentheses this is a joke in self awful person this would have been relevant three years ago another tell warned her of potential danger oddly relevant after her death after you got banned going back is probably going to bring you a lot more problems in the future and I only had so far thanks for caring and to be honest I think I'll be okay but her Tumblr where she went by the username switchblades there was another example of eerie foreshadowing the last post she made on the day before her death was a readily available Meme and reads as follows on July 14th a personal computer for good my mobile phone will be disconnected in melted with thermite I shall burn all my identification money and papers then I will commence to walk Eastward into the Rising Sun the rest of her Tumblr account was filled with images of Japanese anime emo culture jewelry black clothing and the cop imagery like a picture of a dark basement with the caption scary dark place next to a sticker of Hello Kitty another image was of a shirt that said straight out of the morgue and another was a collection of knives once again next to cute images this time of cartoon bunnies and kittens amongst her other posts is the question a knife are you flirting with me and multiple other images of knives drugs bandages pink fuzzy handcuffs and one simply saying kill me Bianca seem to have an obsession with sex and the Dark Side of humanity I'm not surprised I have no friends or h2o stuff like that all the time they're depressed as I don't believe there is just like emo culture kind of the same thing like sad girl hours and then you know basically having fantasies about themselves I don't take it too seriously know the two narratives that emerged based on a myopic view of her life there was the misogynist point of view where Bianca got what she had coming siding hurry girl activity online as her asking for it but if you're if you're sort of a public figure and you know that's a long stretch to say something like this is ventral with an Instagram and you're putting that kind of stuff out there you're in the invitation for someone that unhinged to come along and you know take you up on your offer seems very dangerous is very high I mean the chances are very high which is why I tell people I don't like all the ways you need to be more careful online you know you can't just be posting stuff like this because you will invite the wrong people and even though it's not your fault you don't realize how famous you are right it's it's a dangerous world out there and there's a lot of crazy people who will hurt you because they think that they should and it's sad but that's kind of how it is and it doesn't even take you know popularity really you know a lot of women who reached out to me they told me like you know they had the same experiences that people creeping on them some people have been obsessed with them for years now and the police can't do anything about it and they're not even that popular right they have like two hundred followers even then there's always going to be some guy who latches onto them like princess my friend the one who showed me this stuff because it home for her a guy was stalking her in a video game they played a couple of games together started talking he know became friends and it was like a week I date only known each other for a week and one day she decides that she know she's she's busy she's not up to reply like everybody right so she doesn't reply to him like a date and he just slips out start sending her all these texts which I posted and some people kind of misconstrue that I mean to confuse sit for Bianca text which they weren't and this dude is like threatening to kill himself you know being like a super nice guy type thing that you know I'm the kind of guy who would change your oil for you when you know when you're asleep I'm going to clean the house for you I mean you're missing out on this end of this this is a type of the type of people you meet online when it is soon as attention the act like this for just today I mean some guidance just playing another game with unlike the phone saw her Avatar in this and was like I think we're best friends now it's like you don't even notice my name what are you talkin about but that's what women deal with online then there was the misandrist point of view where Brandon was a stalker didn't know when to take a hint and murdered her because of incel jealousy let's talk about her and her negative attention because there is quite a bit of that online that I saw she was a young girl she was 17 but there was some incident that occurred maybe a few years ago when she was 14 ish around that age that a lot of people didn't like her for did you know anything about that yeah like she I believe she was like bipolar all right so she had one of those magic moments where she was seeing all the guys are being clingy and you know how guys are online weather really clingy whenever they get female companionship is so they were being clingy and she was like not having their shit she was telling them off your saying I used you for attention I don't want you anymore I don't need you around your disposable you're nothing to me right so she was posting all of the stuff online and clear things up for her you know it's not like she's a bad person she was just going through a hard time she had a tough family life you know her mom was in and out of hospitals in and she's got like mental illness herself and you know her friends were telling me about how you know she's kind of turned to drugs people are talking about not that it would even justify you know her death because I saw some people saying Oxycontin you know and so she deserves to die she's a waste of human her username was oxy something right on it was she did a lot of pot and she did some acid you know because she just wanted to be happy and learning that make me very sad this was a sad girl write this was a someone who had a life who just want to be happy she wasn't a bad person you know she had friends she was Raising her two sisters people really cared about her all the time that's what he oxy thing from what I was told she didn't want us and she threw up when she took the name because you know you don't nickname stick right it was an event what you did it was like some friends of Discord and you didn't like it and then to just start calling her that so she's stuck with the name from my perspective on the whole ordeal because I was there during the whole time during all of the you know oxy trials whatever she was amateur she was emotionally traumatized from what I could see from past events she was acting out and ways because of it and she has changed as a person she has no remaining qualities of who she was then besides her positive ones so the people who are trying to dig up old drama that happened two years ago when she was 14 to 15 that's pathetic it's just pathetic and there's no way justifies her being murdered whatsoever and I think it's really terrible how people are using her death to fit certain aspects of their own agenda like some people were using it to like turn it into like a man heating thing and some people are using it as like oh she was targeted because she is bubbly but it's like know this was something that happened out of pure jealousy he alludes to that very clearly and the things that he says on this board so it's really sad that people are like Swiss eanes independent journalist Nick Monroe conducted another interview after Chels with a friend Bianca do in real life that lives in Utica Cesar sheds light on her actual life behind the scenes of her online Persona she was very sweet and she's very Lively and she was very fine without I hate to say it but the drugs it really was that and whenever those were involved things got bad but these men that people are talking about that she mistreated were older men preying on her that screencap that everyone has been posting of her telling this dude to fuck off whatever it was he was some twenty or year old granddaughter if you would tell me these stories of these weirdos she was 15 with a mental disorder I don't understand how you think it's her responsibility to take care of herself to keep herself safe around older men have people literally saying oh she deserved it for how she treated matter what she did with men these were older man needs are fully adult males I know how that is where the mental illness takes over but she had remarkably good control of it and if you weren't hard shity the older man taking advantage of her than she didn't treat you like that as far as far as I can tell about a single example of pathos examples that we haven't are literally talking to humans Scott and I think that anyone if there's going to be point that blaming of people and talking about shit like that I don't understand how you don't look at these older men preying on her and not get mad at Batman said say oh she was mistreating man that's that's the most incel thing I've ever heard the other things I want to say is that it is also on the other hand it's true she made very bad decisions that she was mentally ill it's true that drugs heavily affected this and it's true that I genuinely think she just didn't have much to do sometimes that this was how she thought she was going to keep herself a big board I think that happens to a lot of people but it is very true when you see these women on Twitter and Instagram saying like be careful around these guys some of them are making it out to be you know like men are scary but some of them are genuinely saying be careful with these people and keep yourself safe and that's absolutely true because ultimately she and I had bad experiences with him and kept hanging out with them and I know that he had control over her through manipulation probably to some amount of grooming and through those drugs but ultimately when you know a guy is bad you have to not hang out with them this is not the first time that I've had friends of mine that go all he's kind of like this but you know I'm going to go see him anyway you all have to keep yourselves safe and the other main point is that people were acting and this is the only thing that really bothers me that people were acting like she was a terrible person and she wasn't screencaps that people are posting from her are old she was literally 15 at the time Tyler post from her about her telling you no pictures or whatever you know the basic PCP and somehow people think that we knew that we'd somehow people think that we saw that page or whatever it we were just like we just kind of ignored it we bought them stupid stuff when we were fifteen and Bianca was clearly no exception she liked the attention she got with her edgy comments online who doesn't every interaction she had online fueled her new persona but she wasn't really that person at all with the news media reporting the wrong details we are all still wondering exactly who she really was how she knew Brandon and what really happened it's kind of confusing because I mean if you would have asked if I say okay let's say something happened to you today right and the police were interviewing people that you know if they talked to your mom give them false information right unless you're like super closing you tell her everything right so that's kind of what happened here because according to her friends as well as to police themselves like a couple of months he he was someone in the area that she had met on either just scored or a dating app right may be tender right so she was someone that my understanding is that he insinuated himself into her family life right so you know two people in her family you know they would have seemed that they would date him because he was always online and he was the only guy you was around right that that's why it's confusing and that's why it's conflicting and I also dislike the narrative that you know this was someone that she knew in real life because from what I saw and this was done by some some YouTubers some people have a lot of clout they were trying to dispel the whole narrative that they didn't know each other effectively did was kind of defending the whole you know the fear that know the genuine fear that people have of all night stalkers because they issue so people stop caring about it you know it it's like nowadays when you hear that a guy is beating up his girlfriend or that you know he might have even like hospitalized her no one really cares it's it's not a big deal but if you hear from the internet might have done it then suddenly everybody cares it's terrible but that's just how it is so when I saw people or snow when I see people saying that each other in real life I feel like they're trying to downplay it in the way even if they don't really realize it because people just stop caring if it was just how it was to boyfriend who did this thing about it is the fact that it posted it on Instagram well it is sort of place to our biggest fears of of like the the breakdown of the social contract of you don't just have to kill a random stranger from the internet for no reason you know that kind of thing we're at if you have like a domestic violence situation its domestic violence unfortunately so common that it's almost like we'd be just we are bored of it was right which is why I try to do my best to make sure that you know that wouldn't be the narrative that stuck you know what I mean but he told the police you know when he stabbed her and the police hadn't confronted with guns and stuff and so they reported that as a fact that's horrifying I mean if she was still alive should be a guest at this whole thing Brandon apparently she knew that Brandon was bad news and she had had bad experiences with him before he left her stranded once this is such an important story you know I guess a lot of people think that we as our friends like weren't didn't get involved in Opera I had no idea she message me on Snapchat saying hey can I get money for a ride back to your house like 5 no man figure it out yourself cuz I didn't know what was going on I was just like mad and I'm just going to pay you cuz you're too dumb to get back to Utica I didn't know that you got it cuz she and she didn't tell me what actually happened she just said that her and her friend were stuck there and better friend like that she got ditched by another friend or something I felt a little bad a few minutes later I said hey if you really have a picture when you need to get home I will pay for you and she said no no no I already got it but you never told me that what happened with Brandon at all her drugs and that was always how we got her to hang out with him even though she didn't want to was all kinds of free drugs he drop her off and then bad things will happen sometimes you didn't even want to do that and she told me about this I think the last time I hung out with her I'm pretty sure that's who she was talking about that she would need some guy or whatever and that you would want her to drink hard liquor and stuff and then do other shit and I was like yeah I just want as I knew I thought this was cuz I had met some of her friends before I thought this was like some of her fucking idiot friends that she knew from high school that weren't too dangerous I didn't know it was some guy like this if I knew I would have been more involved but she made sure that I didn't know specific way she talked about these people she had issues with but when she told me about those stories she talked about them in the past tense if she knew that Brandon was trouble a question why she would still be friends with them well the sad thing is is leading up but everything was good and that last few weeks she is far as I know I think I heard this actually from her family that she was finally off drugs when I first met her she was heavily on drugs Nick clearly heavily infected that was how a lot of these men had control over with through drugs and properties of drugs it's such a cancer on society and such a cancer on her life we have no idea but my main point again is she was really nice girl that was really those those drugs that did it to her but where do we go from here that's a question I think everybody should be asking where do we go from here well obviously women should take care of a few know who to interact with online they should be quicker to block people that even stopped some people some people just keeps talking you write go to the police and obviously the police need to take these things more seriously you know in a lot of cases you go to the police reported they don't care something needs to be done and the police were updated changed and how to deal with this that these situations they need to be lost that prevent people from harassing people in a crossed Interstate lines example that could be a nice start but if you are in one state and you said harassing somebody in another state you can't really get in trouble for it and it's hard to prosecute some that's an issue and I don't know what like guys need to be more mindful of the stuff they say online as well I mean you'd want to be a creep right and I know this is going to come off as it's like sounding like kind of feminist and it's like saying Teach rapists not to rape sucking at work right but I think I think people should just be more mindful of how they behave online and they should also not be so dismissive of women women talk about these things is easy to get mad and then be like this crazy feminist ranting about men again you know I mean it's easy to to generalize and stare stereotype at both ends here and I think in terms of Dino just because you're unattractive woman doesn't mean that every guy out there's going to rape you but at the same time you know you have to practice some some common sense in terms of who you interact with and from a from a guy's perspective you know not all women out there or crazy feminist just because they they they Advocate you know being Mindful and being aware of your surroundings is not you know letting creeps like this in your life exactly exactly bothers me when you know like most of my female friends are not feminists they get annoyed when they see some feminists complaining about manspreading and that brings up another topic like the ones who call themselves feminists less about the bullshit no one cares about and actually talk about the issues that matter you know what the fact that women are stocked online why are they talking about it more often right is an issue that I think everyone could get behind right and like they like you said you know if a woman talks about being stalked men should be less dismissive a bit with all the information and narrative swirling around we still aren't exactly sure what happened we know she was a nice sweet girl that had a history of mental illness and self-proclaimed daddy issues sure she sought attention and affection online and heard a few people in the process people get hurt easily these days after all but did she deserve the ramp and stocking of orbiters did she deserve the creepy harassment and vitriol from frustrated keyboard Warriors who just didn't like her didn't like the way she acted then like the Things She Said all of this eventually leading to something she in no way could have possibly deserved an unhinged individual taking all of this hate all of this material and taking action with a knife we're left with wondering what Brandon's real motive was was he just jealous was he just mad was he really just another incel according to most everyone she wasn't his girlfriend he was just this Orbiter that festered with rage and killed her then attempted to kill himself luckily he sucked at it he failed and was taken into custody a day or two later he was released from the hospital and into the custody of authorities and now because of that we will eventually have a trial and we will eventually find out exactly what happened that's right Brandon survived his suicide attempt despite the gaping wound there is a order he was arraigned in court and charged with second-degree murder and was offered a plea deal to serve 25 to life but he refused and pleaded not guilty that means that indeed for Brandon Here Comes he'll and no there will not be Redemption we look forward to bringing you part 2 of this story once the trial has commenced in the meantime please please for the sake of the family Left Behind please do not seek out the photographs Unfortunately they are still available and highly disturbing that does it for this episode of Sword and scale part 1 of the Bianca Devin's story will see you in probably about a year for part two but don't stress we will have plenty of episodes in the meantime until next time don't be an incel I guess he can't help that actually so don't be in or about that and stay safe
