grandma everyone at what is up and welcome back to your favorite podcast ever pretty basic I really really is conceited sounding so everyone can tell that that is just my humor as I thought about writing something about your sense of humor know how to word this was so I just speaking of basically came up with this idea which I freaking love Halloween is start off with our game on my God spoilers and play Smile Back by owner Nelly do do do I need to tell you guys you guys are gonna love this I saw on the socials everyone makes fun of the fact that my legs just dangle now I see like I'm like what's life like today so we just came straight from a pretty basic shoot the most exactly to the day from last year we did our first three basic shoe and the reaction when she was like a month ago has been scheduled all crazy and then we just have to pick today and today was literally two days before lunch anyways so it was just crazy because neon yellow heels are like 6 in Think Like platform and I stood up and I was 5/8 with them on and now I know what it feels like for you all the time when I say I feel too tall cuz that's like the view is great but that's me it without heels so how did it start 5:00 in and I'm like that's a thing Netflix is making a movie just called tall girl looks amazing on I think Tammy like sent it to me was like LOL or something like that. LOL to be a great time and honor of one of my favorite pot our favorite podcast gals on-the-go must I must say first of all Danielle carolan is looking extra good lately have you noticed your Music Midtown have a dial look almost texted her but then I got it out there so I couldn't but it was like girl she's looking at you got and brothers but I'm sweating our logs and I've been watching her what's 1 as of today in 20 minutes you and George have a tail yes give him a shout out, shout out because of the we just talk about something like something great that's happened in the past week or maybe even two weeks cuz it's been awhile since we've recorded we're here last week we did too I think right now I don't know you were we weren't cuz I was on set always knew it so or two weeks or something good that's happened and then something not so good that's happened that would be a lot of the week so we can kind of like that's a game today not so much like fun let's do it but I want to go first I think you know when you always say you're striving towards something like one day I'll be there this past like 2 weeks I think I really like notice how much growth I've made in the word balance which was our word this year and like balance in my life and like many things like for instance normally I'm like working out like every every every single day like I will not miss a day like that's like I'm very like weird about that but like the past week I've just still been like Jet Li die feel like from Grease I've been very often like they were I think I only worked out like a lot of people is going to seem a lot like only three times compared to every single day like I think like four days when I was like slept in and like normally I'd be mad at myself but I wasn't mad at myself I was like you know it. Like I just need to sleep in like this is good and I was like oh my God like we're making a murderer this is great and then also balance of like you be so proud of me I spent a whole last Sunday 6 hours cleaning and decluttering my room closet in bathroom is she she never let a shame that she and literally was so weird because normally I have to fully work and get all my work done before I can clean like that's just how I am actually the opposite but that they specifically I knew it was bothering me and I was just like if I don't clean I will have a bad week like my my week will be off I won't get any work done so for the first time in my life I slept and I just completely like decluttered clean got rid of stuff that I've been meaning to get rid of for like over a year and it felt so good and I was like what what is this balance lifestyle I have going on like it was so it was really good guys thoughts was it's still clean so that's the Realty it's been a day or hasn't know it's been over a week 8 days I will. I'm very sorry no sorry if I don't know if just thought this would even just comparing a few months ago like just in many different things in my life whether it's like Fitness or just like cleaning chores like work I don't know whatever but it just funny feeling somewhat of a balance and it's just like good I'm so proud of you kiddo it's like it happened without even realizing it was past week after the 6 hour cleaning spring but I love cleaning the last night of the week I think was discharged this weekend was the best weekend of my entire life all my God I had so much fun and I felt also like I really deserves to have a good weekend because all last week Monday through Friday I was on set for a show from like I caught I was like six 6 a.m. I think of until like 12 or 7 p.m. and it was all like strenuous very strenuous activities something about shoots they're so exhausting they're so tiring but and exhaustion when I always have a migraine after I'm always feel like deplete like I feel like it's such a weird tiring than like manual labor working you want to think it's never going to shoot that long to also like lights and cameras being out like it is so exhausting so I can only imagine like a five never done a full week she like that it was it was rough idle lot of fun I made a lot of friends and it was a great time and I last time it was a really cool show I can't talk too much about it was great but after the Friday when we wrap apple cider to serve this weekend like this is what I felt like I truly just like worked for it and I feel like I understand our like Tommy you're like anybody is just like they go hard on the kids have so much fun because they work so hard. The week so I went out this weekend and we went to karaoke on Friday night with a huge like all these different groups that like normally go hang out together and I never even had met that man and I was like whatever, charity Carnival event thing or just like a fun time and I didn't like worry too much about anything else I just like had fun with friends made memories and that was my high the week / weekend well my love the week I'm kind of like frustrated with it because I have I feel like it's been awhile since I've been like struggling with that but like Mike side has an extra weird lately my head like just like the feeling and I don't want to talk about it too much because it's like there's really not that much to talk about it but yeah like it's just been more than normal so I don't know why but depressed hormones doing doing now I won't know I'm so curious to see after this. That I have how it will be as usual I feel fine and then I understand that's a whole other things right now I feel like I'm going to hold out about overall likes does like not that bad. I love the week I think is Iona go too deep into a bit like something in my life is happening where I really need to like step up and have a conversation with someone and I really don't want to and I was so scared to do so and it's but it's just kind of like sitting and it's just like everyday remind procrastinating and putting it off but it's not going to fix itself so I need to have that talk and so hopefully I will send well I am the worst at that so I wish I could give you that it's been a long time but I remember that was many things we talked about is how it's so hard for me to like like confront people are like stuff like that and then she was I forget what she said but she had said something along the lines of like it takes two seconds if we talk like instead of thinking about what you're going to talk about to say hey can we talk and then it's like already going yeah I don't have to worry about this like okay can can we talk like Jarvis I'm like not going to say what I want to do everything wrong see exactly but I'll get to it eventually I will then you got this I Believe In You on piano my God play therapy I'm stressed oh my God okay let's stop real quick because if you do not have the real real in your life you are living under a rock and your shopaholics off if you are one which I'm assuming you are cuz you listen to the song I searched you absolutely need it I love getting voice just love like luxury items are like nicer you know anything from like Gucci or Louis Vuitton or Cartier are all these like nice nice Brands but like sometimes you got your wallet hates you for it you know what time I want to know what the real real is it sleeting reseller of authenticated luxury Consignment from Top designers and they have everything up there for up to 90% off retail price which is insane seriously I got a Louis Vuitton backpack on there which I could not find anywhere else and I got it on sale or discounted rather it was amazing one of the hardest part about shopping online for a luxury or designer items is the fact that you just want to know that it's real and from that actual brand cuz there's a whole bunch of Fades out there so it's just so awesome that they literally will authenticate it for you also it's really cool I love to go back to the car one stop you always have to do when we have actual store that you can physically go into there's one in SoHo there's one in West Hollywood and there's the nearest location at 870 Madison Avenue in New York so once we go back we have as soon as I hit that went out and one of them about the stores is it's not just like she going into one Boutique of that Designer you can literally have all the different designers in one spot so you have a duty of Louis Vuitton you should now you don't have to go to all the different stores and you can still see them in person and it's so much easier I want a Birkin bag more than I want a I want a Birkin and they have in every sort of like a wall of them I've never seen that many of my life is just cool seem to let go so beautiful because in-store new customers receive an automatic $25 off at checkout so be sure to say that you're such a pain store online or my favorite download the app and get 20% off select items with the promo code real that's real. Com promo code for sale for 20% off select items can you talk about your idea for a J's of a sudden so I think we can do this in Greece correct did we not I think we've been talking about it for a while and our word for the year was balanced but I think I remember we did a recap like a halfway year episode four resolutions and we said yes the word is that where came up yeah the word intentional was our word for the rest of the year I believe I'll come back we just said this on her own but I pretty sure we said on the podcast at some point we decided balance is still the overhead kind of like a really good idea but the idea of being intentional where does a really good talk about angry and like every aspect of your life you need to be intentional whether it's like we're with work or with friends or even just like having a conversation with someone like being intentional listen to what they say nothing on your phone I think you might like what do I need to do today things like that like being touched with everything you have to do so we've been trying to apply that to everything and then my idea that came to me in the bathroom today was we should do so talking about kind of like qualities within each other actually started within ourselves that like we are either working or things that like we kind of value in ourselves qualities that we had that we really like but then I thought we should switch it and like I wrote down five qualities I really admire about Alicia and she did the same for me and I thought we could come to like spit ball them back and forth and kind of like talk about things that other like you guys are only know about answer maybe you do know it's like you know you could have shot him in deeper to like just called he's about ourselves because we also wanted in Greece we had a dinner and we are sitting up in 5 hours and we all went around the table talking about sunset sunset Tavern and so we talked about just like going on the table is the matter buddy channa mereya like crying so uplifting and people need to do that more often and it was also things like people said things about myself I like I never considered good qualities and same about using but everybody so I thought it'd be cute and fun to do stop love this. Okay you go first me first okay I'm great qualities about generic basic things that you'd kind of think of you with but after like truly knowing you knowing you I feel like I appreciate these things so much more so my first time that I have is that and I truly mean that you are the most caring person I've ever met never like ever can I see him ever and it's so weird cuz one of my how do you how they like that's amazing how do you do that because I wish I could be that way like you even whether it's like an ant on the ground a panda in a tree by a stranger leg no matter what like you care so much for like anyone and everything and I just think it's so I don't know like I hope you see that thank you she said she wanted to bring it out I probably will thank you I don't even know how do I collaborate on is that like do you try and it just normal for you cuz that's what I'm curious no I'm very highly likely scenario on the ground on fat I'm highly allergic to these guys and we were in Malibu and they were bees everywhere and Abby fell into the pool and I had to like go in and save it anyhow I was like freaking out because I didn't have enough you've had all of my God but yeah I know I just wanted to say baby I don't know if that has anything to do with it I don't think about it though I don't know but I think they're like that to know I think I don't like hearing what I want to be I feel like you're carrying all the time. I mean no but thank you I appreciate it I think I don't get the two thing to though it is you being an Enneagram type 2 I do believe that because it was a caring person but I just like like truly thinking about it you're like I don't think I know I'm more caring person in the world my my this is so nice I didn't know it's going to be so wonderful what is going to have a tip on like this is how you do this okay well but for some people like that's really hard for them to like not be selfish you know any why would you like a tip for that I think it would just be if you have the time I feel like a lot of times when it comes down to it it's like you're Puttin this like middle not a sir like a roadblock we like you can like help yourself first you can help someone else first and I think most of the time I try my best but someone else first unless it's like absolute urgent that I need to put myself first but also it at one point in my life I put too many other people before me and when I started to put myself first in some situations and I set that precedent it cost a lot of friction yeah so I think it's like I don't know being intentional figuring everything out like that and I think finding the backflow of like sometimes you to put yourself first but also sometimes you put other people first to will you inspire me because speaking of intentional which I feel like we should easily do a huge episode like a big sis episode on Justin tension cuz it's a common theme months ago as you go in like is wondering how you're doing or whatever and like using that made me realize that I was aware that I haven't had anyone up in awhile but like that made me aware you know and then I remember like driving or so and then I like thought I'd like Eli for instance and I had that I was in that moment run like I like I thought of him like why I hope he's doing good but I was like no I'm going to text him I like him when we had that that moment where you pasta tonight cuz she was like I just don't get like why I'm stuck like this likely she was like I'm not sure like what's holding me back and then I told her I think the difference between she and I is like if I think of someone suffer Danielle carolan I still feel bad that I've been feeling. Levator I actually feel bad I feel like if I think of someone like I do like reach out or whatever I see that's not such a foreign like it's not a foreign concept to me but it's definitely more times none that I don't like hit them up if I don't make action on it but I feel like you consciously make that caring effort to like text him and see how they're doing cuz you care you know yeah so you inspire me I've been texting people more than you have been I think that's great I let you know that totally makes our days to you know I was thinking about you. I'm proud of you my quality for you that I am so inspired by and I know everyone says but it's true as your work ethic and it's true I've never met anybody with those same work ethic you do and I also wrote down that I think in this world there are stairs and there are doors and I think you are a Duo through and through and you know it's I feel like it's similar to you have to say confidence in yourself of just like knowing like it's going to get done and there's no like way around it and like even if you put it on the back burner for a little bit like it will happen like even like your new merch stuff like I have no. It'll happen and I know it'll probably take a little while but I know you too you know it's just going to get done because you just like there's no other option I think you nailed it with the no other option but see what the thing is I don't know what you just said I don't know I don't know why I'm like that I'm going to know I'm like that but I would like to know why I like that I think it was all just stuff that we naturally that's what's interesting though cuz it's like that doesn't mean anyone can't have a good work ethic I don't know it's so interesting I didn't work at the can be taught that we can't be taught I did but then I guess like most I guess talents or whatever like you know half of it like can be taught and then there are just like a good singer was born a good to go get better so I think that's a huge thing that's really interesting I will say and this is I don't mean it in a like a conceited way but there are times where I like I don't doubt my ability to do something but I doubt myself like like it's it's me thinking I'm good enough to do it or like like if I decide and I don't regret that my parents always had said like even if you put my to anything you can do it like at all and so one that was a huge help to and then I just feel like I don't know it's only like if I want to have like a podcast friend since I'm like okay we're going to do it it's going to happen but then I'll second-guess like I like like what will people saying or like John about my actual ability to do the skill I have no doubt about that so that's what's really interesting I think also what came to me while you're just talking about stuff is that both of these where I never once for each other and I feel like that's probably our best quality I think in our own minds and also to everyone else other people see out of everything on this list also it's just like those were our natural and still nothing like what we know how to do without even thinking about you back on Friday I will say it's like it is just an I don't know it's just so interesting I don't know I like mine was more to talk about these things I know for sure I do think it's like sometimes I feel bad when people ask me how I wish I could like you would like to go to she's like I literally got up to today at like 8 because I was like Alisha Marie's already worked out by oh my gosh you work so hard like I would like I just hope I can be like it's so great we are also like I don't know how I know who I am and healthy balance of like me not having a social life or like the longest time in my life because I put work first or you putting other people first for yourself or your voice is a trade-off so again. Hope balancing but thank you I will say that's what does mean a lot for me doubting myself a lot so it is still here that like is like oh oh yeah I work at the top but I think Sayers versus Dewar's I think that's already sent so I do think I know a lot of stuff I know a lot of Fire and I don't know if my you doing oh my God thank you okay guys so Alicia and I are about to leave on a very exciting trip to Tokyo oh my God every time I tell someone they always freak out to like that's what I've always wanted to go so excited I love Tokyo in Japanese style in general to especially like the Harajuku style it's so interesting and like a street where is super cool so obviously if we're going I had to do some online shopping same income honey if you guys don't know what honey is it's amazing plug-in that you can install into your browser and it just makes shopping online so much better because it saves you money without having to literally do anything so basically there's always coupon code and promo codes floating around in the internet but what honey does it actually finds them all for you without having to look and it's automatically applied at checkout so you don't even have to physically type in the code I love shopping online because I feel like there's just a way better selection you have to like spend all your time going through everything and I was carrying heavy bags you can do it from the convenience of your couch is too amazing the best and then also I personally use coupons in-store I don't really stores also don't really take coupons like online there's always something that's like a grocery store yeah yeah yeah it did so great because all my coupons are just as easy to have to think about it and actually the average honey use your saved about $126 per year and that's like I don't know 25 cups of cold brew have airpods a pair of airpods at it half of half a college textbook which that sounds like college textbooks are very expensive we should do something about that or 126 one dollar Taco sure it is really no reason not to use honey it's free to use installed on your computer and just to class and I'll save you money so you can treat yourself to something nice. Com basic that's joinhoney.com basic for you is something that like I envy you need to learn from this girl ok you welcome everyone was not only open arms but like you would give away your apartment like if someone needed it like you are just you're so literally if I came up to you and had 10 strangers with me like they're coming over if you'd like okay cool leg how everyone my name is Robbie how are you oh my God your things can't like whatever I'm just like I can't do things when I feel like he's part of it is because you trust me so I'm bringing someone you're like I trust you I love you so I love them and I trust them so I think that's a huge part of it too but then also I think because you are just like a caring person like you're just like you who I like see the best in everyone until it's like proven wrong to you or something you know what I mean yeah we're over here and be completely opposite and even if I know someone it's so hard for me to like welcome them with open arms are like I'm just like more timid and shy with it all and I think that's why I sweat of everyone in the YouTube world like you have the most Riley just a friend and everyone knows for that like like I'm getting into some other point I don't know but I think that's just like you truly just welcomed arms for open arms for everyone and I say no thank you for a small I wish I was more like you though I do because a lot of times a lot of people end up hurting me a lot and I feel sad obviously because my feelings are hurt but then also the same time I feel so dumb I like you let it happen again like you I wish I could learn from my mistakes and things like that but I feel like when someone hurts you obviously it hurts but at least you're like a little bit more prepared for a little bit smarter about it honestly so I I try to do it I think I just kind of like for today I feel like I want to be best friends I love it so much like you make me realize like half of my problem of walking to him and looking down and laughs like I will no wonder I never liked talk to anyone or meet me one because I truly don't even like look and you're you you're just like walking tours you just like you just go to anyone and I love that even like when you meet other creators you'll go up and like oh my God your video 8 years ago with my favorite thing ever I was upset when my head like oh my God I want to see what the fan Girl by The Looking Glass right but I am become actual friends with them because you're being real and genuine and I'm like oh my God like it's okay to say that you watch so-and-so's video like anime mean of that yeah but I never thought about that when you put together this karaoke thing so many people got other friends and you were just like yeah bring them like so welcome and I would I feel like I was the one to do that the new friends would be like to me like Lila Katz is a new friend likes fraud and pregnancy I wrote something that you have been down as bich I've ever met and I didn't know if I too am a down bitch and like not many people in our world are another down bitch says you're a dumb bitch you when you are a visiting I will never prompt it I will never say hey guys let's go do this and even when people are like hey let's go like dancing this weekend I'll be like will not now but like back then I do like that like me what I wouldn't think I'd be like like more like I would wait for other people like someone be home soon I was going to say when I would watch your videos and like you had brown hair like this summer videos about to pull the guy neon saw you I would not think you were. Where you at where you then had no idea especially because I feel like I would do things that I want to do whether I'm by myself or not but I was just like page daddy X and like okay I'm going to go if anyone else wants to go to be fine and then I feel like over time and time again you be like yeah yeah they be like okay cool Ivy like a k o my God so that's that's funny and it's true I don't think many people realize that I think more like a little more strength through like with your personality showings for you and Contempo like before I had no idea that was when we were in Ohio okay sounds good on another example is like even just being grease for Haley's birthday like she was like what you guys go like expecting a reaction, we're going to be in Greece when do the next weekend but I put that you are so open and you wear your heart on your sleeve and I think that's beautiful thank you and I wish I could be that vulnerable breaking in about me it hurt like I don't know I don't like that and get it I don't wear my heart on my sleeve but there's just this like oh my God just like my heart's and warm thinking about it I don't know how to explain it like I truly think it's so beautiful and even though it kind of goes back to what you were saying earlier but like sometimes you get hurt and stuff I like I see that but I hope you see how like just seeing the good in people naturally and trusting them because like there is good in every single person you know in like choosing to see that like you do I think is so beautiful and I just wish I could say oh thank you I think you know it was crazy as I was thinking about this yesterday and I didn't realize like how vulnerable you have to be to put yourself out there to date I didn't like put it together until yesterday I kid you not why do you know I doubt it cuz you're like I can't get it I got it I kid you not I was having like a conversation with myself and I was like how in the hell did I put myself out there again and again and again and again but like I was sad for sure about some of them but like I don't know how I did it you don't you really mastered the whole dating like I remember at one point you're like a good date yeah I agree I see that even you like going on and all the time and just like you always have like a hinge date every single week and I was just like oh my God that teach me how I didn't think about how much like much I was putting myself out there until literally recently what's so crazy is I was going on like all these dates on these hand shakes all the time and just six so badly wanted a relationship and then finally I want but I'll let you know what I want to just choose me and if I go on a date it was like going to be for fun just to like have fun maybe get a free drink just like have a good time I can meet someone new to meet like lit just a gent like me a person like at school it's like learning story and I said whenever I go on dates it's very or what it what I would it was a very inquisitive I like I just want to get to know this person was cool and it when I went on my last handshake which I didn't know it was going to be late for however know however long was I genuinely like just wanted to go for fun I wasn't pressure for a boyfriend I was pressured to date someone just like I want to get to know someone what is it are you know when it comes to like I guess specifically online dating because you met him on hinges but I remember the day that that happened are the day before we are recording an epithet and you said like oh yeah I have a hinge date tomorrow and you're like honestly like I guess I'll go you don't give us very like whatever whatever every other day before I kind of figured that you were like oh my God I already found the love of my life were going to get married again and this time like a fast forward him actually being your boyfriend now I feel like that's a huge tip just to like Mema and you met this guy who is gray and it helped me the day goes so much easier and then fast forward now he's your boyfriend like honestly that's something that like really stood out to me that I really like so I was like check that's a tip for me taking notes and when you do, I think it's just like don't put pressure on the situation I love that and like I like hinge especially because I actually yesterday were talking or eating dinner I looked and I was like, he is like I mean yeah but honestly I always always go back to getting that first hinge message from him I don't know why but I was sitting right here when I got it it was just so weird is here where he remember screaming and reading it to everybody was like oh my god this is my dream guy because it was like all his reply to me was all of my favorite things that you're also all his favorite that you know what's funny yeah oh my God that whole paragraph about like chance or something we are the same and I feel like you wouldn't have been able to figure it out without those like prompting questions actually I think so and that like made it so much easier on the First Dates just like talk about stuff, and then the rest is history but yeah I think I don't know the weird like wearing my heart on my sleeve thing and being so open did come so naturally and I I think that moving forward with my life I think that I always will be there in a very open person but I do like that even though I was hurt by guys in the past I never it didn't change me for the future I didn't become like pennies like jaded or anything cuz I think it can happen from to yes.

Com pretty basic next on for you I put that you are always growing it open to learning more because I think there are so many people out there who may be like you're giving us like a situation like a task or something and I think a lot of people could just be like okay ABC I just followed a task list where I feel like you are very inquisitive and I feel like you asked a question to say why is this happening why am I doing this vs that like you always are just trying to get the most out of a situation I've actually talked about this with Tikka yesterday and you two are like the same person I was like you guys are just sponges and always like trying to absorb as much as you possibly can and that's something that I don't think can we talk I think it's because I know people who are just like do a b c d like that's so fine yeah but I think just as a human being that such a special skill to have till I just always be wanting to be the best version of yourself in any aspect of life I think one of my tips with that is I remember all throughout middle school and high school and I had no idea what I wanted to do and it was so frustrating cuz I was like well I'm decent at music but that's not my passion was like I'm decent at like feeder that's not my passion I don't want to be like a director like I'm dying I like writing but I don't want to be a writer so it's really kind of lost in that sense and finding something that you're passionate about like and comes YouTube something that wasn't even a medium format like then what I was like trying to figure it out became this huge thing now and it was all my interest in one and that's why I was passionate like and then once I found what I was passionate about then my sponge became a thing you know what I mean like I was like oh my God I want to like to know everything about like this Digital World wasn't even out I'm saying YouTube it just the whole social media wasn't even a thing when I was like in middle school and I was wondering about what I'm going to do like things now that aren't even out yet could be most people's whole profession so it's like it's not even let them stress you have to go back to the traditional like doctor dentist whatever like great jobs respect them but it's like your future career may not even be a thing right now so just like keep like expanding and like trying to find different things like Beethoven Club member also in middle school and high school is like what's the point of like sports if you're not going to be a professional athlete we're like now I'm like Oh my kids will definitely because we've learned so much like just respect for all those qualities and like even just like fun hobbies and stuff so yeah I think that would be my biggest hit because I used to not be that way but I understand what you're saying because I see that myself but yeah oh my God that's cool I didn't ever put that together but I love that okay next time for you this is something I thought back to you I believe that specific Ohio trip when you give advice this is also going back to intentional you genuinely are like listening like you it's almost as if the world stops for you which I understand how that could be unhealthy your world stops and I've never felt judged ever by you and you just sit like I contact listening like genuinely concerned and just like you're so empathetic like I can think you'll touch your chest all the time to just being like like like like when I'm talking about something I'm going to just cuz you feel it and like it like that is something that can't be taught like the way that you are just so like like you feel things for other people I don't know like that's so hard we talked about being intentional were like we're someone to actually looking at you like not like through you not like to see who's walking around or like what time is her like oh texting anyone like truly like undivided attention and I think that's so like so incredible and people that's so hard to find now and anytime I've like been talking to her venting to you even if we're talking for hours about me like I've never liked goes back to you like you'll give your advice of like this happen to me once but it's not like I don't know I just had friends were like anytime I say something I'm struggling with they only give their like Bubba Bubba Bubba blah and it still be in the back on them what I did earlier than to death but it's just so hard when you're like needing advice and that's something like you give not only the best advice but you're just like so empathetic and like I feel I feel like I'm not alone when I'm going through things just telling you yes I have much advice for this but I think the reason why I can only have a tip is just Why I care so much is because I love you with all my heart but it's true and like all I know is that one specifically I think it's just like I genuinely want what's best for you I do and I feel like I also like if you aren't in my life anymore I'd be wrecked but like let's say your life would improve if I were not in it anymore like I would sacrifice that for you and I mean like things like that like you have to cry is everyone in your life I think should be at like at these are just people I think I found the saying I actually recently one of my friends called me because they got rid of someone in their life and that was really making them not happy anymore and they're like you told me months and months ago like if you feel like anyone in your life you're walking on eggshells with get rid of it and she's like it took me a really long time but I finally got rid of it and I've never been happier if I think the actual thing I would think about a lot but just if there's anyone in your life who doesn't really have your best interest at heart truly you don't need them and they only do that when you when you're talking to me it's like whatever is happening to you with everything you said makes me sad too because I just want you to be happy all my God I've never met anybody in my life I think I know you're never met anyone my life we just like you're you're so level-headed and everything in like a situation where there A lot of times or I come to her do you know I'm going to go off on it or something times or I like obviously I tell you everything cuz you're my best best friend but I already go to you knowing I want a specific answer but I stopped I know you come to me I know it answer you want but the thing is I do this sometimes we're like I'll just stay what people want to hear I will do that and it makes me feel bad when I'm alone but I'm like oh but like I don't know what they want is it really hard but I love that you are just so truly honest and you also gives like your fare opinion I think to everyone I think it's like having to do with that trusting the beginning really tiny people and I give him too much. I think the fact you pull away from the beginning allows you to like level off a fair amount of trust with people I think that you're always use Fair judgment and just overall just fairness and everything I feel like sometimes I can be annoying cuz Ashley the same way and what I'm that person who's like this is so unfair blah blah blah blah she's like well maybe because I'm a mother who is so they can be like just tell me when I want to hear exactly allergy I feel like I do I make it very obvious I'm like yeah but that's what I want but then you're like now and I'm like damn trying to get better at like it's okay it like for instance this is how I see it if someone's like a so-and-so like hurt my feelings Bubba blah my initial reactions like they probably had a bad day or like or well I know that their intention probably wasn't that bad Bubba blah but like doesn't matter if that's what they did they mean sorry justify like their intent oh I've said this before you judge other people off of their actions but yourself off your intention but I think I judge a lot of other people off of their intentions which is not the normal case where I might have it in like really mean that deep deep down even though they hate you you don't have to like okay but that doesn't change the fact that like I hate you sometimes in the middle but I think it's interesting though I've never seen a case like you before where is very like specifically that like in the past with dating guys I have everybody be like so against her or so for them which ever made with a maybe and you would always be like almost the contrary I do you need that I can't have someone saying yes or no all the time I've always had a lot of friends coming to me for advice that's a huge reason why they want to hear but like let's like I give both sides you know Sophia present like a guy and I'm like well hear great things about him and hear bad things about him, most people would only see the good or bad he's like this and that's pretty shity but you know what he's a pretty like decent guy in this area where I like I think when it comes to dating was for liking like the good you know but yeah so that's been something I must replace you could be a counselor and I was like I think it's I think you get everybody a fair shot oh my God I love that I like seeing as a positive thing cuz I can easily see it as a negative I think it's great only going to happen all right my last song in this can be a good friend but this is funny cuz we're very similar with it you give and give and give and give with nothing expected in return and I feel like even in a different way so I can tell you really just get I think of tell me why your closet just came into my head like I pictured me and TK walking into your closet you're like oh I have 20 which one do you want are you doing you don't like these I'll post meet you a new one that's just like your love language and it's so crazy and I just I don't know I think that's something I wouldn't have expected about you until I knew you really like I would have guessed that you're nice and would like to share but like you're like so like literally anything like but you don't say it expecting it back or I feel like most people would obviously be like okay I'll let you borrow three dresses like keeping score or something like that and I feel like there's no scoring your head you're just like when bad at math thank you I put for yours at your authenticity I think that you and I like I've seen it through and through and I think I don't know the Alisha Marie that was in the pool with the Target bathing suit on the side like I didn't know you but I know you were still you I think you're just kind of figuring it out but you always had that like deep-rooted sell signs of yourself and I think being able to just see it grow more and more and more as the years have gone on has has been amazing to see and as much as you feel like you're thrown off sometimes and things like that like I just feel like you you know who you are and I think it's just such a beautiful thing oh my God thank you and I think alike and that's why I think a lot of your success from YouTube like your personality shows through and all of your contacts see what's so crazy to me and this is a whole other episode but like but I don't see that one as much and I've had people tell me that all the time they're like you're just so genuine and authentic and maybe it's just the word authentic sometimes I can like throw me your safe word I don't know I sometimes I'm like I get what people see but I don't know how I'm doing that yeah I think that's an even more authentic thing is you're just being you and it happened I think it's are trying to do it then it's that is literally the definition of disingenuine whatever might be like what am I doing like that is that and like just like I can get so caught up in that downward spiral so that means so much I think something that is interesting because I know you struggle with the whole separation between like you're working yourself but I do think a really good example of your authenticity and like everything like that and just knowing you is your brand I think that that is so solid and like that is one thing that you never question because you just know and that is you so I know it's like hard to separate the two but I also feel like with YouTube there is no separation sometimes it's so weird exactly but I think if Friday want to have a brand I think you've done a great job at it being you oh my god thank you so much I love today me to what a beautiful couple an hour but I'm inside those of you smiling cuz you laughing sweet and all I got to say just said he's our class that it was just you like
