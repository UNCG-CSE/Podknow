through this there was a lot of talk that they would check in on him and hope that that means somehow protecting him why would you have any court dates why would you have a court date coming up from This American Life and WBEZ Chicago its serial one Courthouse told week by week on Sarah Koenig Joshua was correct the state was trying to invoke his that's why I owe they wanted to send them to adult prison the morning after he called me and enquired over at the Juvenile Justice Center see what was what so I'm actually at the courthouse right now so they're just going to set a date for whatever is going to happen next but yeah how are you doing I was up all night last night I was thinking about last night but it's nothing going to be better if you don't get sleep stacking like your mother it's not my job to comfort Joshua certainly not my job to tell him to go to bed but I happen to be the one on the phone right now out of all the cases we watched Joshua's got to me most I could not fathom that the state would give up on him after all he dressed for law enforcement after the Beatdown scene absorbed a 19 year old kid I did what I know how to do I report it out every beat of this sucker every turn I spoke to Joshua almost every day sometimes twice a day for a year and a half so that the story of Joshua would exist not for posterity sake but for the sake of straight-up fairness first thing I wanted to know why Joshua what was odys saying he done that made the one who was ejected from their facilities and put them into the adult system I got a copy of the motion to invoke Joshua's syo filed by the County prosecutor's office at the request of the juvenile prison Indian River the mushroom claimed that Joshua created a substantial risk to the safety or security of the institution that despite all the therapeutic programming Joshua completed he consistently chooses to make criminal decisions then there was a list of about a dozen specific incidents just from the past 6 months salts fights disruptive behaviors it turn urine on a kid be throwing a remote control at a female guard he'd smashed a video game console ever find out the incident that triggered the motion to invoke apparently Joshua had put out a hit on another kid would usually means arranging for other kids to jump someone the kid wasn't sure but still the prosecutors considered it a serious threat I got to say I was taken aback by the list I had that anxious jolt of hold up have I completely misunderstood who this person is the list look bad the summer at the end extensive 16 fights 6 menacing threats 21 disruptive behaviors Etc but I have another report an internal odys report the documents every incident involving Joshua whether as victim or aggressor for almost all his time and odys custody when I cross-referenced the request to invoke Joshua's syo with that internal odys report I realized I know these aren't isolated incidents many of them are connected Interquest to invoke there's an assault when Joshua hit a kid on February 3rd what's missing is February 2nd which you can see on that internal report February 2nd that same kid walked up to Joshua at the water fountain and punched him in the face there are few sequences like this tit-for-tat sandwich only the tat was included in the request to invoke is that's why oh yes indeed Joshua did throw pee at the kid on March 27th the day before the same kid had assaulted Joshua answer key on him a common weapon in juvenile p I'm a list of Joshua's offenses by people who either work in ody is on behalf of kids inside odys and they said it's not great but yeah for a kid who's been in there three years it's not exceptional I don't see why is cardhu known Joshua for a couple of years she told me overall not a troublemaker not even on the radar in terms of major threats inside the facility he gets mad sometimes she said but usually for a legitimate reason Joshua did throw a video game remote into guard for instance Joshua told me that's because the guard discussed his case in front of other kids saying snitches get stitches he said she apologized later and they were cool after that but there it was in their quest to invoke another incident on the list sounded as if Joshua had caused a car to get hurt during a fight he said he was trying to defend the guard the one time I visited Indian River I met the same Garden passing she confirmed it he was trying to protect me she said she called Joshua honey again I couldn't interview anyone at odys on the record they don't participate in stories about specific youth but in a statement they reiterated that they do investigate allegations of misconduct and take action when necessary when I put the two reports side-by-side what I saw was the Raggedy morally compromised Chronicle of a kid at War wasn't only a victim nor was he only the perpetrator like a lot of kids inside odys he was both the most powerful gang in juvenile prison was after him felt like guards couldn't be trusted every day he felt unsafe to be created alliances where he could dominated where he could took advantage where you could stop protection where he could but didn't make his behavior right then again odys prisons don't really spin on an axis of right and wrong see previous episode prosecutors offer Joshua deal if you didn't fight the bind over and transferred to adult prison he get nine years if it went forward with the hearing put up an argument he could end up with more than that as many as 18 years stretch was assigned attorney with a guy named Jim whole flick done one of these syo invocations before that many people in the county had Joshua didn't know whether to take the deal with her for telling you if you want me to fight it he said he's inclined to fight it Joshua tried to Marshal support he has some odys staff members to write letters to the court on his behalf says if you told them they were willing Joshua's father who was in Jamaica pledge to hire Josh a private attorney just needed to arrange for payment in the meantime Indian River declare that it wanted Joshua out now while they waited for the final hearing on his that's why I owe the superintendent claim Joshua is causing an environment of constant response and panic Court magistrate okay the transfer Joshua was delivered to County Jail adult County Jail a couple of weeks went by and I can hear on the phone that Joshua was acclimating to the idea of an adult sentence in adult prison decompress the nine years in his head it really be six years since he's already spent a few years in ody us probably less than 6 if he was granted judicial release Bingham County with all these guys were getting walloped with big sentences Joshua had a fresh perspective on the number six one of like one casting a 17 years was a lucky break he's going to do come out with Jim houfek who played out the probable truth the today nine years was the best case scenario Joshua took the deal Dashiell proceeding was hard to stomach Joshua stood there crying a few of his umpteen yes ma'am severely audible. Rehabilitation during the remaining. Of juvenile jurisdiction is online I want point the judge ask someone to fetch Joshua some Kleenex no one had come to his rescue his father hadn't hired the private lawyer he said he was going to hire Joshua civil attorneys never did file a lawsuit on Joshua's behalf the Indian River staff until Joshua they'd stick up for him out for his progress not here I learned they've been firmly reminded you work for odys while we're at it where were the FBI agents would seem to like Joshua back in 2014 and I told him to check on him I got it was all too messy too much all those incidents on the list the context the Tit for Tat's the who started was too messy to look at old me sure we could have picked apart three or four of the incidents on that list explained fights on paper are more intricate than they appear but then what about the 40 other items teetering just behind they're going to be crushed them hoes like said for the sheer volume of incidents the one person who had shown up Joshua's only witness with Shayla Turner Joshua's Mentor from Freedom School she said Jim hopefully could contact her yesterday she thought she might be called upon to testify the trainer was upset I thought it could be fun. She said I really thought it could be fought and its letter to invoke Joshua's syo what do is it written that there was no more they could do to rehabilitate Joshua no additional interventions and treatments that can be attempted it is unfortunate they wrote that he threw away the opportunity he was given diarrhea that Joshua is unfixable was Turner said that part of it is complete Miss Turner isn't some wide-eyed Advocate she's worked with lots of kids in juvenile facilities her Masters in public administration with a focus on youth policy she's from East Cleveland to the deep and personal experience with the good and the bad of gangs that some of the kids at Indian River aren't ready to come out yet but they are still works in not quite enough progress Joshua though she said he is not one of the ones she most worries about and he's not one of the ones odys should be most worried about she does not accept that he hasn't progressed because to her Joshua at 19 such a far cry from Joshua at 16 when he was the Hot Head Eric and asshole did Judge Sweeney met at first that I met at Birds there's no doubt in my mind that that's when the conversation should have been had that conversation of should we bind him over like absolutely because he's becoming a threat to the facility and he was a child I thought could he be rehabilitated even had a question of the big guy had a complete question and didn't think that he could miss Turner said the only fight they had in Freedom School inside the facility only one Joshua his first week in the program he stood up on a chair and spit on somebody like I mean just outrageous even in conversation with him after that it was his arrogance to him it was this Cardenas and that's really doesn't exist in him anymore so tell now hear his conversation politely change to I want to get out of here I want to be a better person I'm asking to not be put into these situations I'm asking me put on a different unit Travis Smith crying out saying this is what I need I want to get out of this and you ignored that what most disturb Miss Turner it was Joshua whose ethics and behavior were being scrutinized and punished and now no one would look at what the state had done to him I think Joshua is the best case example of why it's so bogus when we have these expectations for kids to speak up about what's happening in our community have to testify and things like that and we see the ramifications and how we don't wrap around to protect that I think the biggest issue isn't that Joshua hasn't held up his end of the bargain is that the state has a note of theirs they haven't protected him having protected him from the gang he inflamed by testifying for the state more in a minute support for serial comes from rocket mortgage by Quicken Loans providing you with an award-winning team by your side through the mortgage process their goal is to make the home-buying process smoother for you with the history of industry-leading online lending technology developed in Detroit rocket mortgage is changing the game visit rocketmortgage.com serial Equal Housing lender license in all 50 states nmls consumer access.

Interest less stressful their Bingham County jail with a stress reliever did their jobs as far as you could tell people are nicer to one another more relaxed with one another more supportive he said he was noticing what I noticed in the shift from middle school to high school just because one person didn't like you that didn't mean the whole pod was against you it was something of a revelation to him even white people do okay in here he said. tell her it's my day say cool the other young man I'd spoken to Leo Malik Davon white kid named wave who been in both odys and then an adult jail that all agreed that it was dangerous as it was still better than juvenile less stress the same feeling less stress more relaxed with stretch out and hold true when Joshua arrived at adult prison he finally shipped 11.5 weeks after he been sentenced to a place called Allen Oakwood Correctional in Lima Ohio about a three-hour drive from Cleveland to his family couldn't visit but Joshua was just happy to be sprung from his cell because he cooperated and adult enemies lurk in adult prison Joshua was put in protective custody no heartless felons on his unit he wasn't shooting with other inmates are getting into it with CEOs Joshua marveled there were fewer guards yet the inmates had more freedom part of it was maturity he said people try to get home to their kids but the main reason the adult system was better he said was because it was harsher tighter less forgiving ship all around if you fight or act out through urine on a COS a severe does rain down still have that day or the day adult prison play you can lose your phone calls or your visitation and you could fester in the whole 4 months the whole especially major deterrent he said is the longest your health and seclusion is 4 hours for said juveniles take advantage of that shit to the max you are too if you were to propose Juvenile Justice Reform it would be that they should be stricter and I'm just not that you own a harsher punishment was better than levitate world had rotated a full moon 89:14 just buy me over I'll take my chances Corporation had gotten him nothing he said no real benefit three armed robberies in adult Court in word of time in the teens or twenties event he said look at my co-defendants half of them already out yeah you run your finger down the list of the 13 people named in the cut for tonight meant bunch of them got two or three years only a few are serving more significant sentences 11 years 13 years I've got nine to just come straight here he said said having my ass beaten odys for 3 years Joshua was in prison for 6 years taking for my purposes. His story attended but he kept calling kept calling and I kept answering I just took a 10-minute break in fact because he called me while I was writing these sentences I learned day-by-day what Josh was life was turning into on a cusp of 20 years old in protective custody lawyer police officers and the general prison population in a different building across the street cops never fully understood a lot of white supremacist Aryan Brotherhood okay I got a problem with them anyway you said you kind of had to get along the unit was too small for anything else turn your phone calls from Indian River Golf in here hollering in the background now from Allen Correctional I can hear the soft click of billiard balls that a pool table in the day room Joshua was the youngest on the party said he didn't feel like the adults around and more dangerous than adults in charge of the prison didn't feel like Joshua was dangerous what do I ask at a Joshua as a gang member but you said the game coordinator for the adult prison system how to chat with him checked out his history with tattoos did not pack him as gang affiliated on a scale of 1 to 5 5 being super max material Joshua was designated a level 2 prisoner sacrifice of being a prisoner in protective custody was the closeness of the unit and the tedium Joshua says he couldn't take advantage of some of the programs and apprenticeships across the street where gen-pop was housed it was feeling the time filling the time with people Joshua's intensely social is a talent for Gathering people pulling people towards him including people who can help him out like me I do I'm Small Favors favors the reporter shouldn't really do connecting him to the outside world mostly by three-way phone calls my most immediate benefit to Joshua was that unlike most of the people in his life I could afford an endless supply of Global Tel Link minutes continual contact usually it was family I became the operator hello grandson has troubles aren't news to his family obviously incarceration isn't news to them either even so it's heavy information when it comes to that what's up what's up man break my heart to get back to me about 12 you say it's right they live all over and Cleveland of course but also in Florida California Jamaica is on some cousins his parents his sisters his daughter and every call he tells them he loves them and they say it back I love you too baby have a call when his father was arrested by the DEA for conspiracy to distribute more than a thousand kg of marijuana in the United States sentence in federal prison his mother went to prison a couple years later once they were both locked up what happened was what you might imagine would happen to a kid longing for his absent parents he floated from house to house miserable probably the most stable person in his life is his grandmother she was his legal guardian they lived with her for long stretches growing up I put you in the back seat member by the time he was 13 Joshua begin to paying at the Juvenile Court initially for petty stuff being unruly fighting at school but I got more serious 14 he was caught for strong arm robbery and some friends among the guy they knew it was sent to an odys residential facility he escaped and over a wall with a friend and called his sister from a gas station pay phone to drove out to collect them when she was home heartless felons drug dealing guns some robberies in the Popeyes he was 15, 5299 Phelan place just after he turns his baby daughter was born in 2 months later the FBI came to get them hello how do you say sometimes in the calls it feels like the Master Clock of Joshua's immediate family is the criminal justice system itself the continual pulse of court dates and visitation forms and commissary money is recording these calls occasionally we discuss the content afterwards about his relationships is it open like that strikingly so I was rooting for him to call me just to call me I don't know why in case you're playing fascinating to tell me TV no way really yeah I got it he was relieved Joshua dressel with the language arts portion of his GED twice before former odys guard who Joshua is a younger teenager had described him as impressionable the kind of person who will do good if he's around good do bad if he's around bad adult prison is filled by and large with adult criminals I kept an antenna up for signs of Joshua might be listing for Darkness sometimes I hear a hard blade of anger in his voice he starts wearing or on the phone I can really tell what that meant maybe was just more comfortable with me maybe it's just in a bad mood on the positive side Joshua become friends with an ex cop on the protective custody unit a big guy who Joshua laughingly told me it was making his huge muscles even Huger working out all the time does ex-cop denayne Dixon from is Cleveland from Jesse Nickerson case the officer who taking Jesse to the park and pleaded guilty to a couple felonies as a result Joshua really like the name the new people in common and today like Joshua he's funny and charismatic to me and told me feels like having a little brother around I was interested in two names assessment once Joshua got out did he think Joshua could have an okay future one that didn't include Perpetual incarceration right now at this point because why treason I hated this answer because Joshua was found over he would now have an adult felony record Joshua knew that would react the most long-term damage to his prospects once he got out tattoos began creeping back onto his hands and neck and face all the places he had them removed before I spent many phone calls looking up people on the internet for Joshua people he knew from Cleveland who were in County Jail charges he was asking but they're going to trial ask about people who already been sentenced how long they get which institution to give me the inmate number tell me the zip code again who's writing to them making contact what time the people he was having me look up their cases sounded terrible a premeditated murder somebody shot and then burned in a car I asked him what are you doing like nobody is perfect everybody in this world made bad choices before it's rather they got caught for him or not send Indiana game just a ton of light like a light Air Bud he was being kind and I understood he was trying to give other people what he himself needed a reminder that he wasn't a piece of shit that he was forgivable redeemable he was taking a position for more Humane than the one the criminal justice system had taken with him trying to think for a minute about why I was getting angry I realize this community of inmates who was stitching together was worrying me for when he got out for a while so that I'm not falling back into that world and I think that's why I'm having this reaction which is it made people to understand me the most it's tempting to think that all of this prison and Punishment lead somewhere that there's a goal we can point to people commit crimes maybe if they turn their lives around a Civic reward awaits them back home but for someone like Joshua it's hard to imagine what that reward would be Miss Turner at Old name the young men she's worked with inside the prisons have been able to crack open their feelings make themselves vulnerable she's watched many of them come home and then crumble because they're back and violent neighborhoods where they need armor to survive she told me the most successful ones I hate to say the ones that are communicating that they actually feel Joy are the ones who went back to the streets Joshua knew it said it to me many times his only chance of survival was to never go back to Cleveland if he returned home he was going to end up hurting someone or getting hurt right back at the Justice Center the year we were in Cleveland 2017 more than 13,000 felony cases move through the Justice Center brutalist hour Downtown 26° High hundreds of people coming in every day wound up emotional baby watching a little TV will help them relax that was the idea when the court had TVs installed in the waiting area to know the court rooms on the 15th floor and older woman's weeping she Retreats into the ladies room I can hear howling in there she comes back out still crying a young man maybe it's her son is folded over head in his hands right above them the Food Network that's the courthouse soundtrack clean kitchen cupboards while stopped demonstrative judge auditioned other options the news too upsetting History Channel and boom there's something about the Nazis in the concentration camps you thought of Animal Planet Cartoon Network in the end the most reliably soothing Food Network it does lolyou you forget for a moment how much is happening all over this building in the space of a year all those thousands of cases begin here in the arrangement room crucial decisions are made in the arraignment room the judge choose as your lawyer if you can't afford one you can't usually assigned your case to a courtroom or these are Bond keeps you in jail or let you out really quite understand it doesn't have people are waiting their turn with this judge the bailiff is at the ready big pile of case holders fantasy ask you if you understand what the charge mean at the facts for less than asking questions slows the Rhythm Toyota TRD charges Raymond is the Justice Center intake valve the rush of cases now process they all wish upstairs into courtrooms to induce you to change your leg 13 of the three words that will button close many thousands of plea Bargains this year I know involuntary and intelligent fashion sure you doing this voluntarily voluntarily a few floors down judge Daniel Gaul just re-elected by the way tell the defendant to pull up his pants the guy's been in jail cuz never belt pull your trousers up and the case is yours you can decide 19th Floor a trials just beginning very selection the jury pool all white save for one woman is black and it at a law firm defense attorney starts asking her questions she stops him ready to participate in our legal system I have so much personal disappointment in the inequities in our systems ground floor in the hallway outside the doors to the county jail a crowd is waiting for a man named Evan King to walk out he spent 22 years in prison for murder he didn't do people are singing Crying then I see him exonerated play Radiohead. What are outside on the street police officers from all over the county in the state March in the annual Memorial parade turn to local police officers who died during the past year in the line of duty separate incidents but both hit by cars while working on the highway backup on 18 and JoJo Donald's courtroom sentencing the brother of a murdered woman gives a statement he talks quietly angrily for a few minutes so she's glad the defendant is going to suffer every day in prison and then he launches himself like a missile at the defendant another sentencing for triple murder in a barbershop to Capital case the court room is crammed relatives of the victims and of the defendant kill the gallery the media set up in the jury box there cameras and microphones Alvin Wright comes forward he was a victim in the case you've been cutting someone's hair when shooting exploded the shop yourself people in New get killed Robin Wright had testify for the prosecution at trial and now just before the judge issues her final decision whether she's going to sentence the defendant is 21 to death Island right addresses the court how situations fucked up how many guess what I'm dealing with though the judge tells him to court of law there's different words go ahead messed up situation do I agree with putting them down like a dog nope best Smith and nobody win you put it down we don't get nobody back nothing this is why would we just keep losing just black people. You just keep losing you got all these white people right here they looking at us like us like me in the zoo this real shit I went to the zoo driving I don't know, I'm just I'm just looking at the big picture up this look at this that's life we got to do better than that the best kept secret in the Justice Center is in the lobby it stuck between two pillars near the elevators looks like a wheel you might see at a raffle or bingo game but it functions as a suggestion box because I'm kites for the staff the administrative judge will get them he's got the key driving around this building for your I have many suggestions just off the top of my head I'd say go minimalist don't pile six charges on to a single crime when one charge will do don't overcharge to force a guilty plea don't like anyone up unless they're demonstrable violent admit the police officers lie under oath get out of the punishment business and turn toward the Urgent problem of fairness keep obsessive track of who exactly is being charged with what crime other set and shakes out and what their life looks like in 3 years or 5 years take over the color of their skin and how much money they have don't share what you learn in a drawer and forget about it don't be in sensibly tempted is Charles Dickens wrote into a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad course cops prosecutors judges lawyers call out the colleagues who degrade your profession in public defenders at least twice as much as you're paying them now judges stop choosing those assigned attorneys citizens mix up the bench stop electing judges countywide an overall slowdown doubt yourselves I know how corny the sounds but imagine that every person in the elevator car is part of your own family and reflect on the far-reaching pain of prosecution also don't in court that happened and consider getting rid of the grand jury I could cram that will to bursting but if I'm only allowed one suggestion I'd say let's all except that something's gone wrong let's make that our premise many times during a reporting in Cleveland when I'd ask about problems or reforms someone with throw out well let's remember we have the best system in the world kind of prosecutor Michael O'Malley said it to me I just think people need to realize we have the best criminal justice system in the world people who operate that system know about the wards and they can see we can always improve but generally they're not chomping for an overhaul the kind of Extreme Makeover that the data is screaming a test on her cake we've all heard the stats that we here in the United States in prison of vastly higher percentage of our population than any other country in the world we are number one but numbers are well-documented wildly out of whack and unprecedented in our history also well-documented inequity every joint in the skeleton of our criminal justice system is greased by racial discrimination compared to white people who committed the same crime and have similar criminal histories black people and other people of color are arrested more often they're charged more harshly given higher Bales offered worst plea deals they're handed longer prison sentences and a probation is more often revoked these numbers aren't floating above us in the sky they're alive all over the country with a good studies from New York City and Alabama in Wisconsin and Iowa 6th District and Hampton Roads Virginia and Harris County Texas to everywhere and all are courthouses reporters often hear that we only report the bad stories exaggerating sensationalize especially when it comes to law enforcement for walkie prosecution's but we didn't go to Cleveland and sift through hundreds of cases looking for the most egregious and justices we could find we didn't have to be ordinary one told us everything we needed to know churros produced by Julie Schneider Emmanuel Jyoti Ben Calhoun and me with additional reporting by Eataly uskoski
