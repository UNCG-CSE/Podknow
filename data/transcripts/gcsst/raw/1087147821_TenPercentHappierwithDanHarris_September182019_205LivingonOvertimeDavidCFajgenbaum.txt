Org events all right let's get to the show our guest today is dr. David fagenbaum and he was recommended by a previous guest Adam Grant who's a renowned author and psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business to Adam thank you for making this recommendation because it turned out to be great as you all are about to hear David is also at the University of Pennsylvania he is one of the youngest people to be appointed to the faculty at Penn Medicine where he's an assistant professor of medicine in translational medicine and human genetics he's also the co-founder and executive director of the Castleman disease collaborative Network Castleman disease you may not have heard of it is pretty scary disease and David happens to be a sufferer and he's been dealing with this disease since med school and this is an unusual episode for us because I don't usually do medical Mysteries and that's certainly what David stories all about he's just written a book called chasing my cure and which he Endeavors to cure this is little known disease which has been afflicting him the reason why I wanted to have him on is that even though he's really just in the beginning stages of his own meditation a career is that in dealing with this extraordinary Health crisis where he has nearly died four times had his last rites read to him with his family surrounding him he has come up with some guidelines some lessons for living that are scalable to the rest of humanity one of them is living on overtime which I'm particularly intrigued by I'm still going to talk a lot about that and and his other precepts that he's developed as a result of this ordeal also stay tuned for the surprise entrance at the end of the interview we we invite his wife Caitlin to come on in and share her views which is also incredibly interesting and moving so without further Ado here is dr. David fake email so at what point did you know things were dicey on the health front so I was a healthy third-year medical student never had any medical problems Michael Alig hadleigh College athlete play football Georgetown and treating patients at the hospital that I was a medical student at and all the sudden you started having night sweats and fatigue and I just wasn't hungry at the abdominal pain and it things I wasn't that sick yet but I have the sense that there was something really really bad that was happening to me I didn't know what an over the course of the next couple weeks I got more and more tired and unfortunately just kind of started noticing fluted accumulating in my legs and strange things that didn't seem normal so I went from a medical school exam that I took and I went walk down the down the hall to the emergency department and they did some blood work and said they would your liver your kidneys and your bone marrow are not working we need to hospitalize you and that was the start of what was a frightening 6-month. Tell me about it yesterday they hospitalize me and I became really really sick really quickly I had a retinal Hemorrhage went blind in my left I gained about 50 lb of fluid I had liver failure kidney failure I was on dialysis all with no diagnose someone from the southeast medical student all of a sudden literally dying in the ICU that I was a medical student and I was so sick that actually the doctors encouraged my family to say goodbye to me and encourage them to fit kind of prepare for me to die so they called in a priest that happened they call Dad we said goodbye they called me three times and then a priest came in and read my last rights to me and I'm unfortunately we didn't think that I was going to survive on the right around that time they did a procedure to diagnose this mysterious disease that's called idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease and they started me on chemotherapy right away and the chemotherapy kicked in just in time and I survived that first deadly episode but unfortunately gone on that multiple relapse it's just to be clear in my own mind they three Good Vibes happened in that first episode or happened I kept getting the exact number one on the first time you're saying goodbye to your family that that most people don't get to don't live to tell the tale quite literally tell the tale what's like a what's it like in your mind when you were you think you were convinced you have been told you are dying you're saying goodbye to your parents and your sister it was it was frightening it was I was so sick that I might my brain wasn't working all that well because of the kidney failure some at my thoughts were not totally clear but I never being terrified that a blessing I think so I think each time I've all five times I've almost died I've been so sick that maybe maybe that is a blessing that maybe I haven't been able to think so critically but I do have or there's one thing that has been burned into my memory and that was after the last goodbye and kind of I settled in thinking that I had ours remembered looking back on my life and thinking about my life and when what I done and I didn't regret a single thing that I had done or that I had said I only regret the things that I had not done had not said in that I wouldn't be able to do in the future one of those was that might my girlfriend. Heard the person I dated for a few years we actually broken up just did a few months before I got sick and so as I kind of settled in thinking that I would die anytime now I regret it that I hadn't fought for our relationship I regretted that I hadn't told her how I felt and that was one of these for Crest that and I wish I had done this and and when all the sudden to chemotherapy save my life I kind of promised myself that that I'm going to live this life where I think it do it was my motto or it's like I'm not just going to think something about how I feel about someone about wanted to do something if I think I'm going to do it and I'm in Caitlin now my wife we ended up I told her how I felt and despite all that is going through we got back together but there's a scene in the book where you actually describing white granular detailer you or your belly was distended because you had excess fluid you would lock your hair from the chemo and she's sitting next to in your bed and your wanted to get back together but thinking you you have a kind of kind of legit body dysmorphia is going on you just walk us through that scene he has so that's stage I had spent almost six months hospitalized I had nearly died three times in that six month. I'd multi-organ failure and I just started to come out of it I was now out of the hospital and in Caitlin was there with me and it's the first time she'd seen me since I first got him sick and I wanted with everything inside of me for us to get back together but I didn't want her to know how badly I wanted I want her to know that that I loved her and I wanted us to get back together but I wanted this to be her decision and I remember you saying are you sure but he not I'm so sick I don't know what my future is going to look like and remember this look that she gave me which was are you crazy of course you know I want it I want to do this and and I thought to myself I think you are crazy and that you'd want to get back together in the midst of really what was a frightening. And you said something that I've struck me that you it's when you're sick kindness is nice but it also when you're really sick this kind of kindness of somebody ex-girlfriend getting back together with you you really start to figure that she's doing it out of guilt you worry absolutely worries out of field you worried that it's too kind of make this dying person feel better about what they're going through but Caitlin managed to make me feel like that was not why she wanted to get back together and then she's kind of demonstrated that since then but that was my fear the time I didn't I didn't want this to be kind of you know just to make this time and feel better what is this disease idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease multicentric Castleman disease yeah it's it's it's basically kind of like a cross between an autoimmune disease and cancer so basically your immune system gets completely out of control and then begins to attack and shut down your vital organs say your liver your heart your lungs are kidneys rare very rare about five thousand patients diagnosed each year in the US which is about as common is ALS so it's it's rare but it's it's maybe less well-known and other diseases that are similarly rare actually didn't know Alice was that rare ya hear about it a lot he's actually start thinking you could happen to you so devastating search for that I'm so happy that there's been so much awareness for it and unfortunately they're also diseases like castleman's radio Pathak multicentric Castleman disease also quite deadly also rare on Buttman do we need to push for it on the standing of it so you say you got back together with your Xanax now wife after the third time you nearly died so then she was with you for two more yes it at that time I was started on an experimental drug that we all hope is going to be the treatment for my disease and it wouldn't come back and I went back to medical school I finished my 3rd year Medical School Caitlin and I were together during that time and then while on this experimental drug I had another relapse I was back in the hospital with all the organ failure and it is staged this is the only drug that it was in development only drug detection ever undergone development for my disease and I learned from my doctor who's the world's expert that there was nothing else coming down the pipe there were no promising leads and there was no one doing any sort of promising work to get us anywhere and so I remember turning to to my now-wife and my dad and sisters who were in the room with me and my hospital room in and I told him I said I'm going to dedicate the rest of my life however long that may be trying to cure this disease and I was so sick at the time that I think they were kind of like okay Davey night sounds good but like let's just get through this but that was a commitment I may I survived Got7 age and chemotherapy Sosa combination of seven of the worst chemotherapy drugs out there but that obliterated my immune system in it saved my life and sorry I survived that but now I knew that there was there was no hope if I if I wanted to hear if I wanted a future with Caitlin future for my life then and I needed to turn my hope for a future into action and that's why I left when I survived thanks to chemotherapy I left the hospital on a mission and I've been running full speed after this disease since then what how much progress have you made we made a lot of progress so actually see when I was when I first became Hill there was no diagnostic criteria they were in a treatment guidelines of her new FDA-approved drugs and today since then I started a foundation call the Castleman disease collaborative Network and then I began conducting research on my own samples at the University of Pennsylvania we developed the diagnostic criteria Woodville treatment guidelines there's that one FDA approved drug and what I'm really excited about that drug was the one you were taking that's right that didn't work for me and it at 4 for about a third of patients but for patient didn't work for you but and yet you survive you survive because you did the seven agent came out exactly is this one drug and then the nuclear option exactly but what I'm really excited about is that so unfortunately I went on to have a v a v a r e f f one of these flares and in Caitlin of course was there with me throughout but with number 5 and I also approach that again when I got out of the hospital I'm I dug into all the data I had generated over the previous year in the lab and I did a digital experiments on my samples and I found a drug that I thought could help me it was a drug that was developed for kidney transplantation 25 years ago had never been used before for my disease but I'd run out of options and nothing was working I couldn't continue to have these deadly relapse is with would nuclear chemotherapy basically and I'm back in February of 2014 when I was recovering from number 5 I decided to start my cell phone this drug that would have never been used before for castleman's and it's now been five and a half years that I've been permission on this drug so I had five of these players in the first three and a half years none in the last five and a half years and now we've gone on to start a clinical trial at the hospital that I work at to give destruct other patients other patients don't get better on the approved this was a pre-existing drug on a new drug that you threw your research realize could be useful for castle with exactly 5 and 1/2 years how confident are you that there are no more relaxers in your future I'm not confident at all I I I live knowing that it's been 67.7 months that I've been in remission and then and I realize I can't round up I don't know if I'm going to make it to 68 months without a relapse and and you know where the future but I'm grateful that this drugs got me this far and so I run a research lab at UPenn where were fully Focus identify new treatments and a cure for this disease and like I said I don't know that this drug is it a I hope it is but but I also know that there's other patients who actually who don't benefit from the one at the approved drug and they also don't benefit from this drug so we need new options for these patients is that sort of Sword of Damocles that's hanging over you is that terrifying or invigorating or both I think that it's it's both and I think that it's it's it's terrifying invigorating it's also inspires action so it makes me realize that I need to work all day everyday to Advanced research for this disease because it's not just a sort of form I had a sort of a lot of other people's hadn't hasn't and I have the opportunity based on the laboratory I run based on the work that I've done to really make a difference and so it it's motivated me and I think that because I spend my time fighting this disease and trying to push for the science I know that if and when it does come back that I won't have any regrets I will have known that I did everything I could possibly do to fight this disease do you know how real is the progress me or just one lab Pharma involved here like Firepower is being brought to bear on this and how real is the progress Firepower why so we've invested about a million dollars are for the last seven years and to research which as you know compared to a lot of other diseases that's it I drop in the bucket but we've invested it really efficiently and so does that million dollars into research has resulted in an additional seven million dollars from external funders Pharma in Pharma Academia and Elsa Government funding and so we're kind of making every dollar goes far as we can in the way we do that is I'm kind of a Innovative a revolutionary approach to research where we don't raise money and then invite researchers to apply for I'm just kind of the typical way you raise money and you invite doctors and researchers said you know how we use the money we actually Built This Global community physicians research and patient and then we crowdsource the best ideas for what research should be done and then we go out and we Recruit new people have never even heard of Casa masa for new researchers to do cosmas research we find the best people in the world for particular study and then we give them funding and also samples and that sort of a go to rather than like waiting and hoping for the right research with the right time to figure out what is the right working going on recruiting week we feel like that's really improve the efficiency of progress and what's the state of play me how how close do you think you are do either a cure or new treatment I think if we made a ton of progress but I think that you know we have to see how this drug doesn't is clinical trial we're going to give it the drug I'm on 224 other patients and we're hopeful that it's going to work for a lot of them but unfortunately times and have to tell as to how durable this drug is I'm for treating patients been since I've and a half years for me but like I said I don't know if it's going to help me through the end of the month so we're just constantly pushing for it sinus or constant looking for other drugs like I mentioned before that might be approved for something else but they might be able to help castleman's patients and then this is a really important concept bigger than councilman's and that's their 1500 drugs already FDA approved for something and there are 7000 diseases they don't have any FDA-approved drugs so the really important question is how many of these $1,500 the FDA approved drugs might actually be treatments or cures for disease that doesn't have any options in this drug that I'm on the saving my life. I think it's a great example of that on the show don't generally do medical mysteries in your usual guests for that reason at all so that you you're not you're not yet really deep into meditation although it sounds like you're starting but why why I / we wanted to have you on is that the book is filled with a lot of meditation is a form of training the mind there are other ways to train the mind and you as a consequence of this ordeal I've come up with ways to train your mind that I think are scalable to the rest of humanity so I wanted to go through some of these you mention one of them which was think it do it that's right I should go back and say more about that sure absolutely so I think that I'm in and reading your most recent book thinking about that than they say or that kind of love in the back of your head and sometimes I'm either tells you not to do things or talked you out of things that's a very kind of a real connection here would think it do it work sometimes we think about doing something we want to tell someone how we feel about them we want to do something for someone that we love and somehow we talk ourselves out of it and then so they could do is to say that if you think about something that you want to do and it's important to do do it don't don't you know wait for this sometime in the future when X Rider hurt you'll have you know something's better do it and I think that this is a concept that I kind of had to go through having my last rites read to me and it nearly dying this is after the third time I nearly died were just became so clear to me that you need to live life recognizing the kind of all the overtime I've been using the analogy of overtime describe what I've gone through on that unites I had this extra time I didn't think I would have but in overtime every second counts you know you can have a bad play in the first quarter and you can makeup 13 overtime every second counts and you need to really live with Clarity and purpose and I think that there so many parallels here but to be between in meditation we can get to a state where you feel Clarity and recognized that you can kind of see through the waterfall and insofar here with and in my experience it took nearly dying for me to get that experience but I think it's something that has you said to be scalable would think it do it your you've made clear it and what I've read that it's not like okay so the voice in your head comes up when I D like yeah eat you know that 85 bags of Doritos or whatever it's more like if you think it and then you use your innate wisdom tooth that's exactly what it is in line with that and similarly another kind of monitor taken out of this is to turn hope into action and what I mean by that related is that oftentimes we hope for things in our life we pray for Things We Wish for Things and sometimes we stop after we hope we pray we wish and we we kind of hope for those things to happen but what I learned was that I hope that someone would figure out a drug Forum I hope the progress we've made and I was even the medical soon I was going to kind of semi prepared but I hope for the first almost three years that that someone else would do it for me and then I realized that if I hope for it and if I wanted it to happen I needed to do it and so I need to say if there's something I'm hoping for something I'm praying for that means it's important to me and so if anything that should drive my actions that should make me say I'm going to bed do something about what I'm hoping for and I'm praying for and then the third one that I want to bring up is this concept of creating Silver Linings so in life when we get through tough times we sometimes look for a silver lining you know what was something positive came from a really tough experience but what I've learned it is sometimes even more powerful is to say I'm going through a really tough time right now what can I do what can I create that would actually make this a positive but I think what you done with this podcast and also with meditation to the perfect example you went through your own personal storm and difficult time and you've created a silver lining it it wouldn't have been here there wouldn't have been the Silver Lining you could have found but you created this movement in your creating a silver lining out of the challenges that you went through and use it you can guess what you were trying to do or with this book Chasing my Keurig bring bringing awareness not only you actually Chasing The Cure in the lab and also bringing broader awareness to this disease absolutely the suffering that I went through my family went through with nearly dying 5 times and going through all these these difficult periods if I can share some of those lessons with other people and they can inspire people to turn their hopes into action that is a silver lining that wouldn't have been there without this book let's talk about keep keep going on the lessons you've talked about overtime and I which I think is a really compelling idea but I just wonder like how are you to sustain that urgency now five and a half years in no I have not had my last rites read to me but I've spent quite a bit of time in Hospice at I do quite a bit of meditation where the and end in the Buddhist tradition where you really thought to contemplate death in the impermanence of everything and yet I spent the last 24 hours literally worrying about something stupid going Lee stupid but it's it's not life or death and it does take me away from I'm not living in overtime okay are you able to really do that all the time to to be you know sort of present and feel the Earth do you know what Obama used to call the fierce urgency of now or do you fall back into getting caught up as we all do in in nonsense you know I think that so far I have maintained this real sense of urgency I think that you know every time I touch my chest I feel the port that's why my skin that puts chemotherapy into my heart when I relapse you know I I feel scars in my neck from where I had catheters to give me dialysis I you know sometimes take a deep breath and I feel some pain from the deep breath in my lungs from fibrosis from work fluid it accumulated and so I look healthy and I generally feel healthy but I'm constantly reminded whatever you beat breath I take I'm constipated every time I touch my shoulder that that there is a disease Brewing below the surface and and whatever else realizes there are many others with my disease that have a similar have a similar experience and so I think that I maintain this focus on but I actually am really excited about using meditation mindfulness tip to help help me cuz I imagine you know I never thought that I would have survived this long I'm now at nine years since my diagnosis most patients don't make it even close to as long as me so I didn't think at this needed to be a marathon I thought this really was his friend, because I spent it so hard and I found a drug that's taken my life now I need to maybe start thinking about it being more a marathon but but I also hesitate to say that cuz I found it every time I thought that maybe you know I'm in the clear that's when this thing is come back and so I'm trying to keep your focus and I think my messages is a tool that could help someone like me is no question about it and you may even look at the deep end of the pool to around Buddhism you don't mean my phone is it is a great technique for being more awake in the present moment for lack of a list cliche Turman us a great technique for not being so yanked around by whatever am oceans are swirling a random thoughts or urges but do you know the deep end those who've exploring what Buddhism has to say which again when I talk about Buddhism I don't talk about it as a religion for sale though it certainly is practice has one but more like the Practical techniques and philosophical views of the Buddha if he existed or whoever was right whoever said all the stuff that you reported to have said he is incredibly interesting and there's is a lot in there about death because that nobody gets out of here alive that's right yeah I remember there's a quote in your in your most recent book about how I think you said Buddhism is not something you believe in it something you do you say that because I think so much of my book and what I'm I'm sharing trying to share with the world is that a lot of things get trapped inside of us in some things we think about and hope for and then something never get done and I think that what I learned from having my last rites read to me and we just my dear. Death experiences is that it's the doing the things that you get to do when you get to say that you really they're powerful to you when when you say goodbye it's the things you didn't do what or you didn't say why you were here and so I think this idea of you know things that you think about things that you hope for you pray for thinking about how you turn this into action and make them something that you did in your life so you don't look back on your deathbed and say I wish I did this I wish I said this reminds me of I've been doing a story on a mom in Mexico who Mexico there this massive crisis of drug violence in their tank at a minimum 40,000 disappeared unsolved disappearances and the government has not until recently they're starting to get better but they haven't done much of the looking for the bodies or even trying to solve the cases and so I met a mom down there who we've been profiling whose son was a DJ and she was a college professor anyway you went missing wasn't even connected to the drug trade and she has been leading the charge to find him and she's gathered all these other moms and they literally go out and they gather tips in like dig and find they found a mass grave wow incredible and I remember she said something to me she speaks perfect English as it happened so we can communicate pretty clearly she said something to me like never turn down an opportunity to spend time with your family and killed for me because there are times when like I have to do work or whatever but it is on my way in the last couple of weeks for example I blew off work quite a bit to spend time with my family because they were at the beach and I wanted to buy would leave the city and Goten and it has it has it's the wisdom that people who have gone through something horrible can pass on to the rest of us she had done for me what you are trying to do this book you think they does that sound right to you it does I think that what she said to you and the message you sharing is so important also the message of what she's doing to try that you notice all these these murders to find these Mass Graves she hoped that someone would do it at some point she realized she had to stop hoping and start acting right and I think I think these are both such an important lessons and then you know what you said I'm about your family something I struggle with just as well I now have Caitlin and I we got married and we now have a one-year-old daughter Amelia she turned it one year last week and so I struggled because I'm in this position where the more that I work the closer I get to answers and solutions and maybe even a long life with with my family but the less I work the more I get to spend time with him in the short-term inside this constant balance just you know if I work harder I might be able to spend time in the longer versus short-term that stuff it's really deal with that it's really tough I think that I tried to make the time that I'm with my family so I try to make it really count and make sure that I'm fully present when I'm there and make sure that they basically what I do is either in a work towards a cure or spend time with people that I love and then try to get rid of all of those directions what is a Lucy said to me the next can mom was that she she went through a period after her son she doesn't know that he's dead but that she's pretty sure he is going through a horrible. Of depression and you know had trouble getting out of bed and then she started to get energized around looking for him and trying to going to probably not very energetic police to do something about it and then we'll really energized her was creating this network of other moms and she she described how she basically is not living for herself anymore which I hear Echoes of that I found it when she said it to be very powerful that she has in some ways in some ways that actually gives her a sense of lightness transcended the self do you resonate with you one hundred percent my books called chasing Mike here but it's not in my care that I'm chasing it is our care and it is our innocence of castleman's patient is also no sense of any rare disease patient you might have a disease without of a solution and there might be a drug for them and so that's sort of purpose and you know it started out personal and then when all of a sudden you can make bigger than you know what you're personally going going through it adds so much power and energy and you can think of that could kind of like weight weigh you down and make you feel you know like you have this in a heavy burden but it it's really I think I think it did it does add your life and energy show it to anyone going through that the other parallel Which Wich or which really resonates with me so I lost my mom to cancer while I was in college out she was diagnosed just before my freshman year and I really struggled with her illness and death and then just before she passed away I promised her I would create an organization in her memory tell father grieving college students and I didn't know what that was going to be here what it was becoming a really was for me at first I was like my own grief I want to find other people that I can connect with but again the same sort of thing once this network started spreading around the country and now there's this chapter is all over the country I found that connecting with and supporting it and making my mom's Legacy her initials or her name is Andrea Mitchell's organizations actively moving forward to also a math and idea that her life is helping people in the AMF is supporting people now 15 years after she's passed away gives me so much satisfaction and helps me with with really challenged increase that I dealt with yeah I mean it's kind of in Buddhism is a lot of talk about the self being the source of our suffering that end it end it that the self is an illusion that we we have this primordial illusion that there's some David back there between your eyes there isn't and what emerges from this illusion is greed because you want David want stuff hatred because David has Rivals Isadora David has people who drive down the road he didn't like the way they're driving and confusion about what we really are and who we really are and what I what I bet that's pretty heavy stuff I think a way to put it that I think would be much more relatable is that focusing too much on yourself doesn't feel good self-centeredness doesn't feel good and even when you were in a horrible situation like you were when your mother died or when you had last rites read to five times or when Lucy lost her son there's something actually liberating and that's a big word but I think it's true when you aren't so focused on the south and you are an outwardly focused and your life becomes bigger than just your desire for a donut I'd I totally agree I think I think that's Bigsby exactly the way it is very liberating it's that you know you've sometimes you go through life thinking that there's certain things you have to do it maybe is good for your good for you and you just kind of go through this log of life, but I think that you know when you have a life event whether it's a death or or a serious illness yourself it helps to kind of focus you on the things that are really important for me it's my work and it's the people that I love and all the other stuff people who drive bad in a bad way down the street that doesn't bother me it it's about you know it's the things that are so critical because all that other stuff doesn't matter when you're when you're on your Deathbed let it go back to overtime in the idea of you know every second counts as it's easy for you to remember because all you do is put your hand on your heart or or take a deep breath probably doing even more than putting your hand on your heart and you feel it and I talked about in the show a lot which is that through meditation or through Buddhism research spirituality mean spirituality we are we hear a lot of inspiring stuff but we are programmed for denial or program to forget that we're going to die and to be super focused on the next donut other than a sandwich or the next movie or whatever for good reason because of on the savanna we survived by finding food and sexual partners in avoiding the saber-tooth tigers that that's how we have this voice in her head so we need to be reminded and in fact the original translation of the word mindfulness and it's ancient in in the ancient Indian language of Polly the word was Sati that word means recollecting so remembering that you're in overtime is incredibly powerful LED is the game this may be an apostle and question for you to answer but is there a way that the rest of us can remember that we're all effectively get overtime we don't know it but we are so you're right I think that is a hard question to answer but I think that it is through hearing stories from from people like you and I it's from hearing from your friend who sharing her story about what she look has learned through her like I think that if you can can you put yourself in the shoes and say you know what I see where they're coming from I get it here these stories I think that you can kind of like kind of store those memories away and remember that we are all in overtime like I said before early on I was like oh my gosh I'm in overtime you know every second counts and then and then I started realizing now we are all that overtime you're none of us know how long how much time we have and I made it

Com happier can you remind the wisdom of fagenbaum hear another thing you another their technique that you've come up with post diagnosis is your 40-minute walk to work in the morning and how its it has meditative component can you talk about that if for me it's it's the walk to in though in a walk home it's it's my chance to start when I'm going into work to start getting into a mindset that that's ready for a full day and I'm out of the in my evenings when it's coming back it's getting ready to move from that that work world trying to cure my disease is to try to make every second count with with my wife and my daughter and so it's kind of like my reset in both directions you know moving from this high before I have this almost like a non-polar challenges words he knows spend be there present with my family that I love but also dry Ford signed so I can be with my family in the future and so I think for me I have to really it's hard for me to break in and pray down so I need that 40 minute walk to the break from you know kind of 11 David to the other yes what I hear they are you just tell me if I'm right is like the this is going to be up there and but you know we need we need to take care of ourselves as a kind of self-care which a little bit of bug turn right now but we need to we need to have moments of reflection taking care of ourselves and moving skillfully and thoughtfully from one phase of our life one mode or in a professional the personal mode in this helps you do that that sound like an accurate summation that's exactly right and and I've kind of been I guess maybe by trial-and-error I figured out ways to make it work better or worse, along the way but I actually am pretty excited about being able to start to introduce some mindfulness practices and I just I've been kind of going going on the Fly I'm with those 40 minutes. I'm excited that my sister have sharing with you earlier my sister told me about podcast about you and so I'm excited to start introducing some Lucinda. 40-minute walk and I'll have to tell you how it goes clearly your sister is a brain that's a great idea I really do I am not going to tell you I think clearly whatever you're doing is working a standing in the room with you but what is there there's some Zen expression everything is perfect but it can use a little Improvement that I'm sure your walks could could be improved by that Ledoux let me know how it goes well another another thing you found to be really helpful on this may seem obvious but I think it's hard for people to do in extremis when when things are bad is humor about the importance of humor to my mom's illness and then also threw my own I'm just how critical humor can be sure a couple of examples so my mom had brain cancer and when she went in for her first surgery I'm we didn't know if she would emerge the same person as before husband before the surgery and when the doctor told us we could go back to see her in the waiting area we were off so scared and who is this going to be our mom when we get back there I'm a large portion for brain is taken out and we got back and open up the curtain she had a wrap around her head and she had a bulb coming out up where some fluid was collecting and she looked at us and she said Chiquita banana lady burst into tears we laugh so hard you know we didn't know and this this is our mom is who she isn't and she she was saying that cuz she knew we needed that and so we needed the humor to say oh my gosh are moms with us and so fast forward several years and then here I am in the hospital I just spent almost six months hospitalized now it almost died three times and I've got in the 70s and chemotherapy so now I'm feeling better and it's kind of crazy to say but the chemo actually made me feel better every dose of chemo cuz I'm so sick before and it was New Year's Eve of 2010 and that evening my Dad decided to go for a walk around the Hematology Oncology floor and we passed a gentleman who has kind of swinging his Cherry look like you've been drinking too much in New Year's Eve and her next lap around we saw that you fall into the floor and semi dad helped them back up into his chair he looked at my dad and I and he said thanks so much good luck to you and your wife and I kind of looked her husband wife was he talking about I looked at my belly he thought it was my dad's pregnant wife walking around to deliver our child and we laughed so hard and you can imagine that I could have gone a couple different ways to get a gun oh my gosh this guy thinks that my dad's pregnant wife is just terrible you know life is awful and life was pretty awful at that time but I'd learned from my mom that in the midst of really tough time and it literally facing death sometimes humor can actually help us to get through this really tough times and it was also you you said some friends played you some Sacha Baron Cohen videos and Owen is I think he is the funniest person in the world he is my Thai II to Dave Chappelle Sacha Baron Cohen to my my finiti for him actually goes also back to when my mom is there like it laughs when I was with her I actually when I was back to college I always felt guilty being too happy while she was going through what she was going through I felt guilty laughing and I was with my best friend Ben and Sacha Baron Cohen's TV show came on and board the board character came on in this. Riley didn't want to laugh and I just burst into tears and laughter cuz I thought he was like the funniest person this new foe Kazakhstan evening television reporter and from that moment Borat has become like the person that I the character that and then makes me laugh more than anyone else can and say exactly when when I recovered and I was back to medical school my friends put together kind of a celebration that I was back and somehow to friends are friends and they were able to get Sacha Baron Cohen to make a 2-minute video for me is incredible about you so funny he actually called me the wrong name a couple times turn the video call me Jonathan a couple times and he told me he said Jonathan I mean Dave I can understand what you're going through because last week I went through five boxes of tissues with a really really bad cold this is so awesome he's a real hero by my dad's been having some health problems and like literally just last night he argued landed in the hospital and and I with my brother and I found out and we we had a we kind of did a video call me and my brother and my mom and we could see my dad and in the in the bed and he could understand us and we were joking you know I don't know maybe a Jewish cultural thing in part but heading a lot of people do it out and yeah I mean he was a mixture of concern and love but also our love language in the family is universal abuse so it wasn't directed at him the directed Muslim me frankly but none the less yeah one of my brother say we're talking to my dad about how his 50th his in my mom's 50th anniversary is coming up and he was able to kind of articulate that there will be a lot of kids there for the thing and in my brother said yeah a lot of small Harris's including Dan I do think it's as if he can feel wrong in a way but it also is a me you would know better than anybody has the patient in that situation I got the sense in my dad was buoyed by the Light absolutely I think that I didn't fully appreciate it when I was the loved one I I knew my mom made that joke to make us happy and there were many times where she did that and I knew it was really more for me, but when I was in that position. I realize just how powerful how helpful it is cuz when you're the patient you feel guilty that everyone is going to stop their life to be around you and there their they're there with you and it's typically it's sad and Graham so anytime you can get them laugh and get them smiling it it is so special my wife had the best line of our entire marriage she was about to have a double mastectomy and she's fine now and she kind of looked at me and then looked down into her hospital gown and then look back at me and said say goodbye to your little friend Scarface incredibly important it wisdom of David or Jonathan is the that moment with eating a hamburger so you're pretty you're pretty hard on yourself about your diet and so you allowed yourself to Hamburger which seems simple but it's actually quite revelatory to talk about that before I became a tell I was a vision one football player played quarterback in Georgetown and I was also a personal trainer and exercise and health vows was everything to me that that's what while I was in college and I even I did a public health degree at Oxford focus on cancer prevention with a particular focus on diet and exercise and in relation to cancer prevention and before medical school and so I like I talk on the book I hadn't had ground meat a hamburger in a decade I hadn't had chicken without peeling the skin off of the chicken in a decade and I live this life it's kind of like if I hyper focus on things and I kind of don't ever snap out of it and so you know I ate healthy always and I never broke out of a never had a cheat day never cheated and Soffer for about a decade from the time I was fifteen to twenty-five I just crazy focus on exercise and health and for me it was I want to play college football and then when I was playing college football I wanted to be as best as I could you think it was entirely healthy probably not that you would you put in the category of eating disorder or disordered thinking around a day or body dysmorphia it's kind of how I'm kind of in your book you talk about a friend of yours who is hyper-focus I actually I was diagnosed with ADD to hyper-focus variant from the time I was a child and so so when I focus on something whether it's during Castleman disease or creating a network in memory of my mom were playing college football I kind of do everything to get towards that goal and so this is kind of one of those steps and so and of course then I spent six that's almost dying in the hospital with a disease that is kind of like a cancer kind of like an autoimmune disease and I got out of the hospital and I talked about the concept of think it do it and how how you know maybe it's okay to as you said maybe it actually healthy to make me break out into not live such a kind of a structured focused life and it is actually better and so yeah it's a member one of the thoughts that I have an airport coming back from this last hospitalization was in a hamburger sounds pretty good and it was really really good and as you said it was crazy. What concept of eating a hamburger but but for me it was just this idea that you know life is short and you eating so perfectly healthy and exercising all the time didn't prevent in me Siri says he's not saying that if it isn't so important for health and well-being but then maybe we don't have control over everything and that we should embrace the uncertainty of the where are you now with the you know hamburgers hamburgers healthy looking dude so you allow yourself now I sometimes I do sometimes I don't think it's the middle way between Indulgence and being a monk is so you know once in awhile you don't feel your chicken for me and it was almost dying to gave me that sort of Revelation and I've been able to live that way since then it's that maybe life isn't always black or white maybe where we really should be isn't in that gray area we should really embrace it in Enfield comfortable in that gray area in the final thing I want to explore in terms of what I can see is the sort of scalable nuggets that you gleaned through this store deal is and I don't know any other way to say this is going to sound a little you know he'll Marquis but love is a big deal to stake the blazingly obvious but what did you learn about love I have for supper you're exactly right I learned that love and support and in the people that are your friends and your family they can provide something that and a strength that you just can't have on your own there's a reading of your time at earlier kind of the word verse outward and and I think that those people around you that you love whether it's my sister's my dad Caitlin now my my daughter a million they provide such an important source of strength when you're going through difficult times both helping you get through the difficult times but also motivating you inspiring you to make sure that you do everything you can so you can you can be with them for a long time I think that you're my experience with with nearly dying on each time it really help to focus in that like I said I spend my time I'm working for a cure and with the people I love and I think that that experience helps you to focus in on those are the things that you know your purpose and your people are the most important things in the world if you were in Kaitlyn's position would you have would you have thrown your lot in with somebody who might be dying what it what is to be learned from the leap she made it so I would like to think that that I would I I think all of us would hope that you know we would kind of transcendence think Beyond you know the is it cold in the fear of disease but I think that she's really a hero for the fact that she was able to to look Beyond you know the fact that it looks like my dad's pregnant wife of the time I was bald and you look beyond that and I'm but also made me feel like it like it really was genuine and I think that and that was just the start of it and then I went on and I nearly died two more times during the last one I had such low platelets I was at constant risk of a fatal brain bleed and then I would die really tiny moment I'm in in order to prevent that I need you to get platelet transfusions and they needed to be shipped in from another state to be matched to my for my particular type and so everyday what's we get sent in and every day they needed to the blunt my fevers they needed to put ice packs all over my body to get my fever is down so I could get the playlist because you can't get platelets if you're having a fever you reject them and so I remember at the system memory the fifth time I almost died watching Caitlin would the nurse and they're putting packs of ice all over my body and I'm mostly in and out of Consciousness and not really knowing what's going on with your she is like physically getting me in a place to be able to ignore get these life-saving platelets in in fortunately I didn't have that brain bleed I didn't die I survived but it's little memories like that that that sometimes come up when I see her with my daughter Amelia and I'm just like sitting next to her on the couch watching TV and and those are our memories and there's a special moments that not all of us get to have with the ones that we love and I certainly not at that are young age and I think having gone through that with her makes makes life so much more special in there she's right over there I'll come in here Caleb going to go ahead yes she doesn't want to but she's doing it anyway sorry I didn't get you too emotional on there that I you mind if I ask you a few questions okay so I did you're sitting next to this guy you guys had broken up and he's you know really sick and I forget to how we look that I don't think of the issue but you don't know if he's even going to be around and I'm just projecting myself in your shoes I could imagine having a cocktail of thoughts like if you want to get back together because he's really vulnerable and weak and lonely if I get back together with him is he going to die if I don't and I going to live with regret that I heard this dying person and also if I don't am I going to regret because maybe he was the love of my life but is that an accurate description of what was going through your head yeah I think there's a lot of things that go through your head where you got to talk about it before feeling that sense of guilt I don't think I felt that sense of guilt to get back together with him I just felt bad that I loved him I wanted to be with him I couldn't imagine my life without him and so I was ready yeah I feel like we're broken up and I received a CaringBridge message saying that he the David had taken a turn for the worse so I went to the hospital to go see him and I knew that no matter what I wanted him in my life I didn't know how I didn't know if we were going to get back together I just wanted him back in my life and I wanted to work on our relationship and if we did get back together then we would take that that next step and and figure things out but I was willing to take that next step Next Step even though you didn't know if he was going to be around to keep taking steps I don't know it's a really hard question I don't no need to think about this I'm not sure and I think the parts because you're an amazing person and wanted to for yourself make sure that you were doing what was right but I think you also know you really cared about me I think I'm going to hear I'm putting words in my mouth but I think that you had it mean but we didn't talk about earlier was that the first time he even came to see me in the hospital and when I say goodbye to family and friends I actually told my sisters that I didn't want her Caitlin to see me like that and so they actually stopped her in the lobby and said David doesn't want you to see him and so I turned her away and end in in hindsight I regret that I wish I hadn't done that but I remembered that some of my final memories of my mom kind of her burned into my head and I'm hoarse remember all the good times with her but I didn't want those final meeting that said to be what was burning the Caitlin said because even though we weren't together she was the love of my life and I did that again with my second episode and she came down in North Carolina to see me when I was hospitalized and again I turned her away I'm in so it was the third time when we got back together and it was it was kind of like you know if she was just proving you're showing that this is something that that really meant a lot to her and let me guess at what the answer is that you tell me if I'm right but it's Huey Lewis to be annoying about it it's like the power of love that. What else are we here for you know and it sounds to me like whether you were conscious every of it or not you were like what what what else am I here to do other than be in love with somebody and and live like that there's a big was a big big move so I respect that I respected what do you think is people listening to this and may not have life circumstances that are as dramatic as yours what do you think you've taken out of this that could be you no usable in operationalize a bullet that's even a word for regular folks who are living more humdrum lives like me I think that you just I thought a lot about the bigger picture and I think what you're saying about love is that it is this this bigger picture and so I just just thought about our life that we could have and how how we could be together how we could start a family and so I thought more about the bigger picture than I did about each individual stop what time UPS of him getting him better and I mean I did think about getting a better but I definitely thought more about the bigger picture of love little thing that it that when you're kind of thinking about your life or any decision a useful phrase to bring to mind is what matters most I think I definitely resonate with that and what matters most is David and my family and are now our daughter and everything else doesn't really matter it's just hard I just I'm just thinking I was saying to David earlier that the last 24 hours I've been worrying about something which in the grand scheme of things things I know isn't that big of a deal I can get it keep popping in my mind even while my dad is sick you know but then I feel something like Shame about that but like that's the way the mind works it's hard to keep what matters most in your mind all the time and that's why I having these kinds of conversations I'll just say for myself it's useful to be reminded just want to be reminded thank you for letting me drag you in here I know we didn't give you any warning you really covered everything I think that is Caitlin said we now have this one year old beautiful daughter Amelia and it's something she was messing to is that so much of my illness in in nearly dying I thought about the future and kind of a statement like what could be you know Caitlin and I could be married we could you know have a family together and that was kind of like a dream that I think kept me motivated and help me to fight through each of these these relapse isn't and now we have you know now we are married and we do have a daughter together and now it's it's kind of keeping the screen going is what really motivates me that to keep working every day and I hope that this exam example of someone who's nearly died several times has gone through so many health challenges I hope that this can be inspiring other people that are also going through hell challenges that it sometimes that vision and in the future that maybe we didn't know that we would ever see what we hoped for can actually become reality and then hopefully I can Inspire other people that did started turn those hopes in those those dreams and prayers into reality me too and I hope that your health continues to be strong and Amelia continues to be strong to thank you guys before we go there can you just tell people where if they want to learn more about you I was in the book again chasing my Keurig David fagenbaum it's spelled f a g g a g e n b a u m but are there websites for the organization for college kids dealing with grief with castleman's that people should know that's right yes of the group for grieving college students is called AMF and heal grief. Org is the website for AMF actively moving forward there's also I'm for the Castleman disease net the work that we're doing to try to cure Castleman disease and also create a blueprint of the password for curing many more rare diseases is called the Castleman disease collaborative Network in our website cdcn. Org course I'm so grateful for any support of our work and our mission and then to learn more about the book there's a website now for the book called chasing my care.com where you can hear read a little bit more about some parts of the book The Navy didn't make it in these photos from the befores and afters excellent thank you both thank you again for a David chasing my car just came out last week if you want to learn more about his story go check that out and we've got links to it in our show notes let's do some voicemails here has never won hey Dan a big fan of the show quick question I am in the middle of a divorce and struggling with impersonal of my own I've been wanting to get a meditation practice started I am afraid of the pictures a matter of Will and thank you for what you're doing and I appreciate you taking a call thanks for making a call thanks for the talking about what is clearly difficult stuff for you I don't want to sugarcoat it in my experience difficult things can come up in meditation and I think it's fair for you to be concerned about that I'll say though that in my experience it's better I have not endured a divorce but plenty of other you know ups and downs. It's better to deal forthrightly and see clearly all of my difficult thoughts and urges and emotions within the container of meditation rather than having it at a stewing in the background of my psyche and driving my actions in a way that is kind of blind and reflexive so I think the upside is clear but I'm not going to lie to you and say that the process won't be difficult because I wanted to make sure I really gave you good advice which we also reached out to Ray Houseman who's the head of the coaches on the temperature in happier app we have this incredible Cadre of of coaches who are experienced meditators who are right there to answer your questions if you're a subscriber if you go to your profile page on the app you can go look up your coach and send her or him questions and I'll answer them as long as you want to ask them and Ray is very experienced meditators having heard your question she said she agrees with me that you're right that have some concern and and it's wise to want to protect yourself as you dip your toes into these pretty go to Waters cheat sheet latched onto this notion that you you asked is this a matter of her response was that is probably best not to approach this practice from a place of will they want kind of want to do it slowly with care self care is the Millennials say so that you can build confidence overtime couple practical piece of advice you pass along that I agree with one is at the beginning at least you might want to try sitting for short periods of time maybe just five minutes a day so that you can grow that confidence and interest slowly the other thing is that you can be a good way to to practice when you're in distress because the attention gets directed in a little bit more of an external Direction rather than in an external way rather than having so focused internally I add if you go to the on the go Section on our singles tab in the app you'll find great guided walking meditation hang in there man on this sounds like a really difficult time I do think meditation can help but I also think you're right to want to approach it carefully let's do voice mail number to ask Insider as well as a 10% happier app with scriber and user my question is during all the guided meditations the teachers never give the option of lying down at the first and some of the sleep meditations why is that is it because people are more prone to falling asleep if they're lying down no always talked about sitting up straight as a mom of three the only time that I can be alone is right before bed and so for the last several years I've meditated right before that and I do so in my bed laying down of the former Yogi that's what I know at the end of class so my question is I can't blind down the okay thanks so much well first of all thank you for being a podcast inside her just for the uninitiated you may have heard me talk about this before but podcast insiders are volunteers who give up their time to give us insights then responds send feedback to our podcast episode so that we can do a better job and it's actually ignore Miss Lee helpful thank you for that I also have so much I don't know what the right word is empathy maybe the right word but I don't know that I can fully empathize with what it's like to be a mom I live with one but there are lots of pressures and stresses that I'm sure I I can't even imagine so if you are actually keeping up a semi-regular meditation practice while being a mom and in your case and mom of three that's awesome so I hope you're not in some sort of cycle of wondering whether you're doing it right because when we just say from the outside outset that you're doing it at all is a big deal the rest of what I'm going to have to say is also encouraging for it you know I made mention this in the picat before but if my memory serves there were four traditional postures postures from way back in the day when the Buddha was talking about meditation one is the traditional sitting posture which is quite familiar to all of us the other is standing and walking which we just talked about a few moments ago and then lying down so there's nothing wrong with lying down to meditate it's been right there in the in the documentation in the scriptures were for the beginning so no no worries that would have one reason why I think we generally teach meditation on the app and and other apps and if you go to a meditation teacher the way the reason why I take often it's taught in a seated posture is that's a good combination of being somewhat relaxed while also being alert and the the fear with lying down yeah it will turn into an unintentional nap but according to Ray the aforementioned Ray has been if you're able to stand your attention without falling asleep and lying down is the way you prefer to practice then go for it you know the other thing that Ray mentioned is that you may want to experiment with other pastures if you get a minute or two throughout the day maybe there's like little cracks in your schedule where you can do a sitting or standing or walking meditation that might be something to experiment with but I think the bottom line is I don't think you need to worry about the fact that your practice at right now and perhaps in perpetuity consists of lying meditations especially if it's not making you fall asleep although having said that we do on the app but as you mentioned do a lot of meditation that guy people into falling asleep and if that's your only practiced that too is great I mean I'm I'm really of the view this just me talkin hear that more practice is better than less practice and 8th being overly dogmatic about when and where and how to do it and be counterproductive so keep going thank you again for being a podcast Insider I really appreciate it want to thank everybody involved in putting the show together Ryan Kesler Samuel John's Grace Livingston Lauren Hartzog Michael Buskey who's who always operates
