actor writer he does it all Donnell Rawlings is here thank you very much for coming and we're very excited I don't know if I'm really excited to be I know why what happened on this is not what happened is like what you didn't do what did I do to upset everybody in the park as well as knows that you don't get paid for any of these and it is usually the producer in the house is comfortable as possible, I guess I feel badly now dude I had to drop 45 minutes to work for free and it wouldn't be a big deal to me if I didn't know some of the top podcasters in the world as minimal they send an Uber pool wow I'm saying like I know that there is a budgie whatever but you know what kind of insulting all right I was kind of selfish and I feel bad on me expressing myself you feel this the time for you just to cut me off because this is your show me white people in their power in the grass and never stops bro I'm mortified let me apologize on behalf of our producer and my husband I would have sent you at waist at least a lift a lift right here is your profession I saw you I mean I know you guys do like crap before she was everything I saw you going over the whole thing and I felt more connected to what you would have done what he would have done for people that said it was like never a moment of I apologize but then I get here they say you have to sit on this side of the couch and I've been seeing it seems like this out of couch is reserved for the black people get you and I'm glad you guys can agree with that I will say that anytime you have an African-American guest it would be a good idea to send some type of Rideshare you told him I said the SUV I have Alby Adonis we have sent car service to pick up white gas before I guess I like are you buy a limo or something but now I'm going to start extending it to Black and and other Asian guess and stuff to the you know this world is about we had an issue right we didn't get on Twitter and talk about it now we discussed it with each other and now you've changed our whole plan I change your whole platform and this is what I'm doing for podcast with Jay-Z dip the NFL which is bring the people with concerns to the table so you can affect some type of change that I kept it to myself black people have been driving yourself to this podcast forever that's not going to happen. Robinson is Ramsey this is the state where you got to keep apologizing so you're black what's going on I will tell you that the Popeye's chicken sandwich is not as good as everybody think that that's fucking really by the way you lie about Rob see if you are so Chick-fil-A right now you are you are so take my dearest I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken I imagine it of course I don't Tick Tock but I don't know I don't know but it's like was once one of the biggest stories in history of fried chicken stories ever hit the biggest stories for me you don't know that Colonel Sanders stole the recipe from a black person that made the yes I've heard this start a stealing fried chicken recipe from black person still only white person has ever stolen from a black person I mean it was a rocket Azar's we created Music and theme song is ours are better when it's just always been my God 60s Ice Cube is getting hard time to get people to promote 3 on 3 basketball draft 505 white baskets for Jupiter watch a white basketball team or down syndrome basketball team you know what I would rather watch it Down syndrome basketball team the reason why the reason why I cuz years ago this is a true story this is I know this is love you and I can understand how do you spell volunteer for like a special needs Camp a lot of kids with Down Syndrome right yes and I love those kids really we're good for my ego because we can go out and play basketball right yeah and then when it comes to picking the teams they all pick me I don't have no skills but if you put me up against a kid with Down Syndrome dump his ass with my nuts in his face every time 7 and for some reason for some reason that they thought I was like equivalent to Michael Jordan so I'm partial to the how do you have crazy game like when you are a single dude you like me you really good Washington DC White by way of Alexandria Virginia okay when you grow up there because we watch the gentleman I mean you don't fall into this category but when like unattractive dudes personality goes a long way so you're saying that you're just yourself and you are funny and my friends Jefferson County Court personality personality is what really would bring it home all right like a person with its dope personality in a small penis now behind us this is not like a skilled anything like that you're going to get the initial I love him and oh my God I just met this guy he's so great in a girl's butt oh yeah yeah yeah they haven't had let's just say LED headlights I don't have that big is the biggest penis is not the motion of the ocean is not the size of the ship is emotional that's right sometimes you don't know there's some people in some place with inadequate depends on you know if you work on your stroke Denali in a joke every once in a while I think of a good sense of humor personality I think the dead what is Twitter most part with at least two in the only thing I would want the girl to say afterwards is that kind of hurt not that it was big but just at the thrust were so hard that I would try it like you know like having a go at God damn it you know that hurt that's all I was really you are a walking me to read app show me a picture that's all I want to do I splice a OJ Simpson 911 call in there and you did say wait a second I don't like eating fried chicken sandwiches out. Here's why I'm going to tell you what the fried chicken is good on its own why do I want to put bread and make it into I don't like sandwiches in the first place I'm not a sandwich either I don't like you I like Bojangles now I'm on the road I'll get some Bojangles but now that sounds very racist I don't like I don't know what was the Eagles popular in actually really racist is the way they treat you like we're talking about a giant now you're like not enough to put a pickle on a Dyno Chick-fil-A they do a pickle and that's everybody has a big hard-on for the Chick-fil-A set up with the same idea of the Chick-fil-A sounds even the packaging of it boil thing and I like what I've heard that separates Chick-fil-A from Popeyes is Popeye's does not have a motherfuking Polynesian sauce and nobody even know what the fuck Asian Sauce Nassau Sound so like like so fly your son's extra pickle and can you give me extra Polynesian sauce to George or just relax some reason to lie right yeah that you respect a Wendy's chicken sandwich at all no not really come back with a chicken sandwich and then have a Kool-Aid of shake like a grape Kool-Aid shake and they will kill the hood yeah yeah yeah you're right away for free did I just did about always give away my clothes always white people to sit back and buy all the demands and man you were on you know one of the most legendary iconic shows and it was crazy cuz I met you when the show was on and I was like a brand new comic I was doing a show somewhere like it might have been like near the UCLA campus one of these just shall I forget someone who throws it together I was a newish comic and I saw you in the hallway. As I can cuz I mean that show people don't know if they weren't like you know around for it when it was on his you know it's not that long ago but when it was on but I can't like it can't miss TV this is hard to like think of an equivalent now cuz everything that was on demand you scream and you record things but when that show is on we would like make it a point like that was before the time of streaming yeah exactly I was win like if you think about it when is the last time you had a show that people are like okay Wednesday 10:30 I got to catch this shut down is ostracized I did encourage you to being stuff people come out just like this watch the whole entire season it tonight one thing with that show it was so dumb cuz you had opportunity to watch it when it came on then people talk about it all week all week and then you would wonder if they would outdo it or show it out do it or even just keep that consistency right and every week it proved to get stronger and strongest wild in the show is like I said on that show with half our programming gets work home runs that was always want to just go with the signature is true of that show and then it's like when people say well that was so long ago but that's just a test of how dobi show us because it's still maintain its relevance and pop culture has relevance in comedy and even though in Venice, Central continue to play it but think about it was just so miss stuff like sound bites if so many things in life Skits the Black Bush sketch arts space wars on it it was so ahead of his time and even today when something happens in pop culture right now you can see the Chappelle show me to make punctuated yeah I'm punctuate laughter the Charlie Murphy laugh I know you're tired and I even when I go places people like it's so weird because the show was so big and so he was just such a part of History you can't follow it so in some people's eyes my career has been all he fell off since Chappelle Show know how many fucking Chappelle shows are there ever since the Chappelle show no bro I'm stay relevant I stay funny but you don't get a show like The Wire but every 20-30 year sure you don't get ashore the Richard Pryor show every 10 or 15 years you don't get a show like The Flip Wilson show these are not normal should I keep the record-breaking and then it was one or shows like for me people say so you know how cuz I was like so what was a big break I think that I was already chipping away at a chipping away and I was my stuff was on different platforms different platform the Chappelle show was one of the first things I've done where everybody watch the show so everybody got to see what I did you know before that the BET audience they got to see what I did I was a wreck on The Ricki Lake Show as an expert on field relationship is like the last two years did they had a real hood girl they had a professional and then it was just trying to get different perspectives on topics and I was the one that just started ship yeah yeah yeah I can see you fucking doing that it was so easy I'm up and I wouldn't tell him he was like okay well trust me what is all I had to do was say this because women need to get in the kitchen and sandwiches and then shut up for some reason had two people to follow me from The Wire you had two people follow me from people that were fans of me on a serious acting they all came to the one place also obviously like you know your comments your your friends right before the others what life well I'm saying like they have to embark on the journey like the ride of doing the Chappelle show it's like you know you're doing it right like Dave calls you a man I'm doing the show you like to call me to Neil calls you and you're like okay cool you think it's going to be it's a job right you like it's fine whatever but I didn't I always thought it was going to be fire in a reason why it yet because the reason why I had I didn't have a lot of opportunities to be on TV so I thought I was going to be fire because I'm going to try to make this shit fight all you did okay to be quite honest neither Dave or Neil had the confidence I had in the show as I had really in the reason why is because before that the his name is conscious pilot Boy Productions the reason I came about is because David like 10 or 11 Pilots that he shot that you just didn't pop and I'm saying like we're not for you don't know if it was just time it was so it was a thing like all right here we go with this again you don't let me put my friends again let me put my right stuff together step together and let's see what I could do but that's but when you been in business for so long it's hard to get excited about every project cuz you don't know which one is going to be the one is like me and I believe in it and one person said this so they were going to it like it was a big butt for me being a, just wanted I wanted to work it had to work course you don't mean and I and I knew I didn't even call the ratings are you like this y'all we're going to go from 1.5 to one point I like ya boom boom I was right again because I had the pulse of the streets yeah I was still living in Brownsville Brooklyn and I was if you want to say the voice of the street when it comes to like how people are taking it now and I used to call Neil and I was like yeah I just got off the phone with the streets right by what is $0.03 in Euros building I could feel it cuz I saw some really seedy neighborhood I saw my resume to the barbershop Everybody's Talkin about husband crazy Walking Up barber shop in like in the middle of that show just blowing up and you like how many motherfukers the blue up off that show like let me tell you something different people understand whenever Chappelle Show is on and you saw a scene where was real niggaas in the background it was real nigggas in the background was my biggest see the right way or just never wear part of it somehow guys my friends that went work and I was like yo Cumbia background on Chappelle Show you'll get $75 you get some free food and you get to be be around it anytime for any time you saw a posse it was dude you know that's a real one a big scene when people always ask me what was my favorite skin a famous sketch was Wayne Brady sketch a reason why I was born we did a joke about Wayne Brady Mooney right with Monica and Wayne Brady was a huge fan spell show and he wasn't bitching and crying anything to eat with just you know like a little bit more disappointed you know more than anything and I'm and I know pop party I was busy reach out and express that yeah, they ran into each other and I understand Wayne Brady's frustration because Wayne Brady is one of the most talented people I've ever met my life for sure but his path is not the same passive someone from the street to whatever. He didn't have to work for it this morning that he didn't have to beat everybody out in the audition to do the talented and sometimes it's documented if you don't speak a certain way they don't respect he is diction he's articulate me or something I like 20 years nerd motherfuker so this sketch to come through and not Wayne's disapproval of a joke but just frustration or disappointment of it yeah but they do reach out and didn't invite him like this. Just call a truce with this and it really gay people opportunity to see what Wayne Brady's range was that's why I like cuz it was dark it wasn't like oh yeah it wasn't like Bojangles little louder say your fans are your fast now I remember that the joke that prompted that was ever get someone so makes Wayne Brady look like Malcolm X that was a joke by forget about the story so in that sketch they had to have women of the night but Street Walkers with a right and I was really cool with casting so what I would do is look at the script before we have them and I would see like if there was something for one of my friends and wasn't no lines it was just like you like home boys on the stoop host work I just saw it right so is like to see women of the night so it was on my friends she was she was a exotic dancer she was like she's kind of a kind of show is really pretty strong her name is Pearl so I said. We got this scene after I want me to spend whatever but it's kind of like family dressed you know you plan a streetwalker whatever so all the other women do they cast it they were professional actresses right like they audition for it right so they took their agent you'll have to be 4 inches or lower if you don't have time to sit like a their fingernail had to be you know they were like they were just like real actions and here comes Pearl okay alright let me go we're going to go guys back the one they took it rolls off put them on the side and it went out there and they walk Street and they say that they could wait to put a rose on now Pearl ass out the whole shoe sites like thought I would let everybody all the Grinch everybody's I don't know where the fuck girls came from but she's got out of working at the same time USA standards of practice is nowhere near right and she got clothes to wear and then she just got close to the car and then she just said I like the new show day she went from background to a u v and that show at the time it matter what the fuck you did if you was going to send you blew up in the that's right so she nailed is one of the hottest strippers in the country really want me she said I wanted to pay also I like your new show today that's right because that show also I forget all the time that pop Bill Burr for sure I don't think it was that show the pop billboard billboard was going to pop that's for sure but your punk Azz you talk about following a destroyer so when we were doing it was a second-year we weren't really making a lot of money but we were popular and I'm saying Mary by Jonah Adam rich bitch I'm Rick James bitch and everything in like we wasn't really make a lot of money at a time Bill Burr was probably in the time a thousand dollar week headliner you don't think that's not saying that insulting you know where he is now but we all go through that but you knew whenever you saw Bill Burr perform you knew this white boy about the blow and that's what he did so we words I said we can through this man we can't not get money and we so popular so I said maybe we should do that to her I'm rich bich to it he's big-time agent nail wraps bill now Berkowitz a young age store into his office till we work for you you Charlie and Bill Charlie Murphy's and never did stand-up yep it's tough as you think Charlie Murphy is ice always fuk with you tough you motherfucking all these stuff Gainesville but you turn to a bitch when you get a microphone for a new face just wanted to know more so finally he went took them to the stem on this is when Laugh Factory went to New York and tried to stand there took him to a black show you want to Stage the first time we got about 10 minutes it was a man Charlie what to draw but I knew your bird was fire sounds like instead of just heading into Charlie as a job we don't know what you mean featuring why don't we have somebody was perfect Bill Burr was on the show and Bill Burr was an animal yes I would be Charlie Murphy with going Hindu 10-15 minutes and I feel bad that 20 to 25 20 to 30 and you know it built their does to a stage Hotel people talk about how you get stronger try being on the road will be over for year following that you have no days off anytime I would if I would have had even close to a video cassette the common cards, so what's good I like the white boy happy to really should I ever wrote I like why don't they like me no it's not that I don't like you Donell they prefer a Chick-fil-A sandwich is on the tides but I did but it's every-night in Portsmouth Bill Charlie puth Bill and then right when you left with him every night I had to come in and fire it up yeah yeah yeah actually Charlie Charlie are just starting to sound like a year I want a contest to host a show to host the Real Men of Comedy Tour so it was him and Joe Rogan know that would be anything now the real men economy we have dicks did nowadays yeah I mean I mean I don't know what a real man is women where can I find Ariana the eyeball to her and we both are two of us we have two children non specific gender children's there's one around at the time and say that to now but our older non-gender children were turn around the same time does it have a right to choose right now okay okay what do you feel you're supposed to ask no I'm going to fuck this shit I change diapers what does this what I mean I understand that we are at all I know we're in the right place right now right I want to see my son we are watching the Nickelodeon channel and a Barbie doll Barbie commercial came on and it was a Barbie's Jeep or something he was like Daddy I like that I was I was nervous nervous nervous but I could say that right so I said yeah what is it that you like about that commercial I like that jeep I might cause pink right yeah I like that cuz I want to buy that jeep for mommy Mary goes and Barbies are for girls no it's not good I had to make sure there wasn't a surveillance of no devices on this what the setup and I was like and he said and I said yes and I'm hoping for a lot of things whatever but my son being gay is going to be like it'll be hard for him to be a Green Beret in the beginning my house oh no I did you say that. LOL so you mean you want your son to grow up the phone pussy to stop it what is the world come to this money that like even though I know I'm not bad but you can't take away the feeling a man has about raising son to be but he thinks that supposed to be right things might happen with a change in my alter is hooked up like that it's not going to stop you from loving your kid course I'm saying but with what you thought in the way you thought that because where you grew up where you grew up but now the way things are changing the thought process is totally different things are way more acceptable and it's rightfully so they're way more took I have an older brother that again but it's my brother my father's I had to say that cuz 11th St mom saying that but like I never for years I never knew he was gay I just thought he liked it I know that it just started all that was his trick to get the girls over so when he finally my brother finally came and we were adult we finally came up and told me that I was I didn't really understand it at first cuz he's like you see that guy over there he said that's your brother-in-law but my father is so many kids from so different many women I thought he was introducing me to another half-brother and I was like I said my brother just told me he was gay but he was a heroin Kingpin a DC big time Big Time Dope Dealer he reached the level of things been which is respected you know what he was a real the best free Kodi on everything so I can, get outside your dad I said I think I'm I said pick you up I just found out my brother was gay and my father said yeah man he said I knew what he was up to like he said I knew what he was up to but this is why I know things that change on top of the street do this he's I know these weeds up he said I'm not really with that shit but then he described my brother's boyfriend in this is really big and blocked me in the face that's my niggaa that when we use it in that context death and my father never heard them say this about too many people do you say yes I know he's up to it but he said you know I'm not going to say the name whatever but he said he's a good naked he's a good dude and I'll talk to boyfriend that was big do you evolve then I thought and not the fact what my brother connected to sexually-oriented bottom line is is he a good person is he a good person good person to my son and that's why I know things have changed and as much as the lbgt community thing they complain about a lot of things and everything but the where they're going keep going and Rapid speed rapid speed they've effective change in a faster way than almost anybody in the Civil Rights Movement have done you think the movement after you note a black person does something popped up the black community is like oh my God he just said his back four hundred years the gay community somebody some fucked-up on my God he just said his back 48 Hours reaction represented before we get a new done that I knew something to be upset about it doesn't matter game whatever is like you have good people and you have bad people on any Spectrum you don't say it is go to bed and get dressed people about you just

have musicians we have actors that sitting here and we talked and we goof around but I think of people like you as I think you're like a drug like a human drug because I love what drug would I bet you next so much I loved I feel like positive people are contagious and I feel like enthusiasm people are contagious, I don't think I'll be the one of those by the way I think you're definitely positive energy the energy you put is positive in that it's like do something you know Ryan tseko that my pilot right he's like me and you're positive person and I'm not positive I get things done that's what I do like I don't care what it takes if I got to get grumpy to get there if I got a I'm really you know like I'm not very positive I don't really believe in positive outcomes like I think that that the world is tough yeah and hard and that things don't go well you know when we were talking about comedy before the before the before we started your house like man I bombed out I know how hard it is when I'm walking through your hallway unbelievable what you guys have done the tens of years how many years you been doing this been doing podcast 10 years doing stand-up 1718 has any idea what it takes to make it so that's really my message like you can and it's worth it successes like way better than failing all right both yeah and successes easier than failing right and I like that you say that because it's hard and it's easier than failing because failing takes tremendous creativity that's why so many comedians so many brilliant comedians had so much failure before because cuz they can relate to an audience right in the end in and it really It's just tough man but but failing stuff yeah how do I pay my bills how do I skip how do I look at people in the face when I'm late on my rent I was late on my rent for two months out of three months for two years really 275 a month oh my gosh I love also everybody knows everybody loves hearing you know especially when you see somebody who is really successful and eat people imagined it like all your shit you know your life easy now you're millionaire you got it bad but it's like you came from some bullshit background like you were you were hooked on it with you on drugs really I started out at the bottom I don't have the excuses that some of these inner-city Kitsap my dad died when I was ten and so when when when you don't have when you're got a tremendous amount of energy at 10 years old and that the The Guiding Light kind of goes away the dad you know I just went back and I just want to fuck it grew up middle-class and went into poverty do I had less money when I was twenty-five then when I was 10 years old I had more money my net worth at 10 was a hundred times higher than was it 25 so and then I end up with a drug problem from 16 to 25 I was using drugs everyday who's your drug of choice whatever drug you that really what you got everything Which Wich what you want what you got the most up to be kind of addictive personality and I definitely I definitely have this addictive I think it's a gift absolutely we can Channel it into something what you're doing productive I wouldn't say positive so let's say productive if you can because the positive thing like what is it Anyway right and you're fucking dog dies and guess what you got to go entertain how many people that night you know what I mean you have to do it no matter what place in this motivational educational space you know they're going to be like okay I do a nice Punch Yeah good like I'm doing a business deal I don't have time nice watch like these gimmicks are so much bullshit yeah okay what I'm getting ready to work a deal I'm on the phone walking in here trying to do a deal right now I don't have time my dog died my wife remember what I have an issue this morning, okay I need to change my condition my state so I'm going to walk with 10 ft to call that means I got to go like create a fire walk like that stupid like how can I do that in the real world that that's the thing about this motivational stuff that I think people know is a little bit so should we got some people got hurt on that fire walk last heard if I can apply to my real life and I don't mind paying the price for suffering but I need things that I can use on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday like the psychedelics I know people are looking for psychedelics to somehow open them up to some genius that's great man but what I need I need write in a deal I'm trying to solve problems of like I need money okay I need a solution I can't say excuse me world hold on I'm going to go have a mushroom experience yeah see if I can be open to some intelligence you wait for me till I'm done with my Xperia yeah that should motivate people to get up and get off their asses and stop being losers rank being a loser with your addicted to stuff you're not paying your rent how do you motivate people than what motivates you everyday what would you tell people I don't want to I don't want to suffer everyday I don't myself for a little bit I want to suffer everyday I want to go where I want do what I want and and you know I've been broke I've been broke and worse than being broke is just getting by it like having a nice yeah have to like I'm doing good but I'm not really doing good you know that constant like I can't get a head how long were you in that place for that place 4 from 25 to 45 years old really had money but I still couldn't get a hat and what does that mean cuz I have a lot of people that's confusing but I'm scared I'm still flying coach I have one one person working for me I have 400 people work for me now so I wouldn't spend the money like I was terrified constantly so I say never get advice from a millionaire because when a guy goes from broke to millionaire money he's scared scared I didn't have anything now I got a little bit now I'm a bitch I got to get this little miss little miss pants is don't be a little bit try never take advice from a millionaire when I didn't have any money I was more courageous than when you when I had a minute what didn't get me the million I started protected how do you switch that how do you get out of that I have to get another million and then like I do like what do I do with my money all I'm going to start a retirement account and avoid the taxes on it that was Triple little bit okay stupid fucking stupid I should have been putting all that money and deals but I was I should be unloading constantly but but I was brought up you know this goes back to hey what makes you what motivates you are what you know why right I have been trying to decode if I like my dad my dad worked his ass off and when he died he did good my mom had to sell everything and so I might look at that didn't work but he was considered successful the middle-class successful briefcase good job professional people respected in saved his money had life insurance house was paid for everything by the book and she was unload stuff the next week cuz she was terrified and so from the age of 10 to like 16 17 years old but we were just scared to clipping coupons find everything on sale single mother everywhere she goes she knows they're going to rip her off the plumber the roofer the car dealer everybody's go rip her off right so she thought and that's that conservative mentality of poverty Consciousness if it's in any amount of energy it takes into clipping coupon you see these TV shows the extreme couponers these people spend 8 hours a day clipping coupon putting them in buying or you think you could be using that energy to thinking of ways to generate more mundane versus like all we got to the scarcity safer rainy day you know a penny saved is a penny earned pick a penny up today you ain't shitt with a penny yeah I know now I was raised in that poverty Consciousness to talk to my parents are from like a communist country and my mother we sat on the same couch for my mother saved the couch week I grew up on so that I could have when I grew up I like by the time I got you made a pretty molded the rain had destroyed accusing the garage like a successful parental Tom cuz his Consciousness his parents taught him how to think like a successful like I could produce more you don't have to hoard what you have and I really learned just by when reading like Napoleon Hill and you know guys like you watching you and and Dan Pena who I think is one of the most successful you fucking kidding wasting your time left for the correct you show me your friends and I'll show you your future yeah that's one of your top top that is freaking show me your friends and I'll show you your future you want to know why you're all fucked up airbag I feel as if this is this guy is it as dumb you can't go around saying you got 50 billion dollars like you don't think he died do you have you ever met him what do you think got that you don't go around telling the world I mean if you got 50 billion you know every other people say about you right you know so so that's the first block of the problem I had the first problem I have is that could fuck you ain't got 50 billion dollars. Yeah a Rolls-Royce that make you work 50 billion is a fucking mess and then we're talkin Bill Gates unbelievable nation of well yeah you know so so I just have probably Liars like like. Don't you know I don't lie I don't lie about mine I got I got 6,000 Apartments worth 1.2 billion dollars I can borrow boat out for a billion dollars today you know but that's not 50 billion billion billion is 1 billion fifty times we've got to do something 5,000 more times just to be like that like it it's a stream so I don't mind a little exaggeration but 50 billion defense I think the 50 billion dollar man that that title is because he is I think helped other people aren't that much money I think that's it I'm not sure that he could I don't want to be bored because they're playing by a real book that doesn't think I'm working yes or no more to that I want to get into the part where you said a moment ago you think you have your million you're scared your 2 million do you have an epiphany that takes you out of that or is it slow kind of role 2010 was my Epiphany really that recently oh yeah okay tell me I have been doing like grinding out I have I done got three companies I had my main company my speaking business that's why I know so much about the speaking World being short bulshit yeah and the second business was partnership a Consulting business that I just got royalty on that was a good deal for me and the third was a real estate I was just starting to accumulate a little bit of Real Estate apartments and stuff 600 units and sounds like a lot right but but 2010 k okay the first the speaking business and nobody paying for me to speak 2010 at the country was laying off the second business Consulting business nobody wants a consultant in 2010 so that business got cut the real estate I didn't lose any real estate but the bank's money to went down so I'm watching Lehman collapse on TV is everybody remembers the guy walk out of it the thing with the boxes where in Hollywood living up there on Doheny on the other side of the hill where you're living here for 20 years had no idea my wife's I'm watching the TV I mean Lionel Richie's old house I'm overlooking everything sun sunset Play I Got It Made by Leonardo DiCaprio's my next door neighbor Dr.Dre lives in front of the M&M driving down there every day right like I'm in the I'm in the best neighborhood in Los Angeles and this 2010 thing happens and I'm like my wife is like what what what what what I went with light she's like she's like what what's wrong I said we're about to die we're going to die she said what does all this mean we're going to fucking die it's over it's the end is coming okay it's us and everybody okay I can lose we can lose everything the bank that I would 50 million to collapsed went down it lost a new bank comes in a new bank comes in and says we need the 50 million you have six weeks to pay it mother to business has been cut in half I had the Epiphany this is the problem with the middle class when there's contractions the people that pay the price or not the people in poverty they already been paid the price they pay the price every day hundreds of millions of people doing these big contractions or the ones where the money basically gets taken away you get everybody gets ripped off at the same time and so you follow what I'm saying so well what happens is anybody with wealth but you know whatever wealth is right the millionaire stud the guys were two or three hundred grand put away the people that played by the rules and did all the right things the middle the middle is where all this money gets read distributed exactly to the wealthiest of the wealthy people know about companies okay where it where the where the okay guys we go everybody yeah everybody's been about you know enjoying this the circus long enough now take everything yeah and so so I'm like I'm playing the wrong game I'm playing the middle-class cat middle-class never wins they're just ignored in this country what you guys are doing so good you're doing so good and so much bullshit it's a bunch of white people and black people that made it and start acting like they're white and that buying houses sending their kids off the fucking Harvard all this bullshit find shit porn money for colleges buying houses taking 30 year loans out for four houses they don't need what is your putting money in retirement accounts for Wall Street the only people that win it all this shit at the bank's the banks so what's your what's your philosophy than what I did when I moved all my business so we got to redo everything here okay I've been comfortable in la la it's like the the this is a Haven for just Comfort we're at we're so good here got nobody works here they just complain it is crazy when you see so many cars on the freeway at noon you like what you fucking does anyone have a job what are you doing I'm writing script in my mind I'm so glad to be out of this town fucking town where do you live now I love Miami I thought you want to reconsider gold chains yeah yeah she said that money is middle class I saw that sold the house I got to get the fuck out of here right well yeah you go to Miami was thinking too small. They can take it all away from you right it could all be taken away from you like like the middle class in America is not doing good if you look at the middle class but nobody hears about them in the news what's middle-class what's middle-class income anybody that makes 40000 to probably 250,000 a year massive if you work at Facebook and Silicon Valley you make 250 you can't pay your bills turn up there you can New York City hundred $10,000 in poverty is the poverty line that's in New York City but nobody right it's only like four to six billion people on minimum wage in America it's the median wage the guy make a 58000 it lives in LA or $70,000 until you can't you can't live in this town for 70 Grant your rent 1900 car payments 300 plus the insurance impossible and nobody's having that conversation yeah because people I hate by the way that that one of the Staples of I've just decency of people having conversations is like don't talk about money or politics or religion is like people don't talk about money if someone's really successful like yourself and we can take ya ya ya ya people people are like someone's really successful they like that school like don't you know. Don't bring it up and don't talk to him about it like you don't want to talk to the person that's actually done really well and bring a lot of times a successful person says doesn't want to talk about that like we were talking about right and when I was a kid I was looking for somebody to like be an example like who could be an example cuz you know the drug dealer was going to be an example right you know the kid down the street the one to destroy property he wants to be an example of what I just was looking for somebody to somebody yeah I've been gone for anyting yeah and and I just wish somebody Instagram and Facebook obviously one around them is now Mayweather could be my example yeah you know yeah just bad some money and hoes and so now you got so many examples now that you don't know what to believe in and that's an issue as well right cuz a lot of this Instagram Success is Not really success there's a lot of fake Rolex people that put them on blast break down and then that exists not just for watches but basically there's people who helped personas bulshit you know like they're just they're putting up photos of things that is not real that you can go take photos in front of jets yeah it's crazy here you are a jet owner last I think it was a year ago you sold your previous chat you bought was a G550 or if I should go change my other 17 and man I love him and give it to me not that much but she's also been kind of a hater on my desire to get a job at 1000 feet that is like she's right about that crazy glass longer you have said I've seen interview I've seen clips of you talking about how you been the jet affected your business life you feel like like what was I thinking is all time greatest because they are they keep encouraging me to get the jet what you should get one yeah you guys should get matching Jets fantastic all right so I'm 45 I guess I was 45 years old maybe even 48 and I had flunked 3 million miles yeah Delta United I Ain't Got You or 3 million Miler not a minute does a million Miler get you the diamond status but that's nothing to brag about by the way I was so miserable every time I went to the airport I hate about the worst of the security and then you have to take iron and then it's an illusion it's all an illusion of safety it's not even real Hot Nuts Hot Nuts okay I was waiting for hours on both sides just to get out of my head am I doing I was already financially successful but I was still playing like I want so here's a guy with money and with success and I can't I hate myself I hate on travel haytown moving around because I was still I was still trapped by this middle-class save your money thing safe for what what am I saving it drop dead tomorrow and while I'm saving I making myself miserable everyday so I'm unhappy I'm not even using money for what it should be used for it's no good if it's not used like this but this is how I was brought up right so my wife said to me who is probably 50% of the genius of my life she says Grant why don't you just buy check I like that's fucking stupid Elena like do you know what it caught with do you know what it takes to buy a Jetta I can't believe you say that like come on God damn it she's an actress so I'm kind of like the fuck you read the script right now this stupid man it fucking takes money right I had never research What It Takes I love the way your talking by the way just feels good to talk like this to her to sleep this is how real people talk so hostile about it because I'm like I got to get the money to buy them and then next thing you know you know the woman always works her way in to the to the brain right now and I might Puppeteer X and we bought a Gulfstream 200 which is a really ugly jet but but I was so happy when I bought that yet I'm sure you were at 6 months wow everything got bigger everything got bigger everything got faster I could go but I did five cities in one day and one day I visited 5 customers in 5 cities in 3 states I like fuck this is going to be sick yeah we went through that jet in 2 years or year-and-a-half and then I bought that Gulfstream 550 for a tax write-off so it was like a message in the 2017 it was December 13th a my accountant said we got a big problem this year I mean the business just went furtick along with the purchase of the first went crazy we move to Miami I started thinking different I shedded this middle-class idea this Millionaire Next Door Works book that book they should take that book of every bookshelf and burn them it is fuck attract more people than any book you know Xavier called don't go to Starbucks will be rich one day truck never buy a new okay Gary vaynerchuk buying a car is nobody should buy a car nobody should take a loan on a car do you live in LA

there's always something we live in America who this is America okay and he's a great there's nothing I hung up on it that's it guys let's give the money when I could give the money away that you have to pay right yeah I get the money went okay okay we could we could we could buy advertising on the internet let's just dump your shit on the internet right now maybe about Jetman I call you back I said Hey what if I bought it yet what I'd be ridiculous you never take advice from an account now you're stupid yo hundred bucks an hour play I don't understand your logic. So you buy a jet to pay what we know because it's better if I buy this jet you can make more money if I buy this if I buy the check can I write off my car tax bill is like actually that would work but he's a stupid thing to post all Americans together is we all hate that everybody like you want to win people over I hate the IRS so I called up Gulfstream and I said hey I want to buy a jet from me we don't have anything for two years so two years that I got a problem this week I got to do this before the interview I got 13 days left to consummate the deal Lisa Grant we don't we don't we don't keep chats to sell the people we we build them you got a 18 at least 18 months as soon as I get jealous 18 months I said okay hung up the phone I have this belief that you can always do something about something yeah there's got to always be swayed so I called Matt's my bookkeeper and I said I went to write a check for this much money and send it to bowstring just wire the money she's like I got I said I got there wire wire wire the money why do you know this amount I don't know if they send it it was a big dude like millions of dollars like like more than Millions will grant how do you know they're going to deliver just wire fuck it I called the guy back I said hey bro I just I just sent you guys a little gift at will call stream not the Jedi bought that.

That's the story of the gym really I need a bigger jet already I love the way you think this is a very human you were talking about this on the way extra talking about you in the car and and Morgan talk about with you and humans always want to evolve and do the bigger better thing and I think the perception of wealthy people sometimes in this country and the way I was raised is that wealthy people are bad people who want bigger better things are even though they're just right that's right because if you grew up in the judeo Christian World Tuesday love money right now. But but that the Christians I try it but they say the meek shall inherit the earth and you should be giving rich people are bad that's what you're taught and it's a bullshit it's bullshit but why would she want to fucking be poor the whole yes all these guys like to talk about it you know God has blessed me up God bless everybody broke his problem is too many people are broke down like I know so many church-going people that are broke like I'm like hey bro you got the humility thing figured out like fucking perfectly how about go to work on Sunday yeah but you took two days off this week like you and Miss read your Bible God only took off one day he created everything and took one day off you don't do shit and take 2 days a week off I think you're entitled to more than that you work 40 hours and bitching about it he works 6 days without sleeping credit the butterflies moon Jupiter fucking Rivers streams lakes ponds fucking Dew drops and shit is right up everything everything said fuck it imma take off Sunday right right but what what what do people do like so they misunderstand what what people say about that man they said that saying about the rich the Camel Richmond has play noise likely to check in at the cabin and a sign of something through the eye of a needle right right right right and say it's impossible is less likely man I know some poor people that ain't going to happen for sure there are shity poor people to be poor people and they are big one up and there should be rich people and spread stuff for other people and you're you're producing stuff and I hate this idea that rich people are inherently bad and that's that's what I was fed growing up and that the meek and the humble are the Righteous ones right of bullshit.

save money at all and I don't know I loved and not me so I can we focus on our guest so anyways what should you do with your money in the bank today what do you do with the money then you use money first thing people should invest in his themselves best thing is people here that nigga what does that mean that what do I do with the money go to go to workshops go to seminars go to whatever you're good at whatever you're doing you an astronaut invest in yourself you're an athlete invest yourself don't spend money on belts yeah and looking good like invest in your craft you're a comedian invest in your crap and that means investing in your skills coach whatever it whatever podcast you whatever needs to get you now and right and then also in in your branding in your marketing like people have to know you no matter how good you are if I don't know you're dead matter right so you got to get out there to find out about Instagram I invested a lot of money making sure the people see that Instagram account right or energy money and energy right so invest in yourself first to become great whatever you're doing number to start investing in your business if that if you had done that already in the third thing is started vesting and things it'll pay you every month so you bought you buy a flow of income which is why why you're so big on rental power plants are you completely again I don't know why are you against the stock market in general the same program me every month why why would I want to invest but what about like you know stocks that pay dividends and then they pay every quarter so I just not enough I want to I want to invest in companies like it's the most a company's today 50 years ago the stock market was a great place to be in my mind today it's like these companies their life their shelf life is so short now with technology coming on like seven or eight years has company coming in they're disappearing I mean some of the great companies in the world disappear in today so you going to have more and more that I've always been real I feel like people are a lot of speculation going on there like yeah I just don't spect I don't want to lose what I've read Warren Buffett he says look don't lose money number to rule don't lose money yeah I don't know what I'm doing when it comes to these companies I don't know what's going on behind the scenes I don't know what technology is coming on but this is more than I was about to say is that like for me another Warren Buffett thing is you only invest in businesses that you understand so you never you never buys into any if he's like if you explained the business he's like I don't know what the fuck is going on he doesn't do it so for me I came up in a household where like it's all about Wall Street right so that to me is normal yeah I've always known of people doing real estate obviously it's like it's it's you know it's out there one knows it yet people do that that's always been to me like a scary kind of thing around like I don't know where to go I don't know what to get to buy investment property advise it's so simple though it's so simple like like I hear what you're saying that but you know we buy all we buy those things to produce income so I don't buy anything but rental property where people live in them like I buy no retail no shopping centers I don't buy Bank bank buildings where Wells Fargo is not paying her rent because I don't think Wells Fargo that's going to have a bunch of bags in a future there's no way that that's like a blockbuster how do you target a again I'm driving through this neighborhood I can buy those I wouldn't buy anything in California because you don't actually own the property or any more you know that because the state Kentucky property taxes too much your income tax too much and most importantly the tenant you can never get the tenant out here right they are can a victim I would never own anything here I wouldn't New York New York just passed the bill you can't raise the rent they're so got two months ago bought a piece of property in New York City this going to happen here too it's already starting to happen he bought he bought this property New York City says I'm a come back in and spend 25 million dollars to fix this and raise the rents Note 2 months later he already bought it here at closed on it to do you stop that that piece of property will go back to the bank right he will lose the privatebank samurai call me and said hey get ready yeah so we only buy properties we don't build this very specific we only buy properties are 90% occupied or better that we get a check the next month and we only buy in warm States interesting where there's a tax benefit and positive job growth only warm States yet so you don't want by and Boise why is that they're going to leave Boise sooner or later 80 million baby boomers that are going to get old and you got Millennials that are just going to go with a job so and that's not what the jobs are so you got you got a hundred fifty million people for the first time in the United States that will be renters as a choice not because they want it not because they have to but because they want to be mobile right old people older people the Baby Boomers to not they've already on the home you've already broken that with your life that's not everything it was made out to be right do you think it's so clever you say is it kind of it's bullshit to buy a terrible investment because you're stuck in one place you know and and and Analysis actually have only done like 1% for the last thirty-five years I rent where I live by these rental properties in those venerate your and what I do is I have all my money I have no money I would never have equity in something that done for this cash your house doesn't pay you that makes it a bad investment this will blow people's minds though I think like it probably is in the moment that you are a wealthy guy and you rent where you live at that hearing that yet cuz it can get me places right nobody goes to your house to do a deal with the house is that you're hoping when you read when you sell it that's when you'll recoup or you'll make your profit but that isn't always throw the case but Monday will be better in your business your business right and that the who who's really making the money on that the bank the bank is what they make the whole transaction right so they made 6% when the seller pay for that that that was passed on to you 6% when you sell it at 12% to 2.3% every year to the state if you own the house between your test 40% 44 % OK the bank May 5 or 6% every year so 20 years * 5% that's 100% so you have to make like a hundred and sixty percent to break even for 20 years so you're getting fucked when you buy a house basically and the worst thing is you are stuck there the whole time when you didn't want to be right you wanted to move somewhere else I like half a million I'll have to sell it right now fall off this economy and you're not going to sell that house that's another problem the resale good luck from 2010 Jesus underwater was about that shit but it feels crazy to go I'm going to rent a house that is so good to rent really have to pay for the water heater breaks do you deal with that was kind of Ben Platt. I'll tell you in the morning I was just wearing Ocean Beach Inn in Miami Beach and there was a storm that came through and blue all the furniture into the swimming pool I went out of my deck saw that on my I said funny shit I don't have to call around about it I know that's broke and living in a back house in Redondo I was like oh no this is the best some ship breaks down call the fucking landlord not my problem now it's always my problem the kids want to fucking car down the toilet that's a $1,500 problems now it's my exactly yeah I know man I hope I didn't buy into the idea being in 20-30 years now it's yours so now when you're old you own this thing so when you're old and you don't want to be there in a second if the couch on steroids you're right I don't want the fucking caucho party wants Weber Realty One houses a good idea what's 6000 of them like yeah cuz that's what I owe 6000 little houses there are houses there there the apartments right so that the people pay for every month okay there's no there's no limitation on the deduction of the interest like you have it you have an interest cap you can't write off more than $750,000 worth of debt I can write off there is no limitation I could have 7 billion dollars for the interest and write it all off wait let me ask you this my step dad he's dead now but he made a fortune doing what you're doing a rental properties but he would only buy lower-income people ship is that what you do or don't buy into the lower incomes Middletown homes that's what he did he would pay always pay so I'll go by the lower okay but I'm by I'm buying properties you guys would live in you be like should I love this place and they collect rent and do your advice though is sell your house rent a place to invest in rental properties do it yourself I wouldn't do that if I were you guys because you're right here don't touch anything here or find somebody that you can partner with this doing kind of what I'm doing in in those types of states in places where it's going to be good for the next 10 or 15 or 20 years so that be like Texas Texas florida-tennessee Georgia anything warm jobs are moving down there positive migration yep you need people to rent the economy takes a dump again there will there's more renters and then you're definitely not going to be buying houses I need rent and to the people out there that go look at all I want to know Grant tell me how can I get rich man what should I do like is is there a I know it's you know I don't know if that's a simple question a complicated question I love that you're asking that question right but but I think most people are not most people are asked in like yeah but is he happy happy to me yeah guys probably got a fucking problem you know everybody's got a fucking from the poor guy's got a fucking problem no one's got a fuck I know but I'm just telling you that much and have a problem it has money make you happy on my I was never trying to be happy Happy's never been on my bucket list you guys want to be happy good good good for you because I'm not interested being happy I want choices choices happy yeah I want choices give me choices when I don't have choices I'm never happy but is not human suffering is not having options but that's the big thing that people don't understand about wealth is that wealth is actually not about things it's about an option about choices and that's its freedom you can do so many more things because you have the well if you have a castle you have to go back and live in it telling the upkeep on the damn heating a damn Castle be inclined to go back to Aspen I don't want to go to ask but I want to go wherever I want to go yeah and not be makes sense for me to go back there so what was your question how do you get rich number one you had to make a decision did I want to get rich the better decision was I want to get super rich I can't fuck this out that's what when I was 50 years old I want to get to where I can't fuck it up it's where they can't take it from me yeah cuz it cuz cuz I can't take it from you when you have a little but that one car wreck either you're you're hurt or are you hurt somebody one car back and take it all the way yeah yeah one gum lawsuit can take care of everything away you know so I've been audited by the IRS for Times Really they won every one of them I paid one fine of $2,500 for some bullshit that they that we missed right but they were going after more than 24 sure that at 3 cite a headlock gets make a decision to get super rich number to you got to get rid of all this couch thinking yeah everything is trapping you to normal you have to understand you got to somehow figure out how to unbrainwashed yourself save your money look for a good deal Buy Low sell High yes. What the wealthy are doing okay the third thing I tell you do a study the institutions don't study people study the institution I study Blackstone I study the big companies but they're doing Google's

produces every companies ever invested in they all produce cash flow and he takes major positions a little position he tells you what's good to do it right but Warren tells you to do what he does to different things so that's what I do I study what guys are doing or companies are doing you know Coca-Cola I was in I was in Brazil and I saw Coca-Cola on the Shelf in Brazil and I'm like fuck what was I thinking why am I not in Brazil Coca-Cola's on every Shelf they're everywhere yet I got to get everywhere so those are the three things to see you taking the Grant Cardone brand everywhere tell

away all the all the garbage that you know if I can do it everybody can do it yeah I have proof that I was broke when I was 25 I was in that I was had a drug problem I could make my rent at 275 a month and I was selling automobiles + 6 jobs and was fired from the car dealership six times they kept hiring you I just wouldn't leave the check to the jet company just see what they're going to do I had this wonderful boss and mentor and he told me his name is Kevin O'Donnell he said Christina sometimes you have to not be afraid to impose your will on others and I took that negatively back then but it's not an it doesn't have to be negative it just has to be in the mindset of like none of no dish it's going to happen it's just a matter of how was going to happen exactly not how and when not if it's just taking ownership the rules are rules are that's the biggest student sitting the desk when the bell rings get up and go and now go sit in this cubicle you sit here from 9 to 5 and that's a little thank you to everyone I'm so excited that they train you from day one to be a docile body yes training you and then the have the courage to say Fuck this why am I working in this cubicle to make that guy I meant multi-millionaire and how much am I making you should be so you guys are out there like I'm not making it I'm not making other people Rich anymore you have to make other people Rich you can't because it's a symbiotic you need you are tears of Shiva thank you for my bracelet and you aren't that thanks wow don't be a little bitch Champions dominate is true me to call losers I think that that's another thing that you see in like in the hallways articulated but that really successful people are actually really competitive people and if they do you know if you had if you were six eight you know at 2:30 you'd be imposing your will on the court are you I mean but like you're in business if that same competitive Drive business and money my career last a lot longer than a buck

to fail and I'm not everybody's a goddamn winter not everybody should be getting the trophy it's the guy that wins the race of the girl who wins the race against the fucking trophia and the weenie culture today is that we're all special we're all fucking snoke no we're not and you need to work to be special and good you know, but I like that about you I like what you're preaching to people cuz it's old school Rio actually be more than what I've done or you can do less than what I've done but like just cuz you're here don't mean but you're going to do great shit yeah so what were you saying
