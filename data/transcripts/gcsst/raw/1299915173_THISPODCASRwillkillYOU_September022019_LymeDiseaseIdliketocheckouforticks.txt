My name is Brenda Allen I'm an associate professor in the department of Entomology at the University of Illinois and I study the Ecology of ticks and tick-borne diseases and I got into this line of work as a result of my first experience with Lyme disease which was both my first research experience of college to get a research internship at the Cary Institute of ecosystem studies in Upstate New York to study the Ecology of Lyme disease was the summer of 2000 so I had this summer internship and a lot of what it involved was traveling to different Lyme disease hotspots and collecting ticks in those locations and so of course in the course of that work I was pretty diligent about protecting myself against tick bites but the infection rate in ticks in that area is incredibly high and so that point the summer at least one tick got through my defenses and I came down with Lyme disease and so that was my first brush with the illness as well as with studying the biology of the Seas I don't believe I ever found the one that got me so I just came down with the symptoms I mean I was typically You know despite wearing protective clothing I was typically removing at least one take per day and so for the most part I was probably removing those texts before I could be exposed to the wind pathogen but but yeah I just came down with Lyme symptoms and it woke up feeling pain in my joints in a little bit of a fever and I've been spending the summer studying Lyme disease when I was really quite confident in myself diagnosis and so I went straight to a physician and then that part of the US II you report symptoms in the summer time that you need a remote the approximate Lyme disease think they treat you with antibiotics and so I was feeling better within 24 hours and then I got better quite quickly and then I eventually got the bullseye rash but it was about a week later I was already well recovered at that point back out doing fieldwork collecting more ticks so in that lab I was unfortunately the only person to get line that summer there were probably 20 or 25 students and you know that this was a research group working on Lyme disease and so one of the few of the Mantra of the research group everybody was supposed to take these preventive measures really seriously until I felt well it was a disappointing that I was the one person who got Lyme disease that summer and then of course everybody want to see the bullseye rash so you know for that week that that rash was on the back of my knee I couldn't get down the hall without somebody asking you to stop and look at it which is this constant reminder that I failed from getting Lyme disease while collecting ticks and I haven't had any tick-borne disease since I've been I've been bitten by hundreds of thousands of ticks since then but I'm really it made me all that much more Tasha's about during the course of doing field work on ticks I'll check myself multiple times a day. Just trust in my clothing and Rafael wants to get the job done just take checks really are the best strategy for 4 hi I'm Erin Welsh and I'm Erin allmann Updyke and this is this podcast will kill you and it's our final episode of the Season it is and you know what guys it's going to be okay we'll all get through this time yeah we're going to miss as much as you do it's true actually yeah it really is it really is so we have to take a break though because there are a number of really important and cool and exciting things happening Aaron what's going on with you with me what's going on is I well by the time this episode comes out I will have birthed a baby human a baby human baby yeah so I'll be doing that during our break until we come back for season 3 it trying to keep that baby human alive outside of my body what will you be doing errands I will be moving across Atlantic actually within a couple of weeks after the episode airs I will be moving all of the stuff that I brought with me over to Europe back to the US which means we'll be in the same place according for once I'm so thrilled I can't even express my emotions me too and it's not going to be a long wait until season 3 start at the only the until the end of October and don't worry we've got plenty of stuff that we're working on during our break including crossover episodes including we're working on merch we are more more more. I know that you all have requested different t-shirts and stuff like that and guess what we want to bring them to you so we're working on that so make sure if you don't already to follow us on Twitter at T pwky and Instagram and Facebook at this podcast will kill you so that you stay up-to-date with what we're doing in the meantime and make sure you click that subscribe button so that when we come back for season 3 at the end of October you won't miss sink so this week as you may have guessed we are talking about the much requested requested Lyme borreliosis we got more request for this than I think any other disease I think so too and you just heard from our incredible wonderful supportive kind tastic that was weird at all advisor PhD advisor Doctor Brian Allen the one and only hope you give him a round of applause wherever you're listening to this because we've mentioned it before we haven't ever had them on the Pod we're thrilled that he is here to give us not only are first-hand account but also some insight into the current research on the Ecology of Lyme disease later in this episode yes Brian thanks for coming on and also so many people has one of the sources of stress or complaint or frustration is their advisers and that conflict between student advisor and it was that was never the case with Brian and it's just like it's amazing how much that paved the way for a as pleasant as could be. Brian you're the best anyone who wants to work on disease ecology please yeah Ryan Allen he's so the best that he let two of his grad students start a podcast during the last year of their phds that's pretty you feel like that speaks for itself I mean to be fair he called it a Blog for like 4 months still not sure that he'll ever listen to this I don't know if you know you know anyways okay on to more important things the most important things in fact for in teeny time is quarantine e time what are we drinking this weekend we are drinking the dilution effect this is such a good name for this drink you will just have to wait until the History Section it's a really great name I'm pretty I'm pretty stoked about it what is in the ocean affect which was which is also a great name is also great name this is gin lime juice sugar chunks a lime and Club Soda Springs chance of course beautiful plump cherry pop that sucker in there so that it's like a fully engorged tick full of Blair just waiting to be popped be your blood just getting out of it it's a very delicious drink and we will post the recipe for that quarantine along with our non-alcoholic pussy Berita on all of our social media channels as well as our website this podcast will kill you. Com all right that's fun were there were in the mood we're in the moon surface let's get in to the biology of Lyme disease shall we I think we shall go take a quick break so Lyme disease is a bit of a doozy has the longest pages of notes I've ever had so omigod really vaccine maybe not longer than vaccines but that was too episode so it doesn't really count okay okay so Lyme disease people have been requesting this for a very long time and it's probably because this is something that many of our listeners or their friends may have had in the past if you live in the US or in Europe or in Canada or even in part of Isha which I didn't realize that Lyme disease was quite so widespread its Global baby Global disease Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease diagnosed in both the US and Europe and I'm pretty sure in Canada is well and the most common vector-borne disease in the United States yes so it's a big one I also can't kind of believe that this is the first time that we've ever covered a tick-borne disease on this podcast yeah I have noticed that and I think it's surprising and not surprising at the same time and also won't be the last one that we cover definitely not there's a lot of really really interesting tick-borne diseases out there so get excited okay I'm not going to talk about the life cycle or the Ecology of ticks because you're going to do that in my right I'm going to attempt that you're going to do a great job so we'll just jump right in two when humans get infected essentially so Lyme disease is a disease that's caused by bacteria specifically little spirochetes bacteria which means they're adorable little corkscrew-shaped little creatures which also makes them very hard to find because they're very thin and spindly so when you try and stain for them the way that we staying for other bacteria they're really difficult to find on the scenes and I'm saying bacteria plural on purpose because I'm just talkin about a single species this disease is very much more complicated than that most commonly Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium borrelia burgdorferi in the US and in Canada as well as in Europe however in Europe lime can also be caused by two other species of borrelia borrelia asses l e i and borrelia garinii I always here but yeah and also only right yeah there are a couple other ones that are newly discovered as well but it's sort of just let's just call it the borrelia group in Europe in the brilliant Group North America the borrelia group in Asia yes there's many other species as well so on top of that are transmitted by multiple different tick species across their range so we've got multiple tick species multiple bacterial species faceted disease okay it's I mean complicated so how do humans get infected that's the first question we have to answer so when you encounter an infected tick and it bites you it's not like a mosquito it doesn't just feed on you for like 10 seconds and bar fits holes salivary glands into you right away take take their time they burrow their face into you and ask her sometime of being attached they will then start spitting the contents of their salivary glands into you and transmit the disease so that's how you get infected you get bit by a tick it stays on for long enough to spit its contents into you and now these little spirochetes are free underneath your skin did you know though that Lyme disease so like borrelia the tickets to be attached for a lot longer than for something like tick-borne Encephalitis which is just instantaneous yeah it's like deeper is it just like it's deeper in there salivary glands or something it takes them longer to get it up and out or what I don't know I think maybe it's something like that maybe it's something about the feeding process of cell for the where exactly yeah I don't know yet but in general they have to be attached for at least twenty-four to thirty-six hours before you at risk of getting infected with Lyme disease which is Tick checks are important take checks check your body and your friend's bad protects there's there a several country songs about this should we get permission to play one I'd like to check you for ticks okay so now you're infected you have little spirochetes bacteria underneath your skin spiraling their way through your skin tissue may be making their way into your bloodstream and here's where we run into our first set of complications when it comes to Lyme disease we don't have a really great handle on what borrelia does once it's in your body or exactly where it goes which can make it difficult if you're trying to find the actual bacterium in someone's bloodstream for example which is how we usually test for infections right we take your blood and we look for stuff in it or we take some other bodily fluid and we look for bacteria in it borrelia are kind of hard to find and we don't know exactly where they go what we do know is that as they're making their way through your body they stimulate a massive immune response on your part so your body knows that the spirochetes are there and really starts attacking them so what that means is that most of the symptoms that we'll talk about are not caused by the bacterium directly but by your immune system's response to the bacterium right right okay easipart now live in to the harder part Lyme disease we can't get that far into this episode without talking about the fact that there's a lot of controversy I guess you'd call it around Lyme disease there's a lot of misconceptions in a lot of miscommunications and a lot of angry yelling when it comes to Lyme disease and this has led to a lot of mistrust between the medical community and patient advocacy groups and a lot of people not feeling very heard or seen by physicians so full disclaimer we don't have all of the answers when it comes to Lyme disease there are still some great areas there is a lot that we do know so well this is a complex disease what we're going to do for you is try and break down the scientific data that we have as it currently stands I want to do is first talk about the symptoms and how we diagnose and treat Lyme and then I'll try and address some of the specific misconceptions and controversies surrounding Lyme disease that's not good show the first thing to know about lime is it there are actually three different stages of Lyme disease early localized early disseminated and late Lyme disease those are the three main stages as you can imagine early localized lime starts the earliest after exposure and it's characterized by a very very specific type of rash called erythema migrans em baby CM means everything that means redness and migraines like is to my great so this is a red rash it's not itchy it's not usually painful at all it's usually round or at least roundish and often it has an area of what they call Central clearing so there's a part towards the middle that's less red than the edges which are more red and then sometimes right in the center you'll get some serious inflammation or necrosis even where the tissue starts to die right in the middle by yeah this is what we call the bullseye rash it really doesn't look like an actual Bullseye all that often but it is a very distinctive rash the sort of red margin and then it's more clear in the center and it while it can be confused for something like cellulitis or something like that in general this is not painful at all and so and it also slowly grows over time which is why it's called erythema migrans it's like it migrates this rash doesn't have to happen where you got bit from The Tick so it's not like the tick bite is in the center of the rash or anything like that it can happen anywhere on the body most often happens in the armpits the groin or the back of the knee donut really in the groin there are lymph nodes in the back of the knee So at least in the armpits in the groin there are lymph nodes have to do with like a great that's actually probably has a lot to do with it so this early localized form of the disease begins within usually a few days of exposure although it can take up to a month after exposure for this rash to first appear and this rash you could have only this rash and that could be the only symptom that you have of Lyme disease but very often you might have some other very non-specific symptoms things like a mild fever nothing Bonkers high or anything just to low grade fever generalized weakness and muscle aches arthralgias or joint pain are pretty often associated with Lyme disease and then things like headache stiff neck maybe you have some swelling of lymph nodes around what you don't see are things like respiratory symptoms or cough or anything like that okay search important things about e m this rash specifically it is estimated that 80% of patients actually have this rash 60% it's it's a more, my guess is that this is 80% of people who are actually diagnosed with Lyme so it might be lower in people who end up not getting diagnosed or something like that but it is estimated that that e m rash happens in 80% of patients and E M does it happen in basically any other disease except for something called Starry which is Southern tick-associated rash illness the best name for an illness of all time and I'm not going to talk about it it's another Beast entirely that we don't know a lot about but it causes the same rash it's transmitted by a different tickets in different Geographic areas okay which Tech A Night to Remember maybe it's a Lone Star Academy it's in the south okay so what that means is if you have if you come in to a doctor's office with this em rash you got lime done especially and hopefully this is true you have some kind of way that you potentially been exposed to ticks even if you never found a tick on your body right like you've been outside in an area where ticks could potentially exist right okay but what's important is that at this stage testing is awesome negative and we'll talk more later about why that is but at this point if you see that rash that slime and it can be treated as such okay that's early localized disease second stage is early disseminated Lyme disease which is similar in that it's an early manifestation usually again within a week to several months but someone may or may not have ever had the specific symptoms of early localized disease it's basically dress you can think of it as like a little bit more severe down the scale of Lyme disease we're now in addition to potentially having multiple of these em rashes early disseminated disease is characterized by like neurologic symptoms so that means that the bacteria or the inflammation has reached your nervous system especially things like meningitis or very common what you talked about before that's inflammation of the lining of your nervous system that shows up with things like headache and stiff neck you can get nerve palsies which is nerve what's the word paralysis especially like one of the kind of classic symptoms is bilateral facial nerve palsy so bilateral Bell's Palsy both both of your facial nerves get paralyzed essentially but it can't happen to any other nurse it's not only your facial nerves but it is really common to happen in cars that get paralyzed you can also get nerve pain or end up with something even more serious like encephalomyelitis which is inflammation of the brain and spinal cord both so those are sort of more serious manifestations and they're also more rare manifestations of lime okay the other common presentation at this stage of Lyme disease the early disseminated stage is what's called Lyme carditis which card as in cardio like your heart means that there are heart manifestations the most common is called heart block which means that the conduction system of your heart is no longer working properly so that then your heart can't beat properly this is a pretty serious illness that can happen as a part of Lyme disease who can get me my o pericarditis which is inflammation of the muscle tissue itself so not the conduction system but the muscle tissue and the lining of your heart the surrounding of your heart there's a lot of different ways that Lyme disease can affect and all of this is part of early disseminated Lyme disease that's okay super cool while super fast are you going to give me some numbers on what percentage of people this happens to that's it it's a good question I don't have exact numbers okay yeah I mean we'll talk about how many people get diagnosed in general I don't know what the breakdown generally is between how many people are diagnosed early localized versus early disseminated versus late except to say that the vast majority of people are diagnosed at some point in the early stages so whether it's early localizer early disseminated and honestly it's kind of a it's a little wishy-washy the window between those right like it's really just if you have these serious nerve or heart manifestations then we're going to call that disseminated whereas if the symptoms are less severe just like fever and and joint pains they'll probably call that early localized and if you have multiple versus a single of the bullseye rash and so how does this play into the actual microbiology of the bacterium it sounds like what is it doing inside your body where is it going how is it actually causing his neurological symptoms if it's it's really unclear and like I said it's it seems as though many of the manifestations of lyme are caused by inflammation so our bodies response to the spirochetes right we don't really know where the spirochetes is going I mean obviously it's attacking our heart and it's attacking our nerves how exactly it's doing that isn't entirely clear there's a lot that we don't know about lime yeah there really is cereal e-juice yeah there's a lot that we do know but there's a lot to me do you know and we'll keep talking to tell you all those things so generally by the time that somebody presents with some of these more severe symptoms generally means that they have been infected long enough to get their body has started to make antibodies against the bacterium so that means that now we can actually test for Lyme disease in the early localized stage when you just have like just a bull's-eye rash and maybe a fever you haven't started to make enough antibodies to be able to test for whether or not you're infected with Lyme but by this stage you have so now we can check your blood and find evidence of the fact that you've been exposed cuz like I said before since we don't know exactly where the starter kit is going and it doesn't seem to if it does hang out in your blood stream it's makes itself really hard to find we don't have a lot of good tests to look for the bacterium itself so the way that we tell that someone has been infected with the Lyme spirochete with borrelia is that we look for antibodies against borrelia okay so that's the antibody test is the primary like a Sarah pot a positive test to be the only way pretty much yeah there are some others that they're not as good and one thing I wanted address even though I said I was going to dress misconceptions later let's start with one right now there's a lot of I think Miss information about whether or not these serological tests are real and obviously noticed that we have in all of medicine is a hundred percent perfect I don't think there's a single one that's like a hundred percent I don't think there's a single one that's like a hundred percent sensitive and specific maybe there is and someone's going to yell at me for saying that but a test that is has a really high sensitivity will accurately identify everyone with the disease they won't miss a lot of people so you end up with a lot less falsely negative people that make sense a highly specific test means that if you got a positive it's definitely just that disease that you're testing for so you end up with a lot less false positives with a highly specific test but you might miss some positives with a highly specific test that makes sense yes so you want to talk to be highly sensitive over highly specific potentially depending on this scenario and in this scenario yes you probably want to test its highly sensitive cuz that means that we're not going to be missing any cases of lyme yeah we might accidentally diagnose people with Lyme that actually don't have it that are full sleep positive but we won't miss anyone and say oh don't worry you don't have lime when they actually do right with a highly sensitive test early on in like an early localized stage of the disease these tests are logical tests are not very sensitive there maybe like 40% 45% sensitive however as the sages progressed so as time goes on they are between 90 and 99% sensitive and they're also pretty dang specific as well so these are actually very good serological tests so what that means is if someone has been tested especially after a certain. Of time and tests negative it's very very very unlikely that they had Lyme disease makes sense so glad we cleared up misconceptions okay we have one more stage of Lyme disease and that is late Lyme disease so this is something that happens if someone who was exposed to Lyme disease was never treated and it generally happens between a few months to even a few years after exposure again if someone was never treated for Lyme the most common feature of late Lyme disease is arthritis especially in a few large joints so not like all of your joints but not just one but a few large joints but it also can present with encephalopathy which means mental status changes so something like mild memory loss or feeling fuzzy not feeling like yourself and what's scary about this one is it's usually really subtle it's not like it's not like full-on like all of a sudden you can't remember anything it's just little brain shifts which sounds just so Insidious and yucky yeah polyneuropathy some nerve pain and then because we're talking about in some cases different species of borrelia in Europe there's actually a few different manifestations of both the early disseminated and the late disseminated that are more common in Europe and a lot of them are sort of skin manifestations so like weird blue blue colored lesions that slowly in large and that's Zain stay distended yeah it's called acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans that's very interesting and strange okay so those skin manifestations are mostly due to burn belly infection specifically wait Lyme disease is actually the type that was first characterized which is cool I didn't know that but these days it's fairly uncommon because most people have some kind of early symptoms and are able to be diagnosed and treated but if somebody never was like maybe they just had a rash and very mild symptoms and never notice the rash cuz it was in a weird spot then it is possible that they could present for the very first time with symptoms of late Lyme disease pictures of diagnosed in exactly the same way as early disseminated where we look for antibodies in your blood cool okay okay so how do we treat it so question though active infection vs. residual let's talk about ocean processes that the long still on Converse let's first talk about how we can treat it then we can talk about what might happen after we treat it so most people who present with signs and symptoms of early disease weather early localized or disseminated will need between 10 and 21 days of oral antibiotics it's usually doxycycline which is a pretty standard antibiotic there are some others that people use as well and so current recommendations are between 10 and 21 days for early disease know if you have certain neurologic or cardiac or more complicated manifestations that may require IV antibiotics for up to a month or so and the same is true for some people with arthritis arthritic manifestations of line they might require longer courses or IV antibiotics and about 10% of people in the US Who present with severe joint symptoms don't seem to respond very well to that first round of antibiotics and may require a second round there is not a ton of evidence so far for antibiotic resistance for borrelia but obviously antibiotic resistance is a huge issue in general so that's a concern for every bacterial disease most people if they present with either early localized or early disseminated symptoms will recover completely most of the time within 20 days which is still a very long time 20 days to be sick and feeling miserable like that's still a really long time and in some cases it can actually take up to six months so it's not that you're on antibiotics for 6 months but it might take you up to six months or more to be before you're actually feeling all the way better hundred percent yeah yeah which is miserable especially with some of the symptoms like joint pain muscle pain fatigue like this can make it really difficult to function like a human you know in the society that we currently live in ya know several Studies have shown in addition to this that even though most people recover completely between 11 to 15% of people who are treated for Lyme will report persistent symptoms so lasting longer than 6 months symptoms like fatigue myalgia sore muscle pain and difficulties with concentration and memory so it makes sense it's a logical jump to think that hey I got sick with lime and I felt like crap and I got treated with antibiotics but I'm still miserable that must mean I need more treatment right the antibiotics didn't work but this is where Lyme gets a little tricky for some people these persistent symptoms after treatment for Lyme disease have led to a diagnosis of chronic lyme disease this is a really controversial term and it's not one that currently has a definition in the medical community it's not a recognized disease in the medical community this is in part because the notion of a chronic lyme disease implies a chronic or prolonged infection with borrelia burgdorferi the spirochete bacterium that causes Lyme right however there is no good evidence in people with these persistent symptoms of persistent infection with the line bacterium right okay while there have been a few animal models that suggests that small amounts of the spirochete might persist in certain tissues these studies don't translate well to human disease for a couple of reasons one this is as you'll hear later a wildlife disease so it's very reasonable to think when were studying it in rodents that the spirochetes might behave very differently than it does in humans particularly and it's Reservoir hosts exactly which are small rodents that are very commonly used for animal testing additionally a lot of the persistent symptoms most of the persistent symptoms that we see our subjective there things like arthritis and fatigue animals can't tell you if they're feeling those feelings the way that humans can so it's really difficult to even understand how that might translate from an animal model to a human however in studies of humans with persistent symptoms after treatment for Lyme disease there is no good evidence of chronic infection with borrelia so they've tested for trying to find the actual bacterium in various tissues blood skin tissue I asked for it's especially so like if you're pain and it's caused by a bacterial infection you would expect to find bacterial in the joint fluid and there's no good evidence that after treatment you still find those bacteria so if they've tried to culture it and nothing has happened yeah exactly for long term antibiotic use is not suffering from these symptoms there have been multiple studies which of shown no benefit of long term antibiotic use compared to a placebo and in some cases they are shown more harm than good can come from long term antibiotic use because antibiotics are not without their own risks like what like antibiotic resistance clearing out your own microbiome right disrupting your natural gut flora and things which can lead to secondary infections and then antibiotics also have a number of non-specific effects so they can be bad for your liver they can be bad for other organs they're not over all drugs that you want to take unless you really have to but the problem is people are still suffering and in some cases they might have been through a lot of testing and different drugs and who knows what else to try and get relief for their symptoms there's likely no shortage of doctors who are crappy listeners and just ignore or downplay or don't take seriously these kind of subjective complaints and I think that's in large part where so much of the frustration between people suffering from the symptoms and the medical community has come from its not feeling heard so the question then is what is actually causing the symptoms in people who have evidence of having had Lyme disease and were treated but are still miserable there is some evidence that these symptoms may be caused by autoimmune or inflammatory type reactions much in the way that rheumatic heart disease can be a manifestation following an infection with a bacteria called strep pyogenes or the way people can get Gian Beret syndrome after an infection with campylobacter right this is like a common theme in sections nomenon that's unique to Lime to think that maybe what's happening here is some kind of autoimmune or inflammatory reaction after treatment for Lyme bacteria and in fact some people with these persistent symptoms especially the joint type symptoms respond well to NSAIDs nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or to joint injections with steroids or in some cases to anti Rheumatic treatments these are things that we would normally give someone with something like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus this is evidence suggesting in favor of the idea that these post-treatment Lyme symptoms are indeed related to autoimmune or inflammatory disease not persistent infection and the issue is that we don't have a good handle on what borrelia is doing precisely inside of our bodies in the first place and we definitely don't have a good handle on what antigens it might be that we potentially could be making antibodies against that then lead to this sort of autoimmune flare up so because we don't have a good handle on what's going on that can be really frustrating cuz it means that we don't have very directed therapies right it's just like try ibuprofen see if that helps kind of it which is very unsatisfying yeah there's also there's a few other issues at play here and that is that so for one thing they're actually pretty high rates of co-infection both in the text and then it can be passed onto humans so there's co-infection between Morelia and other tick-borne illnesses many of which don't respond to the same antibiotics as lime so anaplasma which is one tick borne disease that can be Co it that it could become infected with and could therefore co-infected you with that's treated with Doxycycline but the be easier and tick borne viruses these things don't respond to the antibiotics that we used to treat Lyme so it's also possible that somebody could be adequately treated for Lyme but have another underlying infection that is untreated yeah but the thing I do want to stress in addition to what you said Aaron that it's not it's not like these symptoms aren't real and it we know that post-treatment symptoms can occur for a number of people the thing that I do want to point out is that also have been people treated for Lyme with these lime type symptoms who don't have any evidence of a Lyme infection and I think that those people sometimes get grouped into this chronic lyme or post-treatment Lyme and like we talked about earlier in terms of diagnosing Lyme while the test that we have to diagnose lyme are not perfect they're actually pretty good as long as you're testing late in the course of disease hypothetically speaking let's say that somebody was infected with borrelia yes they're going to test negative up into a certain point until their body starts making antibodies against beryllium then they will test negative on that serological test but after a week or two if you text him again they would be positive and then for the rest of their lives but they test positive pretty much yeah and so that is something that like you can't tell if the infection is necessarily an active infection versus you had it 10 years ago or something like that is someone tested positive with symptoms and had never been treated for Lyme they should be treated for Lyme but if they test positive but they've been treated for Lyme that's just residual antibodies it doesn't mean they have an active infection. You although there's some Nuance to that because there are early antibodies and then there are late antibodies but you can tell if you got re-infected for example but that's a different story it's also possible that happened to Brian that's basically lime in a nutshell that took show and it took show do you need a break I think I need to break I need a break this summer the best way to discover new ones you're guaranteed to love is with first place the wine club that uses your feedback to cure a wine selections to your unique tastes whether you're entertaining company or enjoying a warm summer night at home first Leaf makes buying great wine easy it really does have been loving this first leave situation because they give me such a wide selection that normally I would be way too afraid to venture out and this way it sort of like someone chooses it all for me who's knows that I do have it coming to my house and then I get to go online and say I love this one and I like this one a little less and then the next box is even better it's so fun it's really fun start by taking the first Leaf wine quiz to assess your exact wine-drinking preferences from sweetness to Wine styles to even how adventurous you are and trying new wines 2995 Andis wines are normally at least twenty bucks a piece then you taste and write your bottles online firstleaf takes your ratings and selects new lines based on your taste for your next shipment sign up with our link and you'll get this exclusive intro offer that's six bottles of wine for only 2995 plus free shipping just go to try first Leaf.

activities are now or at least they should be Full body screen for a tiny hitchhiking arthropod a tick check and if such a round Shader from your flesh at this point of Google fails to give you a satisfactory answers about the odds of you coming down with an infection or if you are simply spurred into action by the horror inducing headlines that flash across your screen you may schedule a doctor's appointment to confirm or assuage your fears and that's if you spot the check in the first place for many people if not most the horror only comes afterwards when your body starts to tell you something is wrong and the source of this wrongness the even tinier hitchhiker hidden inside the tiny tick hitchhiker borrelia burgdorferi cute it is kind of cute a genuinely beautiful Tech yes it's beautiful in its coloration and stuff but it doesn't it's not any less creepy and awful know and I will be the first to admit that as a person who study text for the last six or seven years they are creepy and I don't like fighting them on my body this fear of lime that this paranoia that surrounds tick bite these aren't deeply rooted things going back Millennia more of us like to get this thing off of me maybe but not sort of instant panic and fear that I think now is a lot more prevalent and that's because of lyme borreliosis is a recent emerging infectious disease and it's now one of the most common vector-borne diseases worldwide one and it's one that has surged and prevalence in the decade since it was given its name and so I'll go into some of the ideas as to how and why it seems to have spread so rapidly a but first let's try slime back to its roots as I usually do our favorite thing only goes back a few decades the disease itself and certainly the pathogen goes back a lot further goes back a lot further so dorky further are very different things but I wouldn't have done it correctly the history of borrelia burgdorferi and Lyme borreliosis are separate chapters of the same story so I'll start at the beginning okay the first chapter of pathogen as you mentioned Library Leo says can be caused by a number of different species of borrelia and that depends on where in the world you are it could be borrelia burgdorferi eyes and sister s l e a r n e i b l e a spill many I and many others with more being described all the time and this diversity of borrelia species causing infection humans and the existence of multiple strains within a species Point towards this being a very old group of bacteria and that's supported by genomic research so by comparing the breyley is found in infected people and infected ticks from all over the world and an overlaying that with the geographic location of the infection researchers could point out not just how long to buy cherry I have been around but also when they went from point A to point B and just what those points A and B are so here's a general disclaimer that this is an area of active research so conclusions aren't necessarily firm and that's probably something I should just say for as a blanket statement for this entire section but yeah but a few things do stand out in this research so okay so we have a bunch of really a species that cause disease in humans some of which are only found in North America and some of which are only found in Europe or Asia and some that are found in both places are just found in Europe are likely of European origin pretty simple and those that are found in North America likely North American origin but what district o which is found in both places it's not as super clerestory here but it seems moderately more likely that this species originated in Europe and then was introduced to North America several times and how that happened is still a bit of a mystery since humans are considered a dead end host for the disease which means that it's extremely unlikely that an uninfected larvie will feed on a human and activist borrelia and then become infected itself and then able to introduce a disease into the ecosystem so late yeah they don't contribute to the disease cycle wow yeah I mean that makes a lot of sense but I never really thought about it was something like West Nile it's like obviously humans are dead end but I never really felt about it great job disease ecologist yeah so that means it that makes it more confusing cuz if you imagine the human migrations to North America it's unlikely that that would be the source of infection there right and soda maybe what about something like birds but K apparently there aren't very many bird species that migrate east to west so it's more north to south generally speaking and then maybe so maybe some seabirds could do the trick but that really hasn't been fully investigated okay so still some questions there but that does seem to be multiple introductions from Europe to North America what's the time skilled I'm talking about here when is all of this taking place over thousands and thousands of years oh yeah one said it puts the most recent common ancestor of borrelia burgdorferi at 60,000 years ago yeah and other studies agree that the bacterium existed in North America and pre-columbian times wow I was ready thrilled to read this what about any physical evidence of borrelia burgdorferi is ancient Ness yeah that's a word for sure that's the word couple of bullfighting have you ever heard of The tyrolean Iceman he was found in 1991 in the Italian Alps and was estimated to be about 5,300 years old okay he had brown eyes type O blood lactose intolerance and it an increased risk for coronary heart disease and probably died a violent death judging from the arrowhead that was lodged into his shoulder and also he probably had Lyme borreliosis candles that animals the researchers who analyzed his genome for all of those traits that I just listed also look for bacteria and they found evidence for infection with borrelia burgdorferi 50 years before the cluster of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis cases in Lyme Connecticut that's very cool that's very cool we haven't had a ice mommy or anything in a while on this shows and ticks for evidence of borrelia infection and in Germany and Exodia Crescenta stick from 1884 tested positive for borrelia and several Exodia scapularis text from Long Island New York elected to the 1940s were also found to carry the bacterium cool a couple of white footed mice for Massachusetts that died or were collected in a 94 also tested positive for borrelia was to show you that these bacterial species have been around and widespread multiple continents for Millennia and so are likely to have caused disease in humans throughout that time but like I said the story of burrelli the story of lyme borreliosis are two separate chapters in the same story so when did humans first recognized borreliosis as a disease spoiler alert it wasn't in Lyme Connecticut in the 1970s it wasn't the 19 hundreds at all four in North America chapter 2 the disease the story of lyme starts in Lyme Connecticut and the US in the 1970s right now what you just said it doesn't correct it was my leading question forgot the story that I'm guessing most people in North America are most familiar with but it's really only part of the story and it's definitely not the beginning the disease that we know as Lyme disease was actually first described 92 years before it was given that name a German physician noticed that several people were presenting with a chronic skin disorder and he named it let's see acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans yeah we did and his description didn't Fade Into Obscurity throughout Europe Physician's for finding people that had this rash and by the early 1910s it was proposed that this rash was caused by a tick bite just goes right back okay so the rash might be a pretty easy one to spot and then associate with a tick bite but what about the neurological or arthritic symptoms those were also described long before Lyme disease had been coined as a name in 1922 to French neurologist published a case study of someone with borrelia infection of the central nervous system and the link between the rash in the neurological symptoms was made in 1930 Again by a German doctor right after World War II when antibiotics started to be widely used a Swedish doctor named Arvid as silius which sounds like a name from Harry Potter and also is as far as I could see your little light bulb turn on agent of lyme borreliosis in northern Europe fattest neighborly SLE SLE is treated dozens of his patients that had the characteristic rash and followed up with them for two years and found that 70% had fully recovered once he treated with Penicillin fabulous over the next few decades leading up to the discovery of the cluster of cases in Lyme Connecticut researchers and Physicians both of them European continue to work on getting the full picture of this disease they had described its chronic rash and linked it to persistent neurological symptoms they had concluded it was infectious most likely bacterial because of how it responded to antibiotics and they thought it was most likely tick-borne so the only thing missing was the bacterial agent itself so this is all have been done almost a hundred years Okay so let's head to Lyme Connecticut in the 1970s in the small Athleta town of about 2000 people neighbors begin to talk something strange was happening to the kids of lime several have been diagnosed with something called juvenile rheumatoid I cannot say that quickly juvenile juvenile rheumatoid arthritis tongue twister it feels like me trying to say Giardia. Just saying oh how the turntables so juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition where your joints become damaged and inflamed when your white blood cells attack the healthy tissues there a lot of other autoimmune diseases it's not super clear on what causes the self attack it's a painful condition but it had been well described for quite a while so what was strange about these particular cases in Lime then simply was the number of them only about 1 in 50,000 or 1 in 75,000 children are diagnosed with JRA so when there were several in a town of 2008 threw up some red flags researchers at Yale were notified of his cases and they concluded that there was a statistical cluster in lime and that there was probably something going on in the challenge have caused the sudden rise in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis could it be an environmental contaminant outbreak of some foodborne illness or a new infectious disease the first two were pretty quickly ruled out and so that left infectious agent it was time to talk to the patients to see if there was anything else linking them it turned out that these kids had all had a skin rash just a couple of weeks before developing the joint pain and arthritis so they suspected the chura linked the researchers began tracking new people who came in with similar skin rashes and found that several later also developed joint pain at the same time other researchers were doing some deep dives into Old literature where they found some articles from the late 1800s describing the same thing the link between this disease that had been previously described in Europe and this new disease wasn't solid by their eyes and so researchers gave this new one a new name Lyme disease to indicate where it was found even though shortly after that first lime cluster was investigated a bunch more kids all over New England were found to have this condition by the late 1970s the Yale researchers had put together a pretty compelling case that this disease was caused by a bacterium transmitted by a tick bite wow the only thing missing were the two smoking guns toward the bacterium and a Tec but they didn't have long to wait because at the same time as the lot of things happening all at the same time that the same time that these researchers were tracking their cases other researchers were looking chicks around that same area but for different reasons they have been looking for the tick species that transmits rickettsia rickettsii is the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever but they had much more success fighting a different tick ixodes scapularis in this in the New England area they thought maybe this also carries the rickettsia responsible for Rocky Mountain spotted fever and so they sent them to Willy burgdorfer lab for testing Willie didn't find rickettsia rickettsii I but he did find another type of bacterium called a spirochete and this wasn't like one or two ticks with the bacterium this was an infection problems but 60% wow very high so maybe he thought this could be the line bacterium so his lab culture that they tested it on lab animals and they found that it caused a limelight disease they named it borrelia burgdorferi by to honor the key discover willy willy agent an arthropod Vector had been identified work could start on the medical side of things using antibiotics to treat the disease and also on the ecological side of things understanding what animals and habitats led to the transmission of the disease so that people could actually try to start controlling or preventing spread this also meant that researchers could test for it until and human and animal samples which is when they finally concluded that what they had on their hands was not a new disease at all not even a newly described one strictly speaking because there was a match between the North American and European cases the barela's were found all over what was happening are we witnessing the emergence of a brand new disease on two continents simultaneously the answer is yes and no Lyme disease definitely fits the definition of an emerging disease because it's something that is increasing rapidly and a. Of time and new Geographic areas and increasing in prevalence but as we know this certainly was not a new pathogen or a new disease so what led to the sudden uptick in cases uptick I didn't even realize but up to you and would it ever stop to answer these questions let's talk ecology a beautiful intro to just to be able to get to talk about the Ecology of life play thank you thank you so much is very nicely done chapter 3 ecology I might be biased but I feel that as a field disease ecology owes a lot to Lyme disease because in many ways that you can logical complexity of that disease system made researchers look at it not just from the perspective of an entomologist study biology or an epidemiologist setting exposure patterns or a microbiologist studying borrelia burgdorferi all of those perspectives tossing and species interactions and the impact environmental variables and yeah other things just to get a glimpse into how infection happened yeah I agree but even though I'm just use system is complicated and a lot of different factors artwork that doesn't mean that it's impossible to understand so let's work our way upward I want to start with the system itself introducing the pathogen tick and hosts and then talk about the timing of Lyme disease emergent so why it started popping up when it did awesome so for Lyme disease we have three players to consider the tick the pathogen and the host let's start with a thick chicks are obligate active parasites which basically just means that they need host to survive and they live on the outside of their host spending most of their lives in the environment a chick starts its life as a little egg waiting patiently and the environment until conditions are just right for it to hatch into a larva and start looking for an animal to feed on borrelia isn't transmitted from a mother tick to her Offspring so all of these larval ticks are free from borrelia infection if you are bitten by a larval tick it is extraordinary really unlikely that you will get Lyme borreliosis from it that's important there are other things you can get of course like Rocky Mountain spotted fever but we won't go into that on this episode the different different so anyway this larvae is an innocent that will most likely an innocent uninfected little parasites still sucking your blood but if you don't like in your butt but you know it needs that needs you to survive whose Little Liars are all it's looking for is a host let's say that that hoe said it finds is a white-footed mouse if we're the us or a bankfull if we're in Finland for both of these animals are notoriously good at being infected with so if that larvae has a nice juicing meal on one of those guys it's going to fall off completely sated and utterly infected with borrelia ticks only feed one time during each of their life stages so that little engorged larvae is going to just chill out in the environment until it molten to the next stage which is called a nymph that is nymph is the one you're going to want to watch out for Lyme disease researcher is often use the density of infected nymphs so like how many nips on average are infected in a certain area like 100 square meters as a measure of disease risk and that's because Nims can be infected and I are more numerous in the environment compared to adults and are more likely to bite humans and if so you should doll-like will post a picture but also do yourself a favor and look up the size differences of larvae nymph an adult yeah just to you know inform yourself at Six Flags name some adults have eight legs yeah a little army of Exodia scapulars are so tiny I feel like you won't even see them. Super tiny is Bo Jackson play anyway so it's usually one of these nymphs one of these little creeps that's responsible for making you sick if that infected nymph bites say another mouse or a bank full rather than a human it will pass on the borrelia while it's still leading to another infected rodent or host and another full and happy tick which is still infected it doesn't lose the infection over its life that again children environment eventually molting into a male or a adult female tick these adult text tend to be a bit pickier and their tastes choosing a larger hosts like deer over rodents or humans although that still does occasionally happen once on this larger host a love story and Sue's the male and female lock eyes over their shared blood meal gazing at each other through the strands of Tawny deer fur until they're both fall and they can have their moment dear ya don't tear I can't right now I'm sorry I'm sorry I love it after their moment they drop off the host the female lays eggs and then dies and a cycle starts a new pretty simple and turn into adults adults rapid fire yeah there you go there is nothing new about the way that ticks carry out this lifecycle they have been doing it for Millennia nor is there anything new about the bacteria themselves as we've learned to their ancient so that begs the question why now what has been happening in the past 50 years to lead to the emergence of what is now the most common tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere the answer does not lie and conspiracy theories about bioweapons surprise surprise it's simply in the Ecology of the system and it to me it's much more interesting and not to mention actually based on facts then a wild America Centric story created to sell books in the interest of not overgeneralizing I am going to concentrate on the North American emergence of the pathogen which does have some parallels to what happened in Europe okay so before Columbus came over and started the devastation of the people in land of North America the lime pie terium probably existed in the same cycle that it does today that many large forests allowed for higher populations of host like deer and mice that could support the ticks and of pathogens then after colonization the woods turned into a resource which was used almost to the point of exhaustion deer and other large mammals the host that are great for producing more ticks were hunted until their numbers dwindled and tick populations probably also dropped a bit patches of forest with deer and ticks remained in places such as Long Island and some islands off Massachusetts where Brasilia probably also head out the mid-twentieth century saw a big reversal of Fortune for deer and forests large areas were reforested and deer populations were being reintroduced every at the same time the human population was growing and I had to have somewhere to live this led to the suburbs neighborhoods being built right next to or in place of forests the barrier between humans and deer or just humans and other Wildlife species shrank as a Suburban spread continued with all of these deer ticks now how to amplify two feet on which meant that the chances of a human and countering a tick was much more likely these things set the stage for the seemingly sudden reappearance of Lyme disease even though we know it's been around a lot longer but it's not a simple equation of more deer equals more Lyme disease so don't go blaming the deer it's probably more of a threshold thing an area might need just a few dear to keep tick populations plentiful and noticed that I'm also just talking about deer and ticks and deer and borrelia that's because there's a key element to the Lyme disease system that makes it a whole lot more complex than just more hoes equals more disease because not all hosts a shine. All hosts are I won't do that no please do that are equally good at being infected with borrelia in disease ecology terms we would say that hosts vary in their Reservoir competence deer not-so-good white-footed mice and Bank Foles fantasy Western Fence lizards terrible worst opossums terrible horrible Eastern Chipmunks great beautiful there's a lot of variation depending on the host species and it's a spectrum yeah those those terms by the way we're beautiful at being a host for Burrell AKA horrible for humans right so Western Fence lizards being terrible at being reservoirs yes to remember that a larval tick turns into an infected nymph by feeding on an infected host if the host that that larva feeds on is a good Reservoir like a white-footed mouse meaning that that Mouse is probably chock-full of Aurelia The Tick will probably become infected because chances are that host is infected but if the host of choice is a poor Reservoir like a western fence lizard that lizard is probably uninfected and so that it probably won't become infected so it's not just about the number of hosts that are present in an area it's about which hosts are present and in what proportions yeah done such like a deep ecology episode of 4 in this is just really exciting it's really exciting and also it's like it's I think so crucial to understand in understanding the patterns of Lyme disease and there's just such a big like there's so many pieces to this puzzle it's fascinating try the general rule the newly forested regions and the forest fragments created by suburbs and development in general they tend to be species poor and the species that are they are predictable guess what they're often great reservoirs Manning highly infected like the white-footed mice or important for tick populations like whitetail deer I told you you're great at living in urban or Suburban areas to the destruction that we are much more likely to feed on a host that is a good Reservoir and the prevalence of borrelia will likely climb and climb and the density of infected nymphs will be high these areas are often the closest to humans where people live or picnic or Garden or simply go for a walk in larger more undisturbed areas with higher biodiversity there are more species there and a larval tick has many different host to choose from and some of these hosts are going to be less likely to be infected in these more intact biodiverse Forest the density of infected Nims is likely lower than in those Forest fragments to this idea the idea that higher biodiversity reduces disease spread is called the dilation effect the definition of fact is definitely a controversial or at least contentious issue in disease ecology there is a disease that I wish in effect or increase disease in humans called the amplification effect and what is actually happening is that both can happen it just depends its ecology it depends on a diseased system the location to scale the time frame so many things but in the case of Lyme disease there are many studies that show that the dilution effect is likely what's happening in eastern North America yeah so in those Forest fragments when you have low biodiversity that house that tend to be there the house of the ticks are feeding on are likely infected and great at being infected and that causes a higher disease risk for humans eat one more reason for people to care about biodiversity and stopping habitat loss what a beautifully complex ecology that Lyme disease has let's talk about the bio-weapon conspiracy theory that's been in the news lately I just love it talks about the history and ecology you agree that this conspiracy has makes no sense and has no basis in fact different and red different variations of this conspiracy but the basic story is that in an attempt to make vile weapons the US government either cooked up borrelia burgdorferi and purposely infected text with it and release those texts or just infected and released text with borrelia burgdorferi this seemingly sudden emergence and spread of Lyme disease over the past 50 years North America is because of this bioweapon experiment gone wrong according to the conspiracy theory okay so this idea doesn't make sense for a number of reasons here are just a few number one ticks would make terrible bio weapons does something that really really grinds my gears is like if you're going to make a bioweapon you would like and you wouldn't want us to be a vector absolutely not absolutely not not gorilla in ticks which have to be attached for at least twenty-four to thirty-six hours to even cause infection they also ticks high maintenance they need a lot of things like the right environmental conditions the appropriate hosted a high enough densities and then they would still have to bite someone but yeah it doesn't make any sense. Number two is Lyme disease isn't fatal by weapons program tend to focus on the diseases that will actually kill you and are not curable so what would the purpose be releasing a disease that is fully treatable with antibiotics And has a very very very very low fatality rate even when untreated though it has chronic symptoms for sure if it's right treated it's very low fatality rate that's often not causing chronic symptoms in a population who are fun be lucky enough to get bitten by a tick is not often the goal of fire weapons programs number 3 Lyme disease certainly wasn't cooked up in a lab it's been around for Millennia as we know a lot of the bioweapon conspiracy theories leaned heavily on the sudden emergence of the cluster of cases and Lyme Connecticut but how many of them talked about the person in 1970 and Central Wisconsin that was described as having erythema migrans after a tick bite he got while grouse hunting the Doctor Who treated him guess it was caused by a spirochete bacterium so he treated it with Penicillin okay wait that's awesome if right yeah right. Doesn't get enough credit I know and how many of these conspiracy books are articles mentioned the presence of Lyme disease in your where was described and treated long before the lime plaster our hands are up in the air you guys are up in the air just even if we're purposely infected and released it wouldn't be enough to explain the sudden global increase in the disease this is a very American Centric conspiracy theory that has no support from Lyme borreliosis researchers no support whatsoever my personal conspiracy theory about this conspiracy theory is that the people who are promoting it are not willing to accept the role that humans have played in the wide-scale environmental change including climate change that has set the stage for Lyme borreliosis emergency which is so funny like let's blame just a small group of people instead of all of humanity okay so anyway the answer to any ecological question about Lyme disease could start with it depends how will climate change impact the spread of Lyme's disease it depends it depends on the scale of your question neighborhood County State country it depends on what climate change projections are looking at depends on the animals in a region what we do know is that it will change as a climate changes and there are so many different aspects of the Lyme disease system that need to be examined before we can understand enough about what's going on in a region to make any predictions the biology of the pathogen in a tech the environmental conditions affecting tick survival the types of host species that are there the human behavior leading to exposure all of these things into and this complexity I think has contributed a lot to the controversy surrounding the disease as well as the frustrations of people who feel as if they're being lied to or at the very least I talked in the section about the history of the pathogen and the history of Lyme disease but I didn't really touch on how Lyme disease has been perceived the medical community since being discovered which is a big part of its history and I think it's something that's really important to talk about because Lyme disease is a very controversial issue and it's important to examine why that controversy exists when a new disease shows up it can take a while before anyone recognizes it as something new and then even longer before there's a treatment for it and if you've listened to this podcast before that probably sounds really familiar in Lime that Journey towards pathogen Discovery was relatively quick after the cluster of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis cases in Lyme Connecticut was identified but then figuring out how to describe Lyme disease as an infection took a little bit longer because of the wide variety of symptoms that can cause and then figuring out what might be happening long after the breyley are gone and no longer causing an active infection was even trickier and people are still trying to puzzle that out yeah definitely in the beginning even recognizing that there could be autoimmune symptoms triggered by borrelia took time back in the mid-1990s the Infectious Disease Society of America did not do a great job of acknowledging people who are suffering and seeking help and some people on the receiving end of that didn't respond well either making death threats or verbally attacking researchers really happened sounds like it was Madness yeah chaos and this Clash this chaos kind of set the tone for what is unfortunately still a big part of the Lyme disease conversation today come a long way and what we know about how the disease Works in Erin I think you did a really good job talking about long term antibiotic use and how it won't actually help someone who does not have an active Bradley infection and how it's actually hurt them and I feel like a lot of this controversy is because the terminology that we use and a science that we have based it on is still being developed we know so much more now than we did 20 or even 10 years ago but it takes time for that information and in particular that terminology and the science behind it to trickle down to Physicians and also to people who aren't in any medical field whatsoever yeah and in a way it's not that surprising then that Lyme disease would have led to such controversy because you really need a huge Foundation of knowledge to understand the Ecology of the system as well as the biology of the pathogen which is something we're still grappling with it's an incredibly complex disease and even though we know a lot there's still a lot that we don't know and this this lack of knowledge is a really common theme in a lot of chronic or autoimmune diseases that don't have a very clear pathology or a treatment that we figured out yet especially those with subjective symptoms that we can't quantify well the more mysterious diseases the more we don't understand it the more gray areas that end up surrounding it and that's especially the case when we're dealing with as I mentioned is nonspecific subjective symptoms of disease and our last episode on cystic fibrosis I talked a bit about language and disease and how is so hard to know what someone means when they say they're tired or when they're in pain or when their brain is foggy because those are things that might feel different to each person and so I think that can make them be more easily dismissed at the same time you know yourself and you are Baseline in a way that no one else can which means you would probably know when things are Beyond normal and so then being told no this is normal this is just normal wear and tear that must be incredibly frustrating yeah when you go to a physician because you have something wrong with you but you don't know what that is I feel like you have to basic expectations one the doctor will be able to tell you what's wrong with you and to they will be able to help you get better or at least try and I think these are reasonable expectations because over our lives we go to the doctor and we get treated this is sort of the situation that we have experienced all of our lives so that that's that's what we expecting that has made us have trust and confidence in our physicians and the medical establishment has a hole so then when you're told we don't know what's wrong with you or you've been treated so your symptoms should have gone away or we can't find anything wrong with you it's no wonder that it feels like you're being dismissed or outright ignored not having a diagnosis sucks because that feels hopeless yeah it really does and I can only imagine how frustrating that must be for Physicians as well because there is so little you do for your patience if you can't figure out what's wrong right and that's often what happens in a lot of these chronic illnesses not only in Lyme disease and I think part of the problem has become that in some cases a diagnosis of Lyme disease has been made based on exclusion and Lyme disease is not and should not be a diagnosis of exclusion it shouldn't be that just because we can't figure out what's what else is going on to cause your symptoms that we then call it Lyme disease that's what a diagnosis of exclusion is well we've tested for everything that we can think of and we can't find what's going on so you have Lyme disease that's not accurate for because contrary to some of the information on the internet we actually can diagnose lyme so by diagnosing somebody with Lyme disease based on these exclusion criteria alone without laboratory confirmation it can actually make it a lot harder for people who have had confirmed diagnosis of lyme and who are still suffering from these post-treatment symptoms cuz I think it conflates these groups and makes it really hard for us to even study from a scientific perspective what's going on so that we can develop better treatments yeah that's that's a really good point yeah it's a it's a really the whole thing is a very everything but you really complex issues but big-time what we need to talk about next Aaron I think is the scope of this okay what is actually going on in the world of lion both in terms of epidemiology and also some maybe medical advancements maybe with some cool Cutting Edge ecological research but maybe we'll take a we need a breather first I think so let's take a breather which

hellofresh.com this podcast this podcast 8 0 so let's talk about the epidemiology of lyme Lyme borreliosis in the US 40 mm cases reported wow that's a lot more than I expected and it's estimated that the actual number is probably closer to 300,000 yeah I've seen that number Wiley it's a big number it's a huge number and lime is a reportable disease so those 42,000 cases that were reported like those are all the people who were basically treated for Lyme disease essentially right so it's estimated that there's a lot more people who never get seen and therefore never get reported or traded do we know what proportion of people can clear the infection good question about being treated no clue but I mean based on if we're estimating that three hundred thousand cases are happening every year and only forty-two thousand people are getting treatment I would say it's probably pretty high right right I would guess that for a large proportion of people it's a a relatively self-limiting disease okay but that's a guess don't quote me on it please in Europe there's not a great aggregate data in general so you can go country-by-country but that's a lot to do so in a paper from 2016 they estimated that there was probably around 235,000 cases annually across Western Europe yeah that seems low compared to the estimates for the numbers in the US but I don't know in the UK there's an estimated 3000 cases annually okay and then in places like Germany Austria and Sweden the numbers are quite a bit higher than 3,000 so I don't have the exact numbers noticed you left out Finland I did I didn't find good numbers on Finland that's different numbers this is my favorite because okay listen in Canada lime is the most prevalent tick-borne disease most prevalent vector-borne disease right in guess how many cases there were in 2015 in Canada that huge amount of country that's okay but if there were three hundred thousand in the US let's say 50917 what 917 cases reported in Canada in 2015 however that is a crap ton more than in 2009 when only a hundred and forty four cases were reported in all of Canada wow isn't that so meaning that increase is a factor of both the tick Vector spreading northwards cuz of climate change and also Diagnostic and people reading articles and saying I'm going to go get treated her go talk to a doctor you say that the disease has been reported in other places as well really complicated when were looking at Vino especially Geographic reports of the disease but that's one reason that we're probably seeing increases is just getting better at recognizing it but the tick is spreading and the disease is also spreading so the real question is why is it that we are seeing this increase in spread not only in the US but across the globe and I'm not going to answer that question for you because we have with us today someone with a lot more knowledge on the subject who can tell us about the ways that we interact with our environment and the effect that ecology climate change Etc Forest fragmentation urbanization all of these awesome big picture questions what do they have to do with the increase in Lyme disease so let's ask our favorite our favorite advisor in the whole world dr. Brian Fallon take it away is amazing because it's received a huge amount of attention from colleges and epidemiologist it's arguably the most prevalent vector-borne disease in North America the economic and health impacts are enormous and so despite the amount of attention is received we're still making new discoveries in the ecology Lyme disease in so it's been really a productive system for my biological standpoint what it has told us about the role of infectious agents in ecological communities and the way humans can disrupt ecological communities and influence the risk of exposure to a tick-borne disease Lyme disease has been just really eliminating there is this intersection between the applied and basic research when it comes to Lyme disease because it's as human health problem and so I think one of the big areas going forward is going to be just understand why does lyme disease continue to grow both an incident so the number of people who are reported getting Lyme disease every year but also the spatial distribution of expanding as well and so the tick is spreading the pathogen is spreading that is biologically an interesting problem because we don't fully understand how that's happening so we don't think that these chicks are capable of any kind of significant dispersal on their own and where's the pathogen write the pathogens by the residing in the tick or it's residing in one of the animal that was one of Herbert house so it must be some movements of wildlife facilitated by humans are influenced by humans that's allowing the tick in the pathogens spread to new areas and so the Frontiers I think one clue how does climate change influence the spread of taking pathogen but also how did humans modify their landscapes in ways that can affect the distribution of a Lyme disease system as well another really interesting aspect of this is that why does he is really the big tick-borne disease on our radar initially because it was causing so many cases but through the study of the biology or ecology Lyme disease we discovered that there are a number of other pathogens that are transmitted by this particular species of ticks the black-legged tick is also shine Spotlight that there are other ticks in North America and other diseases associated with them as well and so I was probably at least 15 tick-borne diseases that occur in North America that are associated with several different species that they're all biologically someone different from each other and so how much does what we know about the biology Lyme disease which we understand really well at this point how much does that apply to the other tick-borne agents versus how much for these all idiosyncratic and similar levels of effort need to be put into studying each of these two diseases to understand their biology in their control so what do you think is going on in terms of the spread of the ticks and the pathogens like why how how are these take some pathogens getting from point A to point B and how is that different depending on where you're looking I mean if you look in North America in the Northeast that might be different than if you look in the west or if you look in Europe and other places like what do you think are there any general rules here there's been a lot of research looking at what Wildlife hosts might be involved in the dispersal of both of ticks in the pathogens and it is if it's a really interesting landscape that probably suggests there will be major differences among the tick borne diseases in from the how they spread through the landscape so for example there's been a impressive research on the role of migratory songbirds in the dispersal of ticks and pathogens and it's not saying something people typically think about when they think about song bird migrations you have these birds flying overhead and the typical When you have millions of birds flying overhead you actually have millions of ticks flying overhead as well so you have the timing of the spring in the fall migrations and to what extent that aligns with the timing of the different stages in the ticks life cycle in determine which tick life stages are being dispersed in which direction and then some of those birds are also capable of transmitting the line pathogen the ticks and others are not as though it's under some scenarios you can have a tick being dispersed without the pathogen which that take is then annoying or nuisance but it's not much of a health risk vs ticks being dispersed with the pathogen and then you have a scenario where you have infected animals dispersing the pathogen without the tick that if they arrive someplace where the takes her establish than they can be bitten and and start the cycle their number of different Pathways by which you can have the spread of either the 10th or the pathogen or the tick and a pathogen so that's pretty cool some of the work from the Northeast indicates that Lyme disease is spreading faster than another tick borne is Babies R Us in humans and that's because of the wildlife hosts that are what we refer to as the reservoirs for those the pathogens that cause those illnesses and a case of babies with small mammals that don't disperse long distances and so babies use this is spreading slowly where is Lyme disease can be carried by wildlight that travel much further distances and stove eye diseases spreading fast the extent to which climate change has one form of of human environmental change will impact these processes in part depends on the timing of when Wildlife migrate the timing of the tick life cycle and so that's that's an area where there's a lot of active research going on trying to project into the future what can we expect for the distribution of tick-borne disease under environmental change don't whistle this information and research about Invasion and how ticks and the pathogens spread into new areas is there any ecological research being done on how to use this information to actually control the disease itself like are there any interesting bits of research in that Arena and so just knowing where these diseases are occurring is actually one of the most useful pieces of information we can provide because a surprising extent of the public health effort against tick-borne diseases like Lyme disease still depends on good biological information on where risk is high and we're risk is low and suppositions understand when a patient comes in describing symptoms that could potentially apply to a number of different illnesses what are the chances that they might be really lacking for good distribution information and so that's actually been a big Focus these last few years with a push from the CDC is to try to get better distribution maps for the ticks in the pathogen so that we can really cheap the Public Health Community updated on where these occur but there are interventions and and control measures that have been proposed their efficacy is also an ongoing area of study so a technology that was developed several decades ago but hasn't seen that widespread deployment is different types of traps is not quite the right word but something that brings wildlife in to get a reward like a feeding station and then they get a pesticide applied to them when they come in for the bait and so their versions of these for deer which treaty or against text either also versions that can be used for mice and some of the other small mammals that are these critical hose for the line pathogen and so there are challenges on the deployment of those over large spatial scales but it's possible that in areas that are particularly high risk or where we're seeing a lot of human cases those could be adequately deployed another controversy in the ecology Lyme disease is how critical is deer population size and that has been a focus of Lyme disease research for a long time but it's a surprisingly tough question to answer and so if you have high deer population density that always equate High Lyme disease risk the date is just not always and so in the context of deer management often comes up some communities not necessarily just because of Lyme disease that can be also because of vehicle collisions and and other concerns but Lyme disease particularly in areas where is endemic is often proposes a reason and so another area where there's a will there's no research is to address to what extent of these deer management programs also manage Lyme disease risk so there are there are things communities can do I think educating the public about the level of risk and from what I've seen from the public health literature is that getting people to engage in preventive measures is still win the most effective things the scientific Community can do and so if we can get people that probably would be more to reduce wine disease cases than just about any other strategy I have a question that I think you probably get asked all the time cuz I have been asked it frequently why do ticks matter why can't we just kill them all what would happen if I want to hear your take on this this is also probably the most verses that uniform Nature's perspective there isn't good or bad these are organisms that are occupying and open ecological niche and parasitism is one of the most common strategies in nature that there's many species on Earth that have adopted a parasitic strategy because it works and so your nature doesn't think in terms of good or bad we find chicks a nuisance and they make a 6 so we have a very negative perception of text I understand and you know from the perspective of ecosystems I've seen the argument made and I've seen some data that is that in the absence of predators one can expect an increase in the abundance of parasites and so it's actually a really interesting paper that came out a few years ago showing at the extirpation of the gray wolf from North America probably released Lyme disease caused an increase in Deer populations and also indirectly an increasing populations of small mammals and as a result that might have set the stage for the emergence of Lyme disease and so in the absence of top predators in ecosystems what you may see emerging their place are in abundance of parasites and so this is all in some ways may be consequences of the way humans have modified the ecosystems in which we live so you have been directly impacted by disease and yet still study ticks constantly what are your favorite and least favorite parts of studying ticks and tick ecology is that most Expedia she's or many tick species anyway we'll feed on a wide diversity of different Wildlife hosts and so by studying chicks I get to study many different organisms. Just ticks and so I built myself as a tick biologist in that that serve me well but I really do find it interesting the way ticks connect many of the organisms within the ecosystem in which they occur and so I am able to study how much greater diversity of wildlife is a result of working on ticks least favorite part you know if I hear from a lot of people who are suffering from serious illness including people who haven't been able to get the treatment they need to feel better I feel bad for people who are suffering from long-term illness from tick-borne disease and I'm not a physician I'm not really able to offer them anything other than my sympathy and I hope through the research I do I can make things better for people who haven't yet been exposed to disease but it is heartbreaking Sometimes some people are very sick. Call Brian took us two full seasons to get him on the show I think we were just waiting for the right moment and this is the right moment this was the right moment thanks Brian everything for literally the last six years of our life so here and there's more like medical things so right like can you tell me any updates about the on the medical side of lime is there a vaccine in the works why do dogs get vaccines great questions yeah so there is a vaccine for dogs you can get it for your dogs I think for your cats as well I got it for my dog because she runs around and gets bit by ticks even though she's on tick prevention and things like that why not might as well there used to be a vaccine for humans used to be used to be it was relatively effective from what I can tell what is relatively effective I'm not sure exactly what the effectiveness was but it was like more than 50% effective but okay meaning that like more than 50% of people if you gave them the Saxon wood mount in response and then not get infected with the line pathogen okay but there was a theoretical fear used that giving the sex scene would increase the risk of lyme arthritis because it's very likely that Lyme arthritis is an autoimmune response and not directly caused by the pathogen so this is not an unreasonable idea that may be giving a killed version of this bacteria in some way would activate that same sort of immune response there wasn't any actual evidence in any clinical trials that this happened but after that idea was raised there was like no market for the vaccine and the manufacturers weren't making any money so they stopped making it that's it so it does that did it become unlicensed anything like that I think it's been so much time so much time has passed that it's not it's no longer license vaccine it's no longer available for human so there is no human Lyme vaccine I think that's hilarious assume then are there any research groups that are working on a vaccine or anything like that there probably aren't I had a hard time finding them so there is like things that you can find on like different Lyme vaccine patents and things like that let me check clinicaltrials.gov really quickly actually so there was a paper that came out in 2017 that was analyzing the past line vaccines that have existed and kind of trying to guide the way for further vaccine development but yeah it's it's really interesting but I'm vaccine used to exist maybe it will again do you know why it was not highly effective is there since he was strain diversity of lyme was it in with her only borrelia burgdorferi why I think it was only borrelia burgdorferi I think it was pretty effective though new infections in vaccinated adults by nearly 80% of 80% so yeah it was almost 80% effective but then they withdrew sales this is a great keeper I will post this Lyme vaccine at cautionary tale I'm curious I'd like to read that yeah we didn't touch at all in the episode really about the Pacific coast side of Lyme disease and the ticks that transmit they are in the host that are there are entirely different than on the Northeast Coast and if you want to hear more about that I would recommend an episode of ologies that features none other than dr. Andrea who's fantastic and she talks a lot about her research on Lyme disease on the Pacific coast so if people are interested they should definitely check out that episode of ologies yeah that's a good recommendation should I sit on the medical side of things that sit on the medical side of things but this episode I did too I tick-borne diseases and vector-borne diseases are fascinating because of how complex they are and it's a little bit daunting to try to learn each New Testament and all of the different terminology Reservoir competence and tick host and blah blah blah but I think it's just such an amazing thing to try to leave like tease apart all of these strands and that's I mean that's ecology like his disease ecology at its most beautiful yeah I agree so sources sources okay so I read a few different books and a bun clothes for this one books that I definitely want to shout out is called Lyme disease Ecology of a complex system and its by this is by Ricky spelled and she is is the most knowledgeable Lyme disease person I think he has been doing Lyme disease research and has teased apart so much of ecology so this is a really well-written understandable and fact-based book in David quammen spillover there's a great chapter on Lyme disease called the deer the parrot and the Kid Next Door super fun and then a bunch of papers on all post them all I do want to point out that there are some books out there that are not reliable and represent a lot of non scientific information that's not based on fact or on the research that has wide consensus among lime researchers and this is a real problem because what they do what some of these books do is use scientific language and they use interviews the scientist to bolster whatever arguments they're trying to portray or whatever story they're trying to sell then this makes finding reliable information very difficult and read a few of these books because I wanted to explore this realm and I am going to list of here as a way of saying hey these are some that are not reliable yeah one is called mime the first epidemic of climate change by Mary Beth Pfeiffer and the other is called lab 257 and that's by Michael C Carol and I found in both of these books what seemed to be a lack of understanding of the Lyme disease system which made me doubt The credibility of the rest of the books yeah I think that's really important because it's hard enough to find good information out there you expect that if it's a book it's legit so right that we need to remember is that there is no peer review process for publishing non-scientific books the way there is for these journals which have to go through pretty rigorous screening of the size of the study design of the interpretation of the analysis is all of these things even then there's sometimes wrong and so then with books there's not even a screening no surround that can be very tricky to the know where to find the right information or correct information I have several really great articles a few what a really really great one by that I really enjoyed by John Halpern that's addressing a lot of the common misconceptions about Lyme disease that's the title common misconceptions about Lyme disease wonderful it was published in 2013 and then there are several other reviews that I found that were super comprehensive and really easy to read if you want some just really good info about Lyme disease in general so we will post the links to these sources as always on our website this podcast will kill you. Com you can find every source that we sight from every single one of our episodes and we would like to thank Brian once again for coming onto the podcast we really appreciate it was so much fun it was so fun to have you would like to thank Bloodmobile for the music for this episode and all of our episodes you can find a link to his music on our website and also be like to thank you for listening to us and for so many of you who suggested Lyme disease and also for being patient has this is our final episode of this season but we will be back in just a few short weeks so thank you so much for allowing us to make two whole seasons of this podcast and listening to it and then a third one in the meantime yeah okay with that wash your hands you filthy beautiful animals and check yourself for ticks do it take a check the phone line and envy
