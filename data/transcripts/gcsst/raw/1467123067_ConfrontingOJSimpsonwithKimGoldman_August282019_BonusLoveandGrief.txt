in the last episode of confronting OJ Simpson I talked with grief counselor and author David fessler if you've ever lost someone close to you his words will speak to your heart what do you think of the phrase I'm first one to do it but like I'm sorry for your loss do you people that reject that I do and sorry for your loss as it comes across a number of different ways for some people it feels like pity for other people they'll go away what are you sorry about you didn't do anything the thing I hear most the people wish is they wish for stories about their loved one who died especially stories that they didn't know someone's got a story that you've never heard about your loved one and I also think pictures that you've never seen as you know when a loved one dies it feels like there is no more of that you're not going to discover more but if someone is o y remember something they did oh it's more that's a beautiful thing to get people do you have a lot of people that you talk to that seek out mediums and absolutely I've seen mediums who have taken people's life savings and I've seen really talented mediums and one of the questions I always get from therapist should people in grief go to mediums and I'm like first of all it's never my place to tell anyone in grief what they should or shouldn't do people in grief go to mediums what do you think people are looking for people want the connection early on they have lost that connection and they want to go to it and a medium sometimes will give them the connection they're seeking and give them to your loved ones okay later they come back to their grief even if my loved one tells me they're okay even if they're in heaven or the afterlife I still missed him at the dining room table I still don't get there and then they feel the grief that I bought you a couple and their Vincent very consistent messages and I've been very very particular because our stuff has been so public that like you could tell you could say that you could have just done your research before I came in here and and so I never get my name but there have been some consistent messages that have been very upset that each of them has said that my brother has said basically it's not your job anymore it's not your responsibility and the way I interpreted that was said you don't have to keep fighting for me like it's it's okay to me like it's okay I know if I'm open to believing that my brother was communicating it's the protector in him that's wanting me to be okay well at the end of the day I don't think when our loved ones die we stopped loving them and I don't believe they stopped loving us ladies what an amazing time we live in our face and unlock our phone apps let us order pizza from yoga class we can have conversations with our watch I mean everything is just so super easy one thing that stays the same coloring our hair options salon and spend lots of time and money or grab one of his box kits at the drugstore and you never know what you're going to get but now there's any way Madison Reed I took a strong woman to shake up the hair coloring world and Amy errett did just that with Madison Reed the company she named after her daughter but if you're thinking okay how do I match my hair color don't worry Madison Reed gives you the tools you need so you can color with conference get ammonia-free multi tone hair color delivered to your door for less than twenty-five bucks visit Madison -

She said it's too hard for me to keep so I took the shirt and I quickly sealed it up just to save any smell real quick apple and grief grief to all the time and I encouraged him to do that but it's a comment I would see the shirt and I was always getting upset and then at my retreat someone wear the shirt and it was challenging for me and then my next class someone wore the shirt the shirt is now at every Retreat I do oh my gosh but it's just amazing to me that idea of like is it a common shirt or is he still with me in a relaxer I think we want to find meaning whether it's to honor that person under their life honor how they touched us change how they died for others whatever it may be so I think the question of seeing being in touch with someone is really a very personal question for you about whether that would bring you any meaning
