This is Led some people to believe that sunscreen may actually be contributing to the problem well what the scientist hash all this out but one thing the research is pretty clear on is that your diet can help prevent skin cancer and that is for sure a diet that includes a lot of fruits and vegetables fish herbs that seems to have a very protective effect against melanoma and we know this because in regions of the world where people eat this way the rate of skin cancer is substantially lower here in the United States and that is something you should know my first guess today is about to make your life so much easier he is David you probably seen him around he's been profiled on 60 Minutes and 48 hours and he's a correspondent for CBS Sunday Morning Show and a host of science shows for PBS's Nova and that he's also written some books in and 1/4 Key Road is called Pogues Basics life and it is all these life hacks and tips that he has found and research and a nice things are great that mean they can really save you time and money and collect personal failure of mine I have no tolerance for steps I have no tolerance for you to patiently designed mechanism so my entire life I'm looking for shorter more efficient ways to do things so they come from my brain they came from my followers on Twitter they came from everybody I spoke to for a year telling him I was working on this book and almost everybody's got one or two of their own so that it's an amalgamation so since there's so many let's just have you dive in first of all with some of your favorites minor putting some feature it's really cool but the word just never got out so the classic case is the American highway sign those green highway sign there's a big sign that says no Poughkeepsie miles above that is a small sign that has the exit number Exit 23 the side of the big sign that the small sign appears on tells you which side of the highway the engine will be on so it says Exit 23 on the left of the big sign that's the side of the highway to be in when you exit and it's always been there but you never communicated that to us but most exits are on the right anyway so you know it's only the occasional one that's on the left side write and in a similar example is in the car maybe about half of everybody knows this one on your fuel gauge where it says ETF is a tiny picture of a gas pump with an arrow pointing either to the left to the right and that Arrow tells you which side of the car your gas tank is on and you probably know which side you're your own car's gas tank is on but if you're in a rental or a borrowed car tells you which way to pull into the gas station so pick one or describe has impacted you the most you found really fascinating this is the one that changed my life the most someday most of us will be over 40 and start to need reading glasses or contacts turns out if you're caught without them can't find them you don't have them in or you're in the shower or something you can use the pinhole camera effect you take your hand and curl your index finger very tightly until there's just a pinhole left hold it up to your eye and look through and Incredibly you can suddenly read again without glasses so it's great for menus and restaurants or the little bottles in the shower and hotel if it works by as a photographer would say decreasing the aperture so that it keeps everything in Focus it's it's quite amazing talk about getting the last of the ketchup out of the bottle my mom suggested this one people trying to get this the last ketchup out of the bottle will pound on it I'll bang it but there's a much easier more efficient way hold bottle from the bottom and swing it around your body like centrifugal force and amazingly that forces of catch up instantly down into the neck of the bottle where you can open the cap and poured out it works with mustard and children's toothpaste and all kinds of jelly substances so how many times have people been printing out some important thing in the printer cartridge runs out of ink and you have a way to save it cartridges by blow-drying them take him out heat it up with a blow dryer and put the cartridge back into the printer you'll get another 5% or so out of the infant was there so it'll it'll save that print job those about to end I've been trying my shoes all wrong it's turned out the way they taught us a tire shoes actually creates a granny knot it's it's a slip knot and that's why children's shoes come untied for example the first step of tying your shoes you're holding one lace in each hand and most people have the left lace in front of the right lane before they ducked under ins and tighten it Switched at Birth the right lace in front of the left lace as you do that first crossover and then proceed as usual the loop that not will not come undone until you want to undo it so you have a way to re-record a voicemail message but I thought it kind of depended on the system people had no it doesn't that mean many of the many of the commands determined determined by what you have Verizon AT&T or whatever but this one happens to work on all four of the American carriers so if you're leaving a message for somebody and you press the pound key doesn't matter what carrier the person uses a voice prompt gives you three options and number three press number 3 always give you the chance to delete the voicemail you just left and try it again so if you change your mind or if you pick up a more conservative wording would be better press pound and then three works for all the carriers why is renting a hotel room from my phone cheaper than my computer hotel rooms so is the day of the of the lodging approaches they make the price lower on smartphones than on computers because they're trying to appeal to business Travelers and Millennials and people who make last-minute Hotel Arrangements but it's quite amazing if you use an app or website on your smartphone you will save a ton of money for the identical hotel room using the identical booking service then if you use your laptop to your desktop there's a way to get in a customer service phone number for just about anybody right Google it like trying to find it just type U Burger King 800 number and you'll get it but I got a website to called what was it contact help ya contact help.com if they have a database of the world's companies email phone with the whole thing you know which one I found really interesting in the book was about butter have to refrigerate butter because it's a dairy product bad no I won't even the USDA website says it's okay to leave butter out of the refrigerator for many weeks and the advantage of that forces that is always soft and therefore more spreadable and the reason works is because bacteria can't grow in food without moisture without water and butter is almost entirely fat what water there is sealed into tiny volcel so it is true you do not need to refrigerate refrigerate butter and in Europe nobody does not like to think I'm up on these kind of things cuz I do all these interviews with people but that one I'd never heard I always thought you had to refrigerate butter down to in hope that they come back as anybody ever studied at to see if it really works or you're just kind of hoping it does your dog you you leave out things that smell like him if you put out the blanket the toy some water and then by the way a note to let other people know not to disturb that stuff in many cases the dog will come back to you that's Joe veterinary science at work and the dog comes back in many cases I mean you're much better off doing that than not doing that well you're right it is what could it hurt while you're trying other things get it out of the park for me in and we're done I'm going to live when you're picking up somebody at the airport pick them up at the departures level even know they're arriving beat them at departures and the reason is they don't have Security Guys Chasing Cars away at the departures level cuz most people just arrived drop off and leave nobody hanging out so you'll have the opportunity to sit there and your car at the curb not be chased away and greet the person coming out of work you know most much better if they don't have luggage but even if they do it sometimes better for them to go up a level so that you can wait for them but you have some things in the back of the book about some things that don't work that people think work is wishful thinking land and people send these things around like crazy though they're called life hacks and they're most of them don't work some of them are just silly like if you're ever caught out in the woods camping without kindling you can like Doritos as kindling well when they have Doritos but not wood or a great example is you can make a piece of leftover pizza crisp Again by microwaving it next to a cup of water it's like no it doesn't work at all yet you're just going to make it in which year that way so every one of these books tips in the book has been tested and certified I like this one cuz I've always thought it was true as you tap on the top of a soda can and if it's been shaken in that will prevent it from spewing when you open it if you're waiting longer you're taking time with the tapping for the bubbles to settle down but it it does not in fact make any difference with You tabs again and not time is the only thing that that is correct great thanks David it's always good to have you on you you have you have so much stuff that just makes my life complete makes me smarter and I appreciate it thank you David Pogue is the author of the book Pogues Basics life and he is podcast episode at something you should know. Net is discussing politics or or really any controversial topic gotten so nasty and what can we do about it plus if you like Japanese food but you know about Wasabi but what is it exactly where does it come from and why very often is the Wasabi you get fake all that's coming up on something you should know Capital One is building a better bank one that feels nothing like a typical bank it's why they reimagined Banking and build something completely different Capital One cafes they offer checking accounts with no fees or minimums and savings accounts with one of the best savings rates in America this is banking reimagined with your needs in mind open an account today at any Capital One location or online in 5 minutes and experience banking reimagined for yourself Capital One what's in your wallet Capital One na member FDIC it seems to have gotten to the point today we're talking politics can be dangerous I mean if you watch politicians on television or really anybody who's talking or are debating a controversial issue gun control abortion in topic it's so quickly deteriorates into agree to disagree just isn't what it used to be so what's going on here why is the goal now to Surly to discuss the topic but to demonize the other side to take a look at is James Hogan he is public relations executive for many years and he has a book which is titled and you're an idiot Which Wich to change Hawaii have things deteriorated to this level why every time it seems too controversial topics or politics E King St I want to know things I've noticed I've been in the public relations business for 25 years and I used to be in the persuasion business now people in my business are in the polarizing business and our job is basically to take even science or evidence and Infuse a kind of partisan meaning into it so that it's not something that my team believes and if you do believe it then you must be part of their team yeah so what we're why did it change when did it change I think it's more effective and I think it's the one of things Noam Chomsky said to me was you know what you can't win an argument shriek call people names do anything to not to avoid having to try to make an argument so that and that's what people are doing some of these issues are impossible and so in order to kind of prevail whether it's in politics or in business or in policy you need to resort to this kind of Highly polarizing methodology and yes most of us would think that I would think that that that didn't work because you know if people treat me like I'm an idiot I'm not going to cooperate so it works for the status quo with your fighting change say you're in the oil business it works it works for you too to confuse things to such a level that nothing happens know what people just throw their hands up and walk away play Pink we we give the hold of the role of Reason too much credit in democracy I mean ad hominem attacks have been around since democracy began but now they with the growth of social science maybe a hundred years of it right there is it's become much more sophisticated and so really what's happening is you don't have to get involved in the actual argument you just have to make the case that that that other person is kind of not worthy of Any of of of even participating in the good paid you you know call the name I think people like people like to think that I can see through that that I'm I'm smart enough to be able to to see that for what it is and what's really important to me are the issues at hand right big mistake we tend to look for people who think like us and before we decide what to believe and so it's very easy for people like us who have belonged to our tribe to manipulate us and that is the way this works so what are you suggesting are you suggesting we be more civil or are you suggesting we take we take advantage of this new snippy nasty tone and use it to our advantage the first step is zooming that people who disagree with you don't have bad intentions and they aren't the end if they're not idiots and being open to their views and I think that kind of a process can it's not always going to work it's not like Silver Bullet but it can start a different kind of conversation with people start to listen more to each other cuz it's the listening that's missing so can you give me an example to kind of fill in the blanks here of how that explain what you mean example would be climate change when you look at how polarized it is it's kind of like a fight between good and evil and I think the fact of the matter is people who run oil companies are not evil even though we need to do something about climate change they have a lot to say and so you can have a conversation about that and I have had those conversations even though my mom a climate-change Advocate it doing cuz I think we need to do something about it that's a very serious problem that said just because someone doesn't agree with me doesn't mean adaptive are in a wrongdoer or they're sort of evil and that they should be like a David and Goliath battle the fact is if you don't be kind of issues are so big and so difficult if you don't get people who are on the other side of the issue to work with you to move towards a solution even when you have to compromise their won't be Solutions and so that's a very good example I can oil companies and environmental advocates does fish supply do you think he just didn't day-to-day life that did the way we just deal with people in our lives as saying the same rules apply it's funny because that's not what I was writing a book about I was writing the book about the Public Square in this idea that just like you can pollute a natural environment you can pollute the Public Square with this kind of unyielding one-sidedness but over and over again people have come up to me and said y'all this exactly what I just broke up with someone so and then they tell his story that it's you know it might as well be magnified into a political debate is very similar types of skills that are used and we tend to be we don't tend to be good listeners certainly that's my is it in my case it's something I have to work at and I think there's a lot of people like me and we we cannot to We tend to sort of jump to defending our side route to quickly rather than kind of looking for, now that mean there are people who are who are gifted or not like that but a lot of us are and you know I think people tend to respond better when you ignore H that they may have a point and that you keep in mind that it's not just very who could be in under unknowingly under the influence of bias but you could have that problem as well I'm speaking with James Hogan his book is called I'm right and you're an idiot get to Old Navy now all of your favorite jeans have just been redesigned and are now a whole lot better better fabric benefits for a better booty they're all new super flattering fits are

disagreeing or agreeing to disagree they truly believe the other person is wrong there is no Common Ground abortion is a a good example of that there is no compromise an abortion it you either have it or you don't it did there's no middle ground some of those some of the issues are like that that's that's true. I think the thing that's different today is that this has become professionalized and people in my business in the public relations business are no longer really in the persuasion business there in the polarizing business and when you have these kinds of Highly polarized issues and that you never get to the point where they wear Solutions can be implemented or there's a discussion about how you fix it it's always just these kinds of butting heads and it doesn't move forward so there are some issues that I agree with you that are like that they're win-lose but there a lot of other issues where you could find Common Ground I mean no one can convince me that a Republican or a conservative in my country Canada isn't just as concerned about clean water and clean air as I am but that but they're often painted that way that's right and if it it do you know the the bias is on both sides we all think we're right attitude like I'm right you're wrong let me tell you what you should think that is not a good communication strategy I can tell you after 30 years of being a public relations business it doesn't work well it depends on what work means to you I mean depends on what the goal is I guess I think that don't you think that gold has changed its not so much to come to an agreement or find common ground it's to demonize the other side that's right that's exactly my point but that leaves you you know one of Carol tavris was one of the people I interviewed for my book and she said you know what you hear the Ruckus outside your house you know you open the windows to see what's going on but if it there's a Ruckus every night you should have closed the shutters and kind of batten down the hatches and try to ignore it and that is a very dangerous thing when you have the kinds of problems they're stalking us to Dave problems with terrorism and immigration problems financial problems that are causing so much concern around the world that the the inequity in income the climate change problems these are problems that you and your friend that you have dinner with who all agree are not going to solve on their own we need to figure out ways to do to be able to work with people who disagree with us in this is not it's not like there's no historical example of that this happened lots of times throughout history with the right and the left took have stood together Second World War first world war in the United States who was Republicans who who founded the EPA who set up the national park system now there's there's plenty of times that people have you know I have a friend who used to be an MP in Canada and he was like a very left-of-center guy the first time I went to Parliament was with him and we're walking through the halls of parliament he needs those big predaceous guy hugging everybody in nearly all the people he was hugging we're like way on the other side of the floor ultra-conservatives in the Mulroney government like Finance ministers but there was a it was a collegiality even though there was differences there was an ability to be able to you know what to talk and work things out and that whatever degree is possible Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill we're off and you know what they were on opposite sides of the political Spectrum that's why I think we need for me I I understand why we have to polarized and and I think that it's you know advocacy on a whole range of issues have made the world a better place you know thank God for Martin Luther King and for many other Advocates but we need to also be good at finding common ground because it's not you can't have one without the other or you end up in this kind of Perpetual everything just becomes more and more unreasonable and more and more polarized and nothing happens and there are some problems that you can't just leave that way well it is interesting what you said in the beginning that vid it's it's gotten this way cuz it's more effective you know it's it's easier to to get people's attention I guess when you scream and yell as opposed to try to gently persuade or if you're trying to stop change so if you're if you're trying to ask if you don't want a solution if you if you if the status quo is fine and for a lot of people that status quo is fantastic so strategies a really good strategy but ultimately for for democracy and for the Public Square this you need a process where there is a 2in pro I mean that's the whole idea you know dirt democracies work the Public Square is healthy if there's a reasonableness there and reasonableness in the sense of inclusiveness and I in the sense of being able to not just express your side of the story but listen to somebody else's yeah well like you say that seems to be what's missing when people think they're right they don't see a need to listen to the other side of the story because that person doesn't know what they're talking about this is just as much of a problem on the right there on the left it is on the right you know what you mean ization there's just as many people who are kind have crazy ideas about immunization is there are about people who have crazy ideas about climate change so finally went so what's knowing what you know and having looked at this so what's the advice what's the ABC here that really kind of stuck with me and I spoke about 70 people and I spent an afternoon with someone named tick not Han who is a Vietnamese Buddhist monk and who's famous on environmental work that he does and I was asking him about environmental advocacy and I'm saying because he was saying we should we should meditate me to bring meditation into the people, calm people down so I said you're not saying people shouldn't be Advocates or you and he looked at me and he said speak the truth but not to punish and I think that there's a huge amount of wisdom in that this idea that we need to bring a bit of warm heartedness into the debate and not be so convinced that the other side is feeling tension door or an idiot on the issue but that we could be more open to their views and an N realize that there may in fact not be that much of a difference you know it would probably agree on 80% and being able to kind of move to the 80% sometimes is a helpful way to start to deal with that the tougher 20% well I'm not terribly optimistic that things are going to change but it certainly would be nice if we could get back to the agree to disagree idea and not have to resort to calling people names and screaming and yelling cuz it it just doesn't seem to accomplish anything good inside Jim thanks for your time thank you so much and you're an idiot and there's a link to his book on the show notes page for this podcast so you know when you order sushi at a restaurant that usually comes with nose usually get some sliced Ginger and you get wasabi that green paste that's pretty spicy so what it's a pretty interesting question but Wasabi plant itself grows naturally in the Benz and rivers in Japan Taiwan Korea and New Zealand and wasabi is almost impossible to grow naturally so almost all the Wasabi is basically grown in the wild not real Wasabi until it's graded from the root is not spicy but what is graded in a circular motion it forms a paste and releases these hot Vapors loses its strength after about 15 to 20 minutes so it has to be served immediately after it's turned into a paste and real Wasabi is expensive like $100 a pound expensive that's why there was Sabi that we consume in the United States is an impostor it's a blend of horseradish powder and mustard Witcher 2 similar roots that are far far cheaper that you can tell the difference because actual Wasabi is as a smoother taste than the horseradish mustard stuff that we commonly consumed here and instead of creating a sensation on the tongue and in the mouth real Wasabi you sent more in your nose and your nasal passages and that is something you should know and that is the podcast today I Mike Carruthers thanks for listening to something you should know
