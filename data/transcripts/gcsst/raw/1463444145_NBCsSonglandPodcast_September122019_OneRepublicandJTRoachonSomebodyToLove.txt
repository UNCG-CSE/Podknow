hi I'm Audrey Morrissey and I and one of the co-creators of someone land you heard me for the first time last week because I stepped in for Dave Stewart to unfortunately it was in the Bahamas for this devastating storm our hearts go out to everybody in the Bahamas and Dave and his family if you would like to send money for the relief effort you can go to the American Red Cross phone number is one 800-435-7669 but tonight it is the finale of season 1 of song land with OneRepublic and Ryan Tedder as the frontman of the band has left his chair as a resident producer writer and has moved over to the the guest artist and what's fascinating about this is it's the first time that One Republic has taken a song from an outside writerand further for winning songwriter JC roach it's incredibly fitting studied songwriting by studying Ryan Tedder before we hear from JT let's hear from Ryan and OneRepublic guitar player Zach filkins I wanted to be a part of this because because it is kind of breaking boundaries especially for us so because you know once I heard that we were doing an episode it really made sense to tit to kind of break the boundary that that we have as a band which is really kind of a shutdown like we're only doing songs in house like we're not going to we're not going to break that Rule and why not I mean we started off with a huge rule brake you know so why not try it out and and see what can happen from it three four years ago the idea of the show got brought to my attention by one of the producers from the voice that I'd known Adam Levine I had a long conversation with him talking about TV and complaining about how much travel I do promoting songs you travel around the world non-stop any kind of put the bug in my ear that time I said you know you if you ever wanted to do TV I think you'd be good at it and Define the right shower the right thing involving music and also cuts down a lot on having to cover hot in promoting so selfishly I was like oh my God if I can do television if I'm doing something that's often take to who I am talking about music every single day and writing songs then it was just a natural like assortment of things that I like to do and I'm really bad at doing things that art van or don't interest me I'm a horrible Faker and I lose interest like that fast so for me this is been incredible and blessing because it is really just what I do on a daily basis just put the camera this is like a really cool experiment we've never taken an outside song as far as the writing communities concerned they know that we don't take outside songs so for us this is just a new I mean we've been together 12 years now this is like why not like we don't have nothing to protect your hide like we're not being precious at this point so we're riding for new album the timing couldn't be better it just kind of made sense all of it made so I wouldn't be doing this if if we weren't making an album and it didn't line up with what we are doing but it works for where we're at right now and being a producer panel versus being in the chair is completely different although I would say my reaction to the songs is the same pretty much as how I'd react if I was on the producer panel I think maybe I leaned back a little bit more than I normally would ignore them chomping at the bit like with here's the idea and here's what we should do I really wanted Esther and Jason and Shane to get their ideas across first but other than that it felt similar the only difference is I don't have to go back to my studio in scramble to finish the song right now I got three people doing the work for me so that's why I can't answer what kind of song OneRepublic is looking for ever I've never been able to answer that every option has come out of a need to say something I need to get this off my chest I know what I want to say burst of energy person ideas burst of thought it's never over thought our best songs are not over thought for arduous and furthermore I never know what the next One Republic single or head or album is going to sound like until I hear it there's nothing worked the hardest part about being this man is with so many other bands where they clearly know this is our narrative this is our style that we're doing this is what we do we never have that I'm not chasing one specific I'm not constantly trying to be the new version of the police or the new version of this generation film blank and what makes it worse for us is I am abhorrent lie against putting out a hit song just for the sake of having a hit and that sounds so defeating and I would say it almost sounds fake self-deprecating or something it but there's a lot of hit records that have come across my path in riding with four other artists and crafting stuff for the Artisan last 2 years prison songs I could have featured on as a singer of this band that we haven't jumped on because the moment we put out a record it's a hit for the sake of having a hit like that feeling such a Sinking Feeling to me and I know a lot of artists do it and part of the game is having hits but for me putting a song out just because I know it's a Hittites like I can see myself in a car somewhere calling bowlshit on myself and I can't deal with that and I wish I wish I could turn that ship off sometimes he's going to go that doesn't record unless I have to have such a very specific profound feeling for me to believe in One Republic single enough to be like I think is it let's go and it only comes around every like a couple times every few years sadly but I'm in that frame of mine now so I'm ready I don't know what One Republic is ever looking for I only know it when I hear it my name is JT roach I'm from Madison Wisconsin I've been based in Los Angeles for The Last 5 Years I wrote Somebody to Love the song that one the one Republic episode of song Lynn my family definitely raised me with a love of music you know a lot of car rides my dad is blasting Beatles music and I grew up Catholic so I'm a lot of music in church by the time I got into college I was kind of guy who would do YouTube covers of like my favorite Drake and Miguel songs and I remember a song I did getting like 50,000 views in like a few days I was like oh so like okay people will listen to this if I had put some time into it I would say the real incubation. Of when I committed fully to writing songs was in the first two years that I was living in LA and that was all I was doing and everything was for the goal of being a professional songwriter and making a living off of Minecraft the first 6 months I live in Sherman Oaks ran out of money and my friends let me crash on the couch in Silverlake and what I did was I stayed in that house for 2 years slept on a twin mattress and their hallway and wrote demos out of one of the closets in the house probably about 300-400 Demos in a couple years Somebody to Love I did in a session with one co-writer into producers Andrew Wells was one of the co-producers the other co-producers a guy named jinte and my co-writer who is more top-line oriented lyric Melody oriented guy named Kevin Fisher and Andrew started on the guitar he's amazing guitarist started vibing on the courts and we were like all of that feels like a goodbye for today that feels like the mood that were in and we just kind of fell from that so if the whole song was built out of the guitar shapes where you really only plucking to notes of a chord in these four beautiful chords happened jumping off point for us to start the song in this case the vibe was just really strong right away he and Jen started building the beat you know it's a strong buy when you automatically start getting Melodies lyric ideas and everybody gets excited in the room cuz you can feel the emotion from the song Kevin and I started fighting on the melody for the chorus I knew that we needed really percussive lyric at the end of that because that Cadence is super fast so we tried several different concepts in the one that we kept coming back to that felt like the entire move the song Somebody to Love Somebody as soon as we heard somebody to love with that Melody choose automatic hook we start with that chorus and it's a really quick and it went back in the booth and I sang the descending falsetto Miley my co-writer had just gone through a break-up you know talking to him about that jogs up all my memories for breakups that iPad we talked about how much he was afraid to see her out and I know I've been in that situation where I went out and I saw an ex-girlfriend and you know you kind of play through that your head was going to happen when you see them and I remember walking past my ex girlfriend and she just walked straight past me and acted like she didn't even see me in like how much that sucked you know it's just a really heavy moment the first original lyrics were you say it doesn't feel the same I know who to blame I'm the one to blame I know how you got away I let you get away let you get away it doesn't feel the same I know how you got to let it go at that moment I felt like it was my fault for letting that girl get away Section 8 beating yourself up about it why did I let this person out of my life I should like fought for them and now it's clear that this person has moved on and just how difficult it is to confront that when you're not over somebody and this was the song that got me onto the show NBC songland on the OneRepublic episode I did know about Ryan Shannon Esther before the show and Jason evigan as well he was the gas producer on our episode you're all amazing Shane you know they called the Wordsmith cuz he's just so insane with lyrics Asters like smelly isn't Cadence's in like style is incredible and then Jason is obviously an incredible producer and writer he's got hot record right now with girls like you by Maroon 5 and Good Things Fall Apart with Jon Bellion and illenium so I've definitely study their work Ryan in particular I remember when I first moved out to Los Angeles and living in that hallway and working out of closet I pulled up the song Counting Stars by OneRepublic and I brought it into a logic session and I chopped it all up and colorized every single section and learned why certain things happen in certain sexually why we skip the kicks here while you put the snares in there why does he do this walk around here remember asking all those questions and that's how you learn from the best it's so crazy to me that I went through that and then end up on the show on his episode it's very dreamlike to walk through the door into just see this massive production set and then four of these people who you know you imagine the moment and then you're in it and it just feels very very surreal there was definitely some additional height to this episode because Ryan is usually a super producer / kind of judge on the show and on this one he's the actual artist I felt like he was going to be even harder and even harsher it with his criticisms I remember being very nervous for sure I kept trying to use the word excited so that I could do what I had to do you say it doesn't feel the same I don't know who to blame I'm the one to blame dang that is powerful man the First Reactions were that they love the chorus that was an anchor the whole song to me so I was so thrilled that they love the course because even before I performed it that like what's your favorite part of the song and I like it's the chorus and I think the bar got set kind of high by me saying that so I can I help my courses as good as I think it is so I was really glad that they like that and then the verse I know that they pretty unanimously wanted it to be stronger lyrically and just the Cadence wise they were all kind of loss of it but they're like Kenichi what's going on with this farce it's a little it's kind of like an Urban Flow but it's also not clearly defined what's going on these lyrics are two general they're not pulling us into the story because it's very clear you're not giving us details that pull us into this setting I know Shane was very adamant about that you know he's a top Rider Nashville and they're so good at pulling people and stories in versus I thought they were going to tell me at the end of the first round so I thought I was going to find out in that moment so they're like all you're going to find out right when you walk in the room and I was like oh I got to find out in that moment I got to mentally prepare for whoever is going to be in that room I was thrilled that it was Shane because I knew in that moment that he was going to help me get these verses where they needed to be because he's such a Lyricist so I was really stuck doing this fine the door I feel like Shane really push me to talk about what the story was actually about in to make it personal to me so Shane basically asked me like what moment are you in when you're thinking of this song to me this is about when I saw my ex girlfriend when I was out of the bar and she walked right past me and didn't say anything to me to hurt me you know and how much that sucked and that's really what the song is to me is a brutal moment he wanted to dig into how to tell the story in the versus into how to say specific things that brought people into the story because the original Verse lyrics were to General and they were bringing people into the story lyrically I think it could be home then we talked about the true story of the song so the New Verse lyrics never could imagine the way the story happened you with someone new used to be your focus now you don't even notice when I leave the room so it's me I was like how painful it is that the person doesn't even care that you're in the room anymore the new pre-chorus was really what sealed it with you not even trying to make me jealous but you can't help it I was like this is the moment when the person is so over you that they don't even care how you react and how brutal it can be when you want them to get upset when you see them and you want them to be upset that they're running into you or whatever it is but they're actually legitimately over you and how much more that sucks and I'm getting worked up and showing that they care Ryan also had some input on the lyrics and what he wanted I know he wanted the angle to be something that he could relate to personally and he went through something recently with his family where one person moved on from another person and he could really relate to the song in that way so we really tried to craft and create it into a story for him that when he sings it live he can really feel it and relate to it so the second performance I was really just focused on performing it directly honestly and I originally was going to do it on guitar and sing but I was having trouble connecting to it emotionally because I was trying to perform it correctly we had changed the lyrics so much so I felt like I was trying to get it right as opposed to trying to connect with it and I remember Shane being like if we're going to do this right you need to connect with emotionally so we ditched the guitar and they brought in a cello player and I came out and just tried to focus on singing it and try to put myself in that moment I figured if I could really connect with the infield a song than everybody else would never could imagine play the story app Focus no you don't even notice when I leave the room plenty of trying to make me jealous what song is so good it's so good the second time the reactions were amazing I remember Ryan saying that this felt like a song that is always existed we really leaned into the emotion the song and accentuated it and I feel like it paid off by having these new verses in this new pre chorus lyric because it made the chorus feel that much heavier I tried to just focus on doing the best that I could in my performances that's all you can really control I just tried to for my heart into the songs and do everything the best that I could and let the chips fall where they may so the song that knock me off my feet I had one circling around my head over and over again and it kills me to make somebody feel my heart beating out of my chest and I feel like Ryan was definitely messing with us in like dragging the moment out cuz he knew we were nervous I'm at my heart skipped a beat and I think I tear it up and just like the kind of cover my face but just incredible moment once-in-a-lifetime thing it was all very very surreal really honestly it's just such an honor to be a part of the show and it was such a blast like how many people can say that they did something like this in their lives so I had so much fun and I'm obviously honored that I wanted that he chose my song on that One Republic Joe's West Nile still hard to believe that happened Somebody to Love we take because it feels timeless it is painful it is a runner it is simple and it's all out front it's not too heavy the melody reminds me of something I hear the police or sting doing back in the day as well which I love and it suits my vocal range perfectly it is a magical song it is my honor to introduce onerepublic's new single Somebody to Love written by JT roach Shane mcanally Andrew Jin taeko Kevin Fisher and Ryan Tedder Play the song Rehab used to be in focus you don't even know when I leave the room Shana movie Judds that you can have show me how to say the locals easy 7 victims easy and I see it on your face I don't want you to do and even trying to make him Miss make you miss me. I don't know what he's doing somebody to anime BJ show me you're so beautiful you don't even know one of these thanks for joining us for this final season one song Land podcast again if you would like to donate to the Bahama disaster relief please go to the American Red Cross phone number 800-435-7669
