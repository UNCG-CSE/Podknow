man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly now he goes on to say it doesn't belong to the critic anybody can sit in the cheap seats and take your inventory and criticize you and I promise there are people in your life who do that maybe it's your mother-in-law maybe it's your dad maybe it's your sister your wife your husband is probably somebody in your life who's really happy to sit back and take your inventory and tell you how you do things wrong in your life those are the people that you need to put on the outbound train to somewhere way away from where you are cuz they don't help what I want to talk to you about today is what you can do to maximize your position in life and I don't care whether you're 18 2048 5070 it makes no difference to me if you're in the game you want to do as well as you can do and here's what I want you to know right now you have a Playbook everybody has a Playbook the NFL just started this last weekend so everybody's walking around learning their playbook for the season they've all got plays the offense have plays the defense has played they got a Playbook they told hold on that Playbook and they lose that Playbook it's their ass believe you me play books are important and you've got one where the you realize it or not you have a Playbook you have a way of being in this world you have an attitude of approach you have standards what you're willing to accept from yourself what you're not willing to accept from yourself but you have a Playbook and you run it every day you get up and you run your place you got certain place you run it might be how you approach your job it might be how you approach your relationships it might be how you approach your feelings about yourself it might be how you approach your goals but you have a Playbook but I'll bet if I said okay get out of pen get out of pad hit pause on this podcast and start writing down your plays I bet it wouldn't be long before you hit play again because we don't ever think about that and I'm going to tell you why there is a real hole in our system we go to school and they teach us how to read and write and add and subtract they teach us about geology and biology they teach us all kinds of subject matters but they don't teach us how to live they don't teach you how to deal with stress they don't teach how to deal with depression if it comes they don't teach you how to handle it when you lose a loved one somebody you care about dies they don't teach you how to negotiate they don't teach you how to interview they don't teach you how to get what you want I went to Public Schools all the way through but they never taught me about goal-setting they never taught me any of that so then we go out there to World in okay maybe we learn how to do algebra or geometry but nobody told us how to manage Our Lives they didn't teach us any of those things that's why I think there's a big void and that's why living by Design number 5 is so critical and if you haven't listened to the first for I suggest you do you don't need to necessarily listen to before you listen to number five but this one is designed to give you a Playbook you say when we were you just told me I had to play but yeah I did but you don't know what it is and I want you to have a Playbook that you learn and that you are familiar with that what if by us having these conversations you can learn some strategies you can learn some behaviors you can learn some steps that substantially change your life what am I listening to these conversations that we're having here you can pick up one or two things every time you listen to this that changed the way you interact with the world and it impacts your station in life it causes you to have more money cause you to have more happiness it causes you to have more peace it causes you to have a closer walk with God it causes you to have whatever it is that you value in this life would you not want that for God's sakes it's free I'm sitting here telling you you can have a better life however you define better life if you will just be who you are and reach for what you want and do it on purpose what if there are things that you can learn that change the outcome of your life now think about it we're here right now in September the rest of this year's going to go by whether you're doing something about improving your life or whether you're not September's going to slide by October's going to slide by you going to be getting Halloween candy then it's going to be Thanksgiving there's going to be time for Christmas then you're going to be sitting there making these idiotic New Year's resolutions like we do every year that X going to go by whether you're doing something about your life or whether you're not I'm just saying let's do something about it don't let this fall Slide by like all the rest of them let's use these four months so you gain momentum knowledge know how so when you make New Year's resolutions this January they're real here's the first thing I want you to know I wrote a book back in 1998 I talked about this in one of the living by designs before but I wrote a book that had the 10 laws of life in it my phone number one was you either get it or you don't one of the earlier chapters I talked about how I came about that life you listen to that if you want to but think about what I just said you either get it or you don't the question you should be asking yourself is what is it you either get it or you don't so you should be ask yourself what's it what's the it you want me to get the it's different for everybody will talk about that as we go along but let's just use a generic it right now don't you know people that are just out to lunch me whatever it is you're doing they just don't get it I mean maybe you're going on a retreat at your job and there's one person that's just always kind of out of sync did you just don't get it whatever it is you doing maybe it's team building or something that they just don't get it maybe you're going to have people over for dinner and there's one guy that's just kind of stand over by MC just doesn't get it he just doesn't get that this is just a time to socialize maybe you've got somebody there from work and they just won't talk about work all the time they don't get it wait a minute this is not work time or you've got people that are at work and all they want to do is talk about the weekend in football they don't get to know this is work done there people that just don't get it and it doesn't have to do with intelligence it has to do with tuning in and reading the room reading your life figuring out what's going on with you and what you want looking around and asking yourself is everybody in my life path Play Me by did I think I was going to be way further along at this point in my life than I am if the answer to that is yes what is it I'm not getting what is it I'm kidding myself about here before I started doing dr. Phil and I'm not talking about myself in the third-person I'm talking about dr. Phil is entity on television dr. Phil is a platform where we deliver Common Sense usable information to people's homes everyday for free before I did that I had a trial science firm and we lived in trial lawyers will get a case and they may spend five years getting it ready and then right before trial it settles to the lawyer takes a big case to verdict 5 or 10 times in their entire career that's a lot because big cases don't come along that often and those that go all the play the verdict or probably not one in ten they all settle or they get thrown out on motions in some way the ones that actually make it all the way to Vertical are pretty rare but that's all we did we did those it made it all the way to Vertical when we trained witnesses to tell the truth effectively and we prepared to all the documents in the graphics and we chose the jury we worked out trial strategy we did everything and we had an extremely high rate of success we had a very high rate of predicting the outcome much higher than our rate of success but we could predict the outcome with extremely high success but we also had a real high rate of winning our cases and I'll tell you why we out prepare the other side we just how prepared we didn't necessarily have better lawyers we didn't necessarily have better facts we didn't necessarily have better clients we didn't necessarily have been computers we didn't necessarily have prettier Graphics or better Witnesses we just prepared the other side we knew their case is better than they knew it and we mocked ride these things time and time again and we would put on their case I would take our best lawyer and have him or her try the other side's case against the rest of our team and we found thing where it got to the time if we got to trial it was anti-climactic cuz they didn't put on near good a show as we did they didn't put on near as tough a case as we put on if we could defeat our version of their case the feeding their version of their case was a walk in the park we weren't afraid to look at the bad facts we did not live in denial and we are prepare the other side we had every fact every graphic every contingency dealt with and that took a lot of time to make a lot of money took a lot of effort but we out prepare the other side because I didn't want to be among those who didn't get it and I don't want you to be among those who don't get it which means you've got out prepare the rest of the world if you want to be the best at what you do if you want to be the most successful at what you do you just have to out prepare the other side you have to add Hustle the other people you have to at work the other people you have to out prepare the other people and if you're not willing to do that then you need to quit listening to this right now and turn on some music put your car on cruise and slide on home because winners do things losers don't want to do and if you want to be a winner you're going to have to do some things that you might not have been willing to do what it's not all about money it's whatever you decide success is going to be so the question is do you have everything in your life that you want and if you don't then you have to decide what area of your life there's something missing do you want more money and when I say what I'm getting ready to say I can already hear you rolling your eyes and yeah that's easy for you to say because you have it and I'm going to say money is the cheapest commodity I have so you say oh yeah it's easy for you to say cuz you have a lot of money well no it's not because I have a lot of money it said I can replace money I can't replace my health I can't replace my relationship with my two boys I can't replace my relationship with my wife I can't replace those things so they're not cheap Commodities if I run out of money I've learned across my life I can make more money that's why I say it's the cheapest commodity I have because it's the one thing I can replace if I get sick I can't necessarily replace my health but if I run out of money I can just go get another job I can go work harder I can live cheaper I can replace that so if it's more money you okay just decide you know what's the realistic Next Level the number one fear that people have in life is rejection you might say I was going to finish that sentence with failure to same thing if you fail then the world has rejected what you have to offer right let's say you open a business you open a bicycle shop and nobody buys your bicycles nobody brings her bicycle for you to get repaired what was then you've been rejected they don't want what you have to offer if I do a television show and nobody watches then they rejected me they said I don't care what you had to say I don't want to listen to you I don't want watch you. I don't care what you have to say I don't care then they rejected me and I failed you there's a lot of different words you can put in his place but what people have told me is the biggest fear they have is that they get out of their comfort zone which is where you are now even though it may feel uncomfortable and you reach for the next level maybe it's the next social run where you are in with a group of people you wish you were in with or maybe it's the next promotion where you get a better job or it's more money or a nicer house or a nicer car or maybe you want to be closer to your higher being that I called God and you just never make that connection you're so you reach for something and you don't get it that's what people tell me is their biggest fear is that they admit they want more than they have and then they don't get it they say that's their biggest fear you know what their second biggest. that they get it because then they have to keep it they get to a higher level now they got to stay there but that stuff if you want to do well you've got to take some risk and so I'm asking you do you have everything you want and if you don't then you need to make a list I mean actually write it down and don't is put on your computer you need to write it on a piece of paper and you need to carry it in your purse or your wallet or billfold or whatever you call what you carry stuff in so you can refer to it on a regular basis it can be your North Star your compass what is it you want more of that you don't have because I'm going to talk to you about the playbook for getting it before you can get it you need to know what it is what you want more of what you want different so let's talk about the playbook for success and we'll talk about the first thing in it I said you either get it or you don't that's just kind of an overarching backdrop to everything I'm going to tell you you need a tune in and decide you're going to be someone that is situationally aware you pay attention you read the room you see how people react to you all the things that have to do with reading how things are going that's just your backdrop that here's the first thing this is number one right this one down you must have a defined image and never ever break character we say that again you must have a defined image and never ever break character and what do I mean by breaking character let's say you have a defined image in your defined image is that you are a serious player you are somebody that can be counted on your reliable you are the go-to person and you want people to take you seriously respect your intellect respect your work ethic whatever if that's who you are and that's the image you want to project then you cannot go home on Saturday and get falling-down stumbling drunk and go on Facebook and do a bunch of stupid videos that make you look like a jackass and then go back to work Monday and expect everybody to take you serious in your image you do not break character self this character can have a broad change to the character that doesn't mean you're in work mode all the time this character has a social Channel this character has a romantic Channel this character has a career and work Channel this character has a spiritual Channel this character has a lot of different Lanes a lot of different categories but they have to be consistent you can't be a serious brain surgeon and a falling-down drunk and clown at the same time it's just in congruent so you have to decide what is the image that I want to project and this is not a phony Amy's I'm not saying role play for your image to work it has to be authentic you just have to decide what it is and then you have to commit to it and own it you can't be Middle Ground halfway one way and halfway another you cannot ride two horses with one ass you got to decide who you are and you go with that that's the horse you're going to ride all the way to the Finish Line therefore that's a very serious decision when you decide what is the image I'm going to project to the world what is it I'm going to put it out there that I want people to respond to because how you engage the world what kind of image you project to the world I believe strongly in the principle of reciprocity we get back from the universe what we put out to the universe if we are negative if we are pessimistic if we're just a Debbie Downer Donnie down there whatever we're just always looking for the worst and believe us there's a snake under every Rock and nothing is ever going to work then that's what you're going to get back from the universe if you like a duck if it doesn't rain you'll walk you just got to Bob along in the river is wherever it goes that's where you go then that's what you're going to get back from the universe they just say oh yeah he she they say they'll do whatever we give them in matter and I say well what about Bob over there and what about Karen over there a don't worry about them there whatever they're good with whatever well we're going to have to cut people salaries around here what are Bob and carry nothing but I they don't care they won't make any noise they'll do whatever very been a day in my life anybody's ever said what about feel that anybody should all he's good with whatever you don't even need to talk to him. One day in my life is anybody rational ever said that they've all said well we better go talk to him see what he thinks cuz he's very likely going to have an opinion about this one way or the other they just knew I have strong beliefs and one of the things that have been consistent with my images I hate people that find what's wrong with the situation and don't keep digging to come up with an alternative it's correct anybody can criticize anybody can say no when I was a courtroom Sciences we had very few rules that everybody follow the deal with clients and one of them was we'd never say no no was not in our vocabulary if you were a client that courtroom Sciences you never heard the word no come out of our apps that you might have something we couldn't do but you didn't hear us say know what you heard was let me tell you what we can do that where we doing what they wanted know it would have been impossible to do but that's not what we said our philosophy was say hey can we redo these four hundred charts on boards in the next hour or so I thought you idiot but that's not what we said we didn't say no we said let me tell you what we can do you can use 10 of those before the end of trial today will have those 10 done in 10 on standby and work on the others overnight we tell you what we can do people want to hear what you can do and one of my philosophies was tell him what you can do not what you can't do so you got to decide what your image is and the image has to be authentic this covers a lot of things it covers your physical presentation covers your verbal presentation it covers your value system it covers your philosophy of interacting with the world but not body shaming you here if you're out of shape I mean you're really out of shape your clothes don't look good on you whether you like it or whether you don't people will look at you and say that person doesn't take care of themselves their disheveled and that would be something that makes the hill you climb steeper if you use poor grammar it is a badge of ignorance that you say one Outlook we can all go to college grammar was in the fifth grade and if you use bad grammar then go to the library and check out a grammar book it's a 5th grade book if you say oh I seen him coming we was going to let me tell you that is a badge of ignorance it shows poorly on who you are at any level of interaction whether it's social or professional or whatever so you have to do an inventory and say what are things I can change how's your hygiene if you smell like a goat that's bad okay if you don't brush your teeth couple of times a day if you don't shower everyday if you don't wear clean clothes everyday if you don't groom yourself well then you're putting out an image that says I don't really care about myself so you have to make a decision to do the best you can with what you have I read an article one time that said 78% of men would rather amputate a body part than be bald well you ain't cut nothing off of me I'm bald look I work with what I got I made it a trademark there are very many people out here in Hollywood that look like me so I made it to trademark yum recognizable everybody looks like Johnny Depp nobody looks like dr. Phil so at least I'm distinctive so I'm saying decide an image and the image needs to be authentic to who you are and don't be pseudo-intellectual don't try to use words that you are comfortable with don't try to be somebody you're not that never ever works it has to be authentic to who you are but it needs to be the best version of you that you can be and once you decide who that is what that is in every category then you need to be the best version of that you can possibly be and don't break character ever you don't be the problem solver you don't be the person that is the go-to resource at work and then go out and get falling-down drunk with your co-workers after work you breaking character and they will lose respect for you you cannot Define yourself one way and then do a hundred and eighty degrees swing and expect to be successful in love business Society or anywhere else it just doesn't work that way and I don't know where you are in your life right now but if it's not working for you I've always said if you're in a hole stop digging if you've worked yourself into a hole with what you been doing you can improve your situation if you just stop digging I mean maybe you're rude maybe you're a jerk maybe just something about you that just grates on people you just get in a hole with people stop. going to hole if you got a hole in a boat you don't drain the water out of the boat by putting more holes in the boat to drain the water it doesn't work that way if something in your life is not working you've got to change it this episode is brought to you by invitae you do all the right things to protect your health you don't smoke you wear sunscreen eat healthy meals and see your doctor for checkups still you could be at an increased risk for cancer because sometimes it's genetic take the next step to understand what's in your jeans at invitae a genetic test that experts trust based on results you may be able to potentially lower your risk learn more by visiting and Vitae.

Phil when I say it to you right now dr. Phil just think about what that calls to mind now in that you're listening to this I hope it's something positive or maybe you TuneIn cuz you love to hate me that's okay cuz I don't have a need to be loved by strangers but when you think of dr. Phil I'll bet you don't confuse me with anybody else now there are other psychologist out the other shrinks out there the other mental health professionals out there but I bet you don't confuse me with any of them I'll guarantee you there are psychologists in America that have forgotten more psychology than I'll ever know but they forgot about learning how to communicate it I've got some Lil Mama Advisory Board cuz I'll call him up you'll be something really complex or whatever and I think okay I want to make sure I've got this right I want to make sure I've Got The Cutting Edge information of these men and women are the editors for the peer reviewed journals so I know they've got access to research that won't be published for another eighteen months so I don't give Cutting Edge information I give a head of cutting-edge information what research has shown that you can get from dr. Phil that you won't see in the journals for another year-and-a-half so I'm talking about OCD I've got up to the minute information because I talk to people that know more about it than I do there are some people that spend their entire career on that one disorder I don't but I know he does it so I'll bring those experts in now what I say you're not going to confuse me with anybody else there are people out there like John Gray John Gray Road Men Are from Mars and women are from Venus or whatever the title of it was I know John very nice guy lot of wisdom but you're not going to confuse the two of us cuz he's going to pass your hand and tell you it's going to be okay and why and he's very effective at what he does but we are very different we are very different you're not going to confuse me with him you're going to confuse him with me I believe in a defined product look you may think my Define product as I'm a barbarian you may think I'm the second coming of Common Sense and you're probably both a little bit right but you don't confuse me and that's what I want you to decide what is it about you that unique what is about you that set you apart from the rest of the herd and here's the thing think about your life is a movie that is a snapshot does the snapshot can be any day any moment anytime but we get Snapchat to you when you got the flu and think men this'll was look pretty rough there's no gal seen better days cuz we catch you at your worst time you just thrown your guts up and you feel like hell do you get a snapshot of you and could weigh underestimate you so you think your life is a movie not as a still frame and movies have scripts that have Beginnings they have they have ends and your life is that what your life is a process has a beginning and a middle and an end so let's talk about the script to your life where are you in it right now if you're listening to this it's not in the beginning I'm guessing you're not on the way to 7th grade unless your mom's driving and you're having to listen to this on the way and for that I apologize so you're probably at least in your twenties maybe your thirties or forties so you're into the movie talk about the script from here forward and here's the main thing I want to ask you are you starring in your own life are you the star in your life because if you don't star in your old life if you're not starring in your own life for god sakes who is I don't care if you are a plumber or butcher or a baker a Candlestick maker or a janitor or a car mechanic or an accountant the school teacher it doesn't matter what you do that's not who you are that's what you do you have to star in your own life and in every movie there's somebody in the lead right there somebody that's in the lead when they run the promos there's somebody in those promos and then there's a Supporting Cast and you have to start your own life so act like it by embracing your authentic self treat yourself like a star deal with yourself like you're a unique individual because I promise you when I meet people I think one thing they know themselves better than I do how do they feel about themselves then I figure I might know them a little bit or maybe a lot but I don't know them as well as they know themselves and if they treat themselves like crap I figured will they know something I don't they must not be worthy of being treated better because they know themselves better than I do so I have to defer they have a low self-image poor self-esteem who better than they to know what they deserve why would I question that so where are you in the movie of your life are you the store and are you embracing that image that authentic self how unique are you and let me say this if you don't feel unique then maybe it's time to reinvent yourself and you can do that without abandoning who you are because we all have a range of trade skills abilities and the capability to move within that range reinvention May mean changing everything from your look to what you do where you do it or the way you engage people it may mean changing your focus of the goals you seek to attain it may mean taking those drinks I was talking about and really building on those in one of the earlier living by designs I talked about putting things on project status not just having an awareness but putting things on project status is like you can be aware that the garage needs painting but it ain't going to get painted until you put it on project status until you say this weekend we're paying the damn garage that means no later than Thursday we're going by Home Depot or Walmart and we're going to get however much paint we need and we're going to get dropped Claws and brushes and rollers and what are all we need and we're going to have it there because when we get home Friday we're going to paint the damn garage just going to take a couple days so we go it dry and put on coats or whatever we're going to paint it that's our project this weekend so no we're not going to go play there's no we're not going to the movies no we're not going to the zoo we are painting the garage that's our project for this weekend that's when the garage will get painted not before that's when you will become unique and not before when you put it on project status that's when you will become unique that's when you will star in your own life and not before and like I say maybe that involves Reinventing yourself where in season 18 right now of dr. Phil if you can imagine that in every season when we wrap production everybody takes 2-3 weeks and they kind of decompress and go do other things but then we start meeting not intensive Lee at first but we start meeting with soul purpose of Reinventing ourselves for the next year what can we do to tell our stories better what can we do to get our message across better what do we need to attack that we haven't attacked full on before this summer for example we cannot avoid the fact that the opioid crisis has reached epidemic proportions and we are the sole platform that devotes all 60 Minutes of the hour to mental health we absolutely cannot delve into that how do we do that effectively how do we get people's attention how do we educate without seeming pedantic about it how do we deal with this in ways that we can motivate people for prevention and intervention that was one of the things that we talked about we're Reinventing how we're approaching those stories how we're dealing with this epidemic and it involves taking it beyond our platform Robin and I testified before a bipartisan committee on Capitol Hill about this last year we're going to do some more of that this year they've invited us back to talk about enabling legislation for this so we're Reinventing ourselves to be relevant to what's going on how about you what can you take on what do you need to do that's different if you do the same thing over and over and over then you get comfortable with it it may be producing some results for you but is it producing all the results you want let's talk about number three you must play Big not just long that this is a big one some people whether it's at work making a presentation a guest on television a date with somebody they want to form a relationship with they confuse quantity with quality shallow Brooks are noisy Still Waters Run Deep I've had so many experts on dr. Phil and I can tell you I've never heard anybody the day after one of them was on say wow said expert on dr. Phil yesterday did you hear how long she talked never heard anybody say that but I've sure heard people say that expert on dr. Phil yesterday did you hear what she said you got to play Big not long you don't want anything you say to get lost in the sea of minutiae let everybody else fight for floor time let everybody else fight for the microphone in the meeting let everybody else stick their hand up in different times when you speak have something to say speak with gravity make a pronouncement play Big play dramatic take the position it's just not enough to keep your head down work hard put in your time and expect a reward at the end because that in may never come it used to be different but we're a highly transient Society now and if you want to get ahead in this world if you want to be noticed by somebody you want a relationship with if you want to get a promotion at work if you want to get a sale if you're in sales you need to rise above the noise what if we said already we said number one you got to find your image we said number to you have to be perceived as unique and number three you got to play Big you got to do something that pops that pops you from the rest of the crowd you don't want to be part of the wallpaper you want to be part of the figure that pops out of the background your current events have shown us that long-term employees are the first to go when there's a downturn that you think it would be a way around right cuz they've been loyal they've been there but you know what they're the highest paid so if you're going to cut 50 employees are you going to cut the 50 that are absorbing most of the payroll are you going to cut the 50 that are the cheapest well they're going to lose a lot of wisdom when they cut those that have been there a long time but they're just trying to make their number so they're going to come in cut those high-priced employees and replace them with new blood so if you're just somebody that just rank-and-file you just keep your head down tail up working hard you just rank-and-file you going to file right out the door you got to be unique and you got to play Big so when they start thinning the herd they go oh wait a minute not her not him you take those other 44 over there but you better cut this one out of the herd because this one is unique this one has really distinguish themselves and you do that by playing big you do that by taking positions you do that by coming up with Solutions you do that by creating memorable moments I would a whole lot rather create a memorable minute and 18 seconds then bore an audience for 20 minutes when it's your turn to be in the spotlight with her it's home with her at work but it's in the social setting you want to establish yourself in a strong what you want to play it big you need to be the one who makes an impression when they leave go home go to lunch you want them buzzing about what you said about what you did about how you looked you want to make an impression you have to stand out in a positive constructive way and decide how you're going to do that before you get there this means taking the initiative I saw a situation not too long ago right on the Paramount lot where two people came in that were being added to a production staff and there were two desk that we're going to be occupied by these two production staff one of them face the door of the executive producer the other one face the wall and the HR person was there and I just happened to be there getting ready to do something else and the HR person said y'all can pick a desk has either one of you have a preference and one of them stepped up and said yeah I'll take this one you know which one she took she took the one that faced the executive producers door because every day that executive producer walks out the door you know who they're going to look at the going to look at her and if she's smart she'll wear something red somewhere on her wardrobe every she'll pop and she'll have a big smile and she'll have something that makes her play big and when that executive producer comes out frenzied frayed looking for something and particularly if it's not her job she'll say you know what that's not my job but if you'll give me 60 seconds I'll find it for you she will make herself indispensable that other woman she going to be over there counting mortar joints staring at the wall because this person had a philosophy assert myself when I get an opportunity to take the initiative I'm going to take it I'm going to play big and want to position myself in a way that works so one was prepared the other one wasn't that one is starring in her own life sometimes it can be just that simple okay I see by the clock on the wall that I need to stop I don't want to play long I want to play Big I've given you three things for your playbook I have a total of 16 I want you to think about these three let me give you a little preview of what we're going to talk about we're going to talk about learning to claim and accept praise we're going to talk about learning to become essential we're going to talk about knowing what your real currency is we're going to talk about something called goals acquisition training G80 how to set a goal and achieve it realistically how to build timeline and an action plan we're going to work on this Playbook and you are going to become equipped to get what you go after and once you get your mind around this once you get your hands around this think what an edge you have over the people sitting next to you around you that haven't been in on this conversation they come to work just like they have every day for the last 5 or 10 years they walk down the mall just like they have before I want you to have an edge I want you to live on purpose so we've covered three There are 16 and some of those have subparts that what I would like for you to do between now and when we talk next is really work on this image who do you want to project to be what are your strengths how can you be unique how can you star in your own life ask people what do you think my biggest strength is 10 people what do you think I'm best at what do you think my biggest strength is they got what are you pulling for compliments as a matter of fact yes I am I want to know what you think my strengths are why are you asking that does it matter what do you think are my strengths I'm making a list and checking it twice write your own things that look back seat what's work for you across time really build out your list of strengths build out your image because I want you to change enough that people are going to notice there's something different about him or something different about her they're carrying themselves different I don't know they just seem more together don't want you to really pay attention to that work on this image work on your streaks work on how to define your uniqueness because that's going to be the core of where we go I want to make this worked point that you are going to be so glad you listened that you're going to tell
