We love you all so much rest in power by the second and enjoy this episode of getting curiouspackage getting curious with Jonathan Van Ness this is someone who believes firmly and not letting fear it's what I have to tell you right now this is already my favorite episode of all-time welcome to getting curious Hannah Shaw author Advocate Condell Advocate people Advocate person I'm obsessed with thank you so much for coming Hannah hi thank you so much for having me so I'm holding two of the most beautiful baby kittens right now and their rescue baby Cotton's even though they look like they could be really expensive cuz you're so Chic looking in it what did you tell me who you think there's like a Bobcat running around the streets of LAyou guys look really fancy but I can tell you what I got them they looked anything but fancy there 4 weeks old now I've had them since they were a few days old and when I got them they were completely crusted with fleas like when I tell you the first bath I gave them the water ran red with blood from them being so eaten by fleas so they look really fancy now but that's cuz they got the kitten lady treatment where did they where did they come to you from these guys came into a shelter here in the LA area and they were born underneath the wheelbarrow and somebody found them brought them into the shelter and this is what happens a lot people find kittens outside they assume they've been abandoned and they bring them to the shelter not realizing that most animal shelters are not set up with the ability to provide care to this young so that's how they understand cuz you're like NICU for cat exactly so I take on the most vulnerable most young orphaned baby soup and separatedtheir mothers and I raised them until they are weaned and healthy and ready to be adopted so in like 4 weeks old in the wild they would still be nursing from their mommy instantly these guys are bottle feeding and if you confess you can bottle-feed it's they're really good at eating now they were oh my gosh. Jonathan is in heaven right now. Should you go to do not tell you that I am a mom cat why did Ed my producers apparently were in a really sleeping when they were napping you cuz it was when they were they were napping when they were booking you because they didn't think they're going to start nursing on your facewhen does love you both so much so people will just don't know what to do with them there are lots of kittens born outside in fact 80% of kittens born every year are born outside on a street to community cats who live outdoors and so people just people who live in the neighborhood they find these kittens in Alleyways under their porches go get wishes there's no but looking really well as it exists that can I just they can lick each others butts if they feel like they need to okay you look like you're having a good time so people will find these kittens outside and a lot of people don't know is actually around the corner but she's looking at you going when is this person going to leave so I can go back to my babies were people scoop them up bring them to the animal shelter and then shelters we have to remember they have limited supplies and resources to leave the kittens have a whole section in my book all about this kitten lady's guide to saving the most vulnerable feline Juju the audio for it I feel so passionate I got this and it's a really beautiful son book that goes through not just how to do the stuff which I'm happy to tell you all the time also like it's filled with narrative and stories of kittens that I've saved from bushes and you know underneath porches are you use how do you use your judgment are you looking for I'm literally crying you guys like what are you doing are you like you like okay Mom I think that could have been mom run over I think that could have been like Mom's not coming back I've been observing the couch like two days they're they're like there's no like what it like how do you dry so if you find kittens outside and they look clean and like they've been eating they are not you know covered in filth are not crying out in hunger probably mom is there taking care of the sting that you want to do that is try to reunite mom and babies ideally in foster care so you can actually foster mom cat even if she's Ferrell and her babies until the babies are old enough to be cuz I'm a mom cat and you're a mom cat but the real mom cats are the cats who live outside we want the babies to stay with them if possible if no Mom returns stupid as babies up and make sure that they have the resources they need but that is really what my project kitten lady is all about is helping animal shelters create programs for these babies and then also helping empower the public to step up in their own way by fostering because this is not a problem that can be solved within the four walls of an animal shelter really this is a community problem with a community solution foster parents so what's the problem is there are a lot of kittens being born outside and the world Community cats with Outdoors so half the cats but a lot of these cats still live outside in our neighborhoods and if we're not doing sterilization programs with them you know we all spay and neuter our our companion cats at home but not everybody knows that you can actually do that with living in your neighborhood and that's going to prevent so many things go get him spayed and neuter to be sterilized and then their returns to where they live so it's kind of like this magic wand and you say okay guys you can stay but you just can't have anymore it's really important because every kitten that comes in to my rescue comes from outside so we want to prevent more of them from coming into that's number one the second thing is people need to know that when these kittens come into a shelter shelters have operating hours do you see she's making biscuits on you she's like a little biscuit kittens come into a shelter they typically are going to meet their feet within 24 hours they are going to either make it out into a foster home or they're going to be euthanized because speaking poorly about shelters it's actually the opposite it's it's shelters are doing so much and they're doing everything they can but they have limited hours they close at the end of the day and these guys you know they're on a 4-Hour feeding schedule they are letting you so much this might be the happiest I've ever seen them she's just like making are biscuits and he's like loving on your beard or so cute right now I think I will make a video after this to get them adopted from someone else before we riding they're going to live in New York City was there to reduce table legs are real are Elisa and bugged yeah you guys are babies weight so anyway what we think what we're doing this is a problem that anybody in the public can do something about and that's really empowering anybody can go sign up to Foster you basically babysit for a couple of weeks and then rentals programs like their local Humane Society animal shelters or you can work with local rescue groups that animals out of the shelter but whoever you faster through your making a difference whether it's through your Municipal shelter or your local rescue groups Animal Rescue Animal catching really depends on what organization you're talking about there's a few different models of shelters there are private Humane Societies which are nonprofit organizations that anybody can start so you and I could say we're going to start a non animal shelter together and that's private shelters but then there are municipal shelter so every municipality in the United States has some kind of animal control or animal shelter and so those are open open admission shelters and what that means is if you're a government-run facility you have an obligation to take in every animal regardless I actually have to go to those little ones usually the government ones cuz they just like they had to get rid of what they don't have room for something it's very sad that animals are killed in shelters and that's what the whole point of this project is it to stop that but the shelters that are euthanizing these kittens that are typically going to be your you know Municipal shelters they're the ones that need the most support they're the ones that need our help so something how to kill animals like when they have the most heart-wrenching job in the world like standing in the eye of the storm trying to make sense of it all and so fostering is a gift not just to the kittens but to the people who work in animal shelters because they don't want to be dealing with this either it's a really beautiful healing thing so how do we sign up to be Fosters well the first thing is that you have what it takes and that's why I wrote the book Tiny But Mighty Tiny But Mighty is it is kind of talking about how the kittens on sale there Tiny But Mighty the also we are Tiny But Mighty like movements are made up of individual so every single individual action you take play is towards the greater good right so every person can do this all you have to do is you don't learn what local shelter or rescue groups are in your area contact them and say hey I think I'm interested in fostering usually they're going to have some kind of an orientation doing maybe a mom and babies or some older kittens so that you kind of get your feet wet in your arms seems like he's like okay I'm home cuz you cuz you said just you just moved to LA and San Diego living on the East Coast before that like how did you decide that you wanted to do this happen to me by accident is already an animal Advocate but I had never actually rescued animals and I was living in Philadelphia this is a little over 10 years ago and I looked up into a tree and I saw a baby kitten looking at me and I thought and that I don't have and I was like what do I do next and shelters cannot save these little kittens most of the time and then I learned that even if I wanted to do it there weren't a lot of educational resources out there to teach me how to do that so far in the intro of my book because she's the kitten who started it all for me and after that it was like my cat eyes opened to the world there were just kittens everywhere like I would see them everywhere and so I became like the neighborhood kitten lady and when people say you're like a cat lady I'd say more like a kitten lady cuz I have always focused on newborn kittens and became my passion because there's a huge gap and resources there and people weren't talking about it and how can you solve a problem that nobody's talking about how can you Empower people to do this if they don't even know about the issues into maybe if they care they don't really know how to do the work so I started my project kitten lady when she was little she had one of her eyes crusted shut she was littler like she probably eat a hotdog I was working at a summer camp and know what I was doing I think I tore up like I did terribly package me cuz it's all I had when I got bug the first know what you're doing and I had to break hey you can hear a free new episodes of getting curious + 2 weekly bonus

Com gbn and use promo code jbf welcome back to getting curious with Jonathan Van Ness okoko with a little tiny baby yeah she was a little baby and she became my best friend she works in my lap with me every single day while I'm doing this and she was the kitten that made me realized when other people signed these cats outside is baby kittens outside to be the friend to them that I wished I had had cuz I didn't have somebody I can call and ask what do I do and not just how do I do this but how do you do it well and how do you go through kind of the emotions that you go through with this because I don't even have talked a bit about how emotional it can be when you're working with a vulnerable animal you know there's not a guide for that now there is it's called Tiny But Mighty but that is like whoa I didn't know either when you have when you have kittens now they look so Angelic this is like the one thing we're at podcast really it you're missing the visuals of two baby kittens falling asleep in Jonathan's arms so cute and she's like holding hands with you so are you lit up your little baby here really the baby this is got to be the most annoying episode for people that wasn't too but I don't care cuz I can't so it is Adam West Wing episode 2000 everything so how does coco like the other kittens so she is separate from the other kittens are so so you don't kittens can carry illnesses and they're also very immunocompromised so they need quarantine space at least his first two weeks that you have them came to me they lived in an incubator for the first three weeks because they were so so small so it really made her a couple kitten incubator is this is my life I have a baby yeah we Tony Kittanning commuters you have they all are buddies and they just hear live in an incubator for the first couple weeks of life and every couple hours or we can feed them help him go potty clean them pee and poopy actually stimulate her baby sick by licking them so Mom cats are amazing in that way they stimulate at the waist which is like it clean and not a target of predators cuz poop is a target for predators protect my baby I will literally eat shit to protect my baby you know you know I don't deal with a lot of parent cats because I mostly focus on orphans and so I actually very rarely have moms and babies in my life and I never have dads and God said be there kissing and making a nonprofit organization called orphan kitten Club 501 c 3 Nursery that also does other programs nationally to help other people do this but we only take on or friends who are so babies who are unweaned and don't have their mom is like a hot mess when they come to me and then we clean him up and get him are you sure these guys are rescued and I like thank you that's very flattering that is what I said when they came to me so we got to get them out or get out so hundreds and hundreds of kittens and they live all over the country and loving homes and I was like a bit so you may be other people who like maybe have like a like a different more like traditional office job like you would you could still totally like be a foster parent you were just like go like volunteer and find out what the center and you could probably even like if you didn't want to have the pets at your house you can probably even volunteer at the location like and even if you have an office job you can still Foster weaned kittens who don't need to be with you all the time you can do moms and babies basically you take care of Mom and mom takes care of baby so you know you don't have to actually wake up in the middle of the night actually worked in office jobs when I started doing this and I just got permission to just try it I always tell people just do a test run because you see if they are not talking to you cuz they're making muffins on you little carrier 23 hours a day is there hardly coordinated yeah and these guys all they need is a few minutes every couple hours to save their life so I tell people if you scroll on Instagram and like all of the few minutes and it makes a big difference it is a really temporary thing so I think sometimes people get intimidated by the idea of being a quote-unquote foster parents cuz it sounds like it's our struggle as I feel like I want to tell me about like why it's also really Fierce to Foster and not adopt everyone that use C obviously that's what episode of the one with it's not okay goodbye is the goal so I tell people goodbye. Chapter of the book because this is a gift that you're giving to them so as you. Say hello to more kittens who are waiting for you so it's amazing personal Journey because you learn that love you. People say I would love them too much so I can keep them but I say like a feeling you have it's an action you take a relationship but you're not ready to be in an open relationship so it's like he used to fostering cats like you meet them where they are and you see that they're struggling and you give them love in the way they need it by the time these guys are 8 weeks old you know that your love is totally transformed their lives and so just like you might cry at a graduation because you're very proud of the child who has graduated you're not going to say I don't want to go through crying at your graduation so we're just going to keep you in school for Cheryl I think so cuz you're only full-time cat how do you scan this is really important because two kittens is would you rather someone not adopt a cat if you're not going to get too or would you do some do better alone star kittens I only recommend adopting in Paris unless you have a cat at home for the kitten to be friends cuz kittens are social they need companionship they learn together they go through these transitions together that it's it's a really positive thing for them to have a buddy if they can go into a home where there is already a cat I think that's great but I don't recommend raising a Singleton kitten with no other life transition so it's kind of love that last September and my grandparents always had like a black teacup poodle for 35 years name JP it because when one teacup poodle and past they would like go adopt another buy teacup poodle in them with JP which I always thought was like I'm a psycho until I lost bug the first and then I was like oh I understand like we don't want to feel the loss and I'm in it was also kind of like me like I had all these cute nicknames for bug that I wasn't ready to stop hearing myself say them like when I come home and I bugga bugga Nina Hagen Hagen chase them that we like kisses nose for like 3 minutes of Lake Forest give guinea pigs cuddle which you totally loves Emperor's are not literally for the kind of his little coaxing on the couch what months are there any really love it like going to yoga and then when bug bug pass I got bug II and Liza Minnelli and I realize after 3 days that lies and I were having issues eating like she wasn't wanting to eat as well as bug the fur or bug II was eating and Jet Li not the same as Larry sounds like is there a bullying issues so I was trying like separate so that she wouldn't be like distracted but then it was like she didn't want to eat alone either and I was trying all these different food that she's like really wasn't wanting to eat not gaining weight like bug the second cuz they were the same age when I adopted them and so. Surge worry me by like the fifth day I was like okay this cats like not eating but really really really affectionate really really cuddly like had the kitten equivalent personality of Harry Leary did you watch my story do you know like how cool he really area Tooth Fairy yes it is very personable we lit all that was really great of you to notice that a lot of people don't notice and so it's already just very like sensitive to like Nino noticing PBI like eating just you know being quick to look at that sort of thing so then I started noticing like a lot of leaking like there was a lot of like poopy leaking everywhere in and I was like what's happening in so then we were doing probiotics trying all these like foods that you know join them for like two weeks at a time like you know like to give her a chance to like try to adjust and not just switching it every 2 seconds and making sure I was in the same food for all the boys across the board and then we moved to New York and by the time we got done filming in Kansas City MO to New York I was dealing with like pretty severe accidents like once a day like it wasn't like missing the litter box by a little bit it would be like you know couch like rug like just not super close to litterbox I was like being it up everywhere and I was like fine then when I got back to New York it was like the week of Thanksgiving and like five nights in a row like I would come up to my bed and it looks like the aerial Golf Course view of like a golf course that is made of like cat diarrhea Lakes like the shape of Gulfport like 18 everywhere beautiful description small little tiny baby make so much liquid diarrhea and she wasn't even eating I finally found a food that she would eat but she didn't eat nearly as much as the other two and I'm like how is that little of food turning into this much liquid diarrhea you get really used to be in training yourself to hear like that like if I heard like that piece down GTM I don't know I guess she cuz I would want to hear like litter grind afterwards I wouldn't want to hear like the p on Lakewood you know like that's what or how do you hide guest list list types of the week of Thanksgiving I woke up at like 2 in the morning to her like pulling my chest and just like you know cuz she was very cuddly like loves to sleep just a most cuddly sweet personality cat and she's sitting on my chest and then I hear the noise but I was confused cuz it was 2 in the morning I was like no it couldn't be like you're you're actually on my chest so I know that I'm not maybe one of the other cat's has diarrhea turn on the lamp next to my bed and she head shet gallons of kitten diarrhea like all over my chest like I was over the comforter but literally just like I'm not telling you what I see like five nights in a row like I'm serious like five nights in a row but at least the first four nights it was like I walked up to it it wasn't in the middle of the night Vitas I found a baton in New York that would help me like really can't raise her cuz I just like I couldn't keep like just being like swimming and diarrhea all the time it was like all the time but that was a really painful decision cuz I was like I really like I was like I don't I was like looking at her like I don't want you to think I'm never going to see you again like you're coming back home but I just can't I don't know what to do or just raking me over coals and he said then I called the vet in Kansas City would help me with help me me when I first talked to them and help me with bug the first and she was like oh my God Queen until I got her back to Kansas City and then she raised her or she realized that from like December to like 2 weeks ago up till like a 9lb totally driving I'm totally gain weight I have pictures on my phone my mom if she lives with my mom now she's out she's about a year old and she's going to come back to New York in September we really quick break will be right back before getting.

is going to house sit for me when I'm on book tour in September and she's going to bring lies the back and then I'll have a 3 cat household so what question about that is this we're not having any accidents anymore we're totally regulated on our food we have our system down but when I get lies a back she's not sick or anything cuz she's been at my mom's house and his effectively been like unicorn t-shirt but she hasn't my babies might bug II and Larry haven't wouldn't have seen her for like 10 months so I need to do like a reintroduction again like how I would have any other time I keep her in a separate like in her safe room for like a week and do the whole sock thing is going to be different so what's going on and you can you make a decision about when when it's right to take those next steps definitely starting with a home base is important so just getting her in a space that she's comfortable you know so that she's just she's got her crashpad she knows where she is she can start smelling things recognizing this is my territory I know where my litter boxes and know where my food is I feel really safe if you're if you're loved and then you can start sent swapping the others and then take their stop and get it to her school that day will see each other and hit it off right away and it's also possible that it takes a few weeks so I always recommend just going into it with an open heart and mind knowing that you know if there's some hissing in the beginning that's okay like that is part of the transition they're just sort of navigating that new relationship in that territory and you know figuring out where everybody falls but I think that you are so dedicated to these cats it's very clear and I think you're going to do such a good job getting them back to equilibrium and happiness cats play fight sometimes how do you know if they're like hating each other or just like normal play fighting screaming really really fearful cat who is on their side tail puffed out yours all the way down big loud it's just kind of you know like tumbling around in the school yard so this is like a lot of me to do things more play general questions but what you're doing lately I've been with bug the first and Larry cuz we're filming right now you know in Philadelphia and everything and I just got to this point where I'm like over not having my cat like I just like I'm going to be I heard that Taylor Swift like always chatter Catholic just judging from her grandma and I was like I want to be Taylor Swift like I want to have my cats everywhere so I started like having Harry Leary and Bug the second coming with me like from Philly to New York at cuz it's like an hour drive and I just don't like having them come with me about the second such an expert traveler he popped right into his old Kitty carrier does it make a sound his ears are pissed off he just looks out the window and is going to come out of the kitty carrier that stresses him out but he's happy as a clam and is all he's not stressed out afterwards you would think Harry Leary would have fun he has that he doesn't mind this cat is the worst traveler you have ever ever ever seen so at first I was like I don't want to drug my cat so I was like I'm going to just not drug you this cat scream loud I've never heard a cat make noises like this it's like I was like oh he'll probably come down a little bit he was making the same noise from the time we left the apartment till the time we walked away from door to door he was hoarse but he was like when you tried Jim yellig normal he was like a cackle you like he was Horus from like using his voice too much so then I was like maybe like a little Benadryl BB gun inside like a Canon that didn't do anything and then I was like what about our friend Gabapentin so I shut to look at a pension there still more anger than a Banshee like what should I do just like put a towel over his carrier it could even when it cuz like he does want to get out of his carrier cuz I wasn't even staying there for an extended period and then he's happy once you realize he just doesn't like chocolate exactly what I did with my cats when I traveled across the country and we have our partner and I have three cats and his cat he's very much the same way they cries the entire time and the Gabapentin didn't do much double dose summers at bat no no no no no you think like a cat when you're wondering when you're getting curious it's more like a wall so you know you just put a nice little blanket cover that's why I even have here like I had a blanket covering them when I came in because it's just it's a little more like a little cave feel like okay I can kind of and just get through these few hours that it's true if it's a totally stressful day all the way through then you know you can't make a cat do something that I kind of don't want to do the other suggestion if you want to have cats with you you could train them if they want to be trained on us because how do you train a cat in the dark side tribe A but they hated it when you have to do it in a very gentle way so that every cat is different with a lot of different ways to be really reduce developed in his knees and we have never seen a cat bend their knees and I got a harness and he literally jumped vertically in the air and then turned over on his back was like back flopping on the concrete you're going to hurt yourself and he was just really big and he just wanted to kind of dragged like he wanted me to dry he wasn't into walking indoors and then just take it off so they're like alcohol when I put this on I get a treat in this is you are positively reinforced saying that the harness is a good thing it's not scary and then maybe the next few know once they're comfortable with that you put a harness on them and you walk outside for 2 seconds and go that's what the outside looks like Larry and then go right back in and he's like maybe also maybe not and I think these guys could be little Adventure cats for whoever they go to cats what are they here I look what I'm thinking about the biological development of kittens because that is my fee open at that point but they can't see anything so when they're born in their eyes are closed they're sealed shut and you just leave them open them are they open on their own between 8 to 12 days and when they really can't see very much they can't focus their pupils don't really dilate to light so they really just are meant to be sleeping and incubating at that. But this stage the ones in your arms there you know they just turned 4 weeks between 3 1/2 and 4 weeks everything starts to change so you start to see more of the iris as the pupil dilates more and you start to see that they actually can track movement in space so all of a sudden only in the last two days you look at the kittens and they are looking back at you first person that these kittens have really laid eyes on because they mostly just now and they can't see anything until right now so I can track objects in space they can try to reach out to different objects they can see something and say I want to go over there with whatever it is which means they're old enough to start having toys they don't play in about the next couple days and like hunting Sunday the cutest teeth in the world you see those little tiny Fang teeth the canines to those just popped through in the last like 2 days for the teething babies does canines are what they used for hunting so they don't have their premolars yet if you look at the side of the mouth they just have gums those are the teeth that are for actually eating meat in the wild they like me they liked everything bores really indicates what they are able to do when they're bored and have no teeth so they might even you know they can even hit you that young but they hit us with this little Gummy mouth and it's like the cutest thing in the world used for anything other than grooming actually like stabbing that's why I'm 4 weeks they start being so that's 4 weeks on the side of the mouth and would be bringing like week prior to her babies and they wouldn't be expected to eat it expected to like take a couple bites and be like next week in dead man tells Ricky our kids couldn't see color they can see some color but these guys they're still not really able to see very much you know they can kind of see movement better than they see color when they can get older or when they do they are they are older they can see some color but they mostly see in movement so they are very very good at observing something that is moving like if they're still nice and then suddenly there's movie think about like a lion on the Savannah and it's still they need to be able to see what objects starts movie imagine if your cat if you're a kitten you know when you're you're looking out at the world you're really seeing a lot of emotion and that is what gets them you know hunting and getting really excited about playing with you that's why I couldn't sometimes bite hands and feet do you have major Larry was a major foot Hunter and and by the second also is The Advocate an expert like an interest only if you will come to you as so many cat issues what are like the biggest like cat parent issues like like like fighting cats or like a sapphire Lee cats don't get along or like a timid cat and it went to be like what are like the things that people struggle with the most baby kittens so I get a lot of the same questions I with that with foster parents or with people who are interested in foster care not your mother's breast she's looking so we can get sunburned through a little extra Jack protected no common things that people ask about kittens the first I would say is people just have a lot of misconceptions about whether like whether they're able to Foster I got a lot of people who are like oh well I wish that I could do what you do but I can't because I don't have enough room in my house or something like that and that's when I say something like that sits like you have room to do this absolutely there are a lot of misconceptions about barriers that people perceive to be able to do this work so they think maybe I hear all the time if I had $1000000 if I win the lottery I'll start saving animals and I'm like you don't have to have a million dollars to start you don't even have to have $100 to start this is the thing that the shelter's sponsor your ability to do that so you sign up to Foster and they cover all your vaccines your spay neuter if they get you know sick and they need medical care really you know a big part of my message is specially in look as if teaching people that you don't you really need to provide is an attention and a safe space to be there's a couple skills that you need to have some things you need to know like for instance these kittens need to be kept warm I can't thermoregulate so you know for the first 4 weeks of Life they cannot control their own body temperature at all they need heat source so that's an important thing for people now it's important for people to know how often to feed them and how to help them go to the bathroom what do you do if you find a cat if you find a cat start to assess the situation and say is this kitten under 5 weeks are over five weeks then that's probably a size 5 + week old kitten fees guys we wouldn't take them into foster care so that they can be socialized for adoption under 5 weeks do you want to do what we talked about earlier how to reunite them with Mom but I have all of this stuff in the book and people can learn really everything from Rescue to adoption and everything in between how to cope emotionally while you're doing it had to have fun while you're doing it so how do we cope emotionally play who let me find this is just something I thought that you might get a kick out of its the color wheel of poop and this is all about getting curious about Kitty which is a very important thing because your your cat's poop is like their report card it kind of tells you all my God she was very beige Berry beige so listen to be as you guys pale poop is often the sign that the kitten the ceiling to absorb nutrients from her food literally that's what it was because she had that IBS and she was absorbing the nutrients I'm a probiotic digestive enzyme can help support kittens with malabsorption concerns we had that oh my God I wonder if she did get prematurely weaned overfeeding was not our case in this book it's meant to be but also a thing that if if you're fostering or you're taking care of a kitten and it's the middle of the night you don't know who to talk to you have this resource and you know I also have literally hundreds of videos on my YouTube channel talking to people about how to do after on YouTube. Accessible form of education for people who are interested in taking care of kittens and also helping the cat to live outdoors in our communities if you have a stray kitten or cat it is important if you are going to bring them into your home like that that's the morning at 2 go to work and you like when you bring the cat inside just to let them out of Harm's Way or whatever like to put them in a separate room in your house until you take them to the vet in case they do have like a contagious disease you donate your aunt like your mother. Quarantine while you're getting them nice and sturdy and roll Boston you know these guys have passed their quarantine now which is why they got to be here in your loving arms Lovin on your beard hope that this wasn't me just petting a cat for 40 minutes I feel like we got good information than we think I love hearing about your all that I delete this is the part that says we're wrapping up is there anything we missed that people really need to know like what can what can what do what do you want people to know about kitten adoption about cat parent ship I mean there's so much so rewarding yes I encourage anybody who is interested in making a difference in the world to consider fostering kittens it is a way that you can see your own power and I think it's spelled out into so much of your life to be so empowered to realize the difference that one person can make it's a really beautiful gift that you can give your you know babysitting for a cup weeks and it gives them the gift of up to 20 plus years of life how often do we have these big problems in the world that are so solvable right I think there's a lot of a lot of pain in the world especially right now and this is something that when you learn that hundreds of thousands of kittens are being euthanized in animal shelters that can feel really overwhelming that I can play our small part in changing that so I would just say you know get out there at you know how to save some kittens lies I have the tools to help you do it so whether you want to learn through an audiobook through a hardcover book through a YouTube video If it through Instagram however you learn best like I am here for you I love people who have stick and passion to save these kittens live so I'm I just I love this movement so much and I'm sick of this speaks to you like there is resources for you to get involved is 5 cats too much for me I've no idea I already know the answer if it's not too much I think that everybody knows their own boundaries and it's important to listen to your gut and listen to your heart and you know do what is right for you and screaming to take these two home like a cat uterus inside of me what is going on I'm doing really I don't like him anymore looks very maternal with these babies end in a year Jimmy listening to getting curious with Jonathan Banda my guess this week with Hannah Shaw you'll find link to Hannah's work and socials in the episode description of whatever you're listening to the show on follow us on Instagram and Twitter.
