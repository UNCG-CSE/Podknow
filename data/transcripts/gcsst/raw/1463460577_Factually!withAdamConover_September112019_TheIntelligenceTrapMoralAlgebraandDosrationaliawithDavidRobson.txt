talk to the 15 years in Supersize Me the fast food industry has undergone a makeover nowadays Jane restaurant sort out in food that supposedly healthy and organic well in his new movie Morgan Spurlock is exploring this new reality with an even more immersive a person last time this time he's sitting out to open his own chicken fast food restaurant check it out in supersize me to Holy chicken now in theaters and on digital rated PG-13 for brief strong languagehello everybody I'm Adam Conover welcome to factually and it all of literature few characters stand for the clarifying power of rationality like Sherlock Holmes yes he was aided by his pipe a magnifying glass and a hot new wonder drug called cocaine but Holmes his greatest skill was his ability to reason through a problem rationally and skeptically he said for instance that it is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence and biases the Judgment I was going to do a full British accent all right I'm not I'm not trying to dialect but it seems like these that made homes the archetype of a hard-nosed critical thinker for Generations after him I mean I'm a fan of Sherlock Holmes myself I read all the stories and you know one of the appeals of the character is that we'd all like to think that in our best moments we think just as logically as the famous Consulting detective right so it might be reasonable to assume that his creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who was himself a doctor and public intellectual was just as rational as his creation rightwell unfortunately quite the opposite is true Doyle could not follow his own iconic characters advice even though he was the literal inventor of homes as no-nonsense Ultra empirical approach the investigation Doyle was susceptible to the most obvious claptrap Holcomb and straight-up bullshit his age had to offer spiritualism the fan in which wealthy English gentlefolks came to believe that quote Spirit mediums could communicate with the dead and Doyle went all in on it the dude was insatiable he attended 5 or 6 amps is a week even believe his wife Jean was able literal psychic present in 1922 on a book tour Doyle met up with a famous escape artist a magician Harry Houdini in Atlantic City and out doing knew that Houdini was grieving for his mother's death so he did the friendly thing and suggested a seance where his wife Jean would try and contact the late Mama H on the otherdied in a hotel room doors wife Jean sat with a pencil in her hand and entered a trance she been banged on the table cuz Spirit was present she asked the spirit of she believes in God and then made the sign of the cross then Jean started to write frantically and when the Sands ended she had 20 pages of material from Houdini's ghost mom. Doyle. This was amazing it was like holy crap my wife is talking to your dead mother what do you think about that don't you feel better now Harry Houdini who we should remember was a genius at tricking people and creating Illusions called to scene out for what it was a performance he had a couple of natural questions like why would his mom a Jew respond to the sign of the cross and more importantly why would Houdini's Hungarian mother suddenly know how to communicate in English so it was clear the Seance was a sham no question right but Doyle again a brilliant man who created the most analytical character in all of literaturerefuse to listen to Houdini's valid empirical points in fact he went so far as to write and publish an article dismissing all of it in his criticism and claiming that Houdini himself was a psychic medium now this is clearly the height of a rationality but at the same time we can't say that Arthur Conan Doyle was a dumb guy coming to the contrary he was brilliant healthy Revolution was in a tires jonra of literature the problem was Doyle's intelligence actually work against him when it came to understanding the truth about spiritualism his brain by Kenny is like a powerful steam engine see any load a top speed but that means if you loaded up with bulshit you can still end up on a one-way trip to the wrong station man I know how to over extend a metaphor look I previous podcast I interviewed a psychologist David Dunning and his namesake Discovery the dunning-kruger effect explains how those who know the least about something are the most likely to overestimate their abilitiesbut it's not only beginners and amateurs who get things wrong intelligent people like Arthur Conan Doyle and even experts fall into their own mental traps the truth is knowledge and intelligence do not form an impenetrable shield against are well the teachers more about that our guest today is David Robson a science journalist who wrote a fantastic book called the intelligence trap this book covers all the ways that smart people leave themselves into false beliefs and what they might do about it and it is full of fascinating stories just like the one I just told you about Arthur Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini without further Ado please welcome David Robinsonwill David thank you so much for being on the show I guess it's completely my pleasure so we understand that people who are not very expert in a topic are likely to get things wrong we had David Dunning on the show and he talked at all about how having a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing and can make you overestimate your own competence but smart people get things wrong as well and how how does that happen and we generally get back Sports is the people who are most likely to understand any issue best and so they would be most protected from errorskip I mean that's what with so country shirt if when I began to look into cannabis science of intelligence and decision-making because we could accept that smart people educated people aren't perfect but they're always going to my mistakes but you would assume that they would be generally less likely to make mistakes but I actually will you find his bill. That is true in general there are lots of situations are actually greater intelligence expert Azle Education Connection we amplify your errors so you can really cause you to be more wrong than if you are slightly less intelligent and I'm in my book the intelligence tripod kind of explosive forms of this phenomenon with lots of mechanisms but my favorite is really decided motivated reasoning which is and that's kind of why I like you have an opinion maybe it's like really cool to write and say like it's kind of political ideology or a religious belief and that kind of emotional toll is so strong that it just kind of completely redirect to reasoningso rather than looking at the facts in a really rational going to be open minded play you just use your intelligence to justify your opinions and to demolish any of the arguments against this for example can explain why I love the people who made you have a mole capitalist kind of political ideology more likely to to deny climate change in my best to teach scientific consensus I'm actually the more educated the more likely they are to deny it so it's barely you can see how that intelligence there was actually backfiring it's causing them to reject the fence and take to have this kind of pretty irrational belief so even though it's sort of like even though they're the premise of their argument is incorrect in the conclusion is also incorrect in a dispassionate objective you would let you know that they are so intelligent that they're able to manipulate the argument endlessly in order to find justifications for whythey might be rough right like any of those arguments might even be like internally consistent in some ways except that they're they're happening because I'm motivated reasoning is that the idea when I gave her political example put one of the favorite kind of stories or anodized I use my book is the case of African and Doyle so he was in the intro of a please elaborate on it incredibly intelligent and the kind of analytical scientific way to say that incredibly Crazy Otto's fabulous Nobles but then he had these kind of old ideas about spiritualism say he was fooled by countless going to fraudulent mediums exactly mediums exactly the sort of people who Sherlock Holmes would look through you know how many Sherlock Holmes stories are oh someone there's a con artist who was given some kind of false impression and then Sherlock Holmes finds the Gap in itfigures out that this person is pulling the wool over everyone's eyes to heat it wasn't just that he was so intelligent he knew you really knew very well be kind of principles of deductive reasoning yeah he was applying most because of this kind of emotional toll because he really wanted to believe in the order of the afterlife so he just kind of use the intelligence to completely demolish any of the arguments against to even when his friends were trying to tell him the fact that he was friends with Harry Houdini The Illusionist was also a skeptic when it came to spiritualism listening to Houdini's arguments he just came up with this really does all right at the Houdini himself must be a paranormal paying and that he was kind of for some reason trying to connect cover up his tracks by persuading the spirit world and I I feel only a genius like off of Conan Doyle's could have come up with such a bizarre explanation for something stop bleeding Leo.for the Falls thing that you believe and that's why it's a trap ride because the more intelligent you are the better you are at coming up with Arguments for wrong ideas is that a psychologist talked about kind of intelligence is being a little bit like the engine of a car so it's obviously it didn't have a powerful engine cuz you can get places more quickly but that's only useful if you have the kind of checks and balances to make sure that you're going in the right direction and I feel like you see a very similar parallel hit the United intelligences the engine of faults and United Station kind of feeds into that but you also need to make sure you're applying it in the right way of ways it's just going to drive you off a cliff in this play the Reese's Puffs Conan Doyle if you don't have other positive habits I guess elsewhere in your in your life or in your mental your mental world then you can very easily end up going onon the wrong track yet. They kind of have it so I can intellectual humility so always questioning what your assumptions are with you might be wrong mindedness in a curiosity which has now been studied very vigorously but scientific research and you say that more Curious people who are always looking for facts even if it contradicts the previous beliefs are actually immune to this kind of am I motivated reasoning and now I like to think of myself as a curious person that sort of part of my self-identity but I would also imagine that a lot of people are falling prey to the strap that you describe also maybe feel that way or feel that they have good mental habits right there is certainly there certainly climate change denial list who who are very intelligent and believe that they're intelligent and believe that they have the correct habits of mind that everybody else is wrong we just happen to know because of the overwhelming scientific evidence that these peopleincorrect so how does one tell the difference if the capacity for self-delusion so high even experts of mental capability to some show David darling told you say curiosity that's who I believe is at Yale University as I kind of put more objectively measure curiosity so it's the kind of thing like when people came into his lap he would leave different scientific magazines out on the table and he would just leave pleasure oh you know what I picked up just some of our Maxine not related to science or just kind of what happened to Syd Barrett not kind of build my mind in that way he found but then it was the more Curious people the people have more likely it's kind of look for evidence just for the fun of it look for new ideas just for the fun of it who was immune to this makes me to breathewhat's interesting is that that wasn't so let's play biking of educational of a measure of intelligence the Curiosity seems kind of mental trait that was having a separate fact from that makes basic reasoning about how the expert mind is different from the NX remind that once someone becomes very expert on a topic or sort of mental processes change can you go to that at all yeah sure enough to be taken as an elitist argument I think this is going to sing Express actually just needs to be best especially people who have a great deal of expertise should be self-critical SL critical as anyone else and and I think it's very intuitive to say hey even if yours are on the top of the of the intellectual Mountain you should if you think you're not above criticism or above selfflexion that's certainly an error and I think that's a fair argument to make when people have a friendly and that they start to kind of well that's a number of different prices these automatic and intuitive and expertise that can allow a doctor to diagnose someone as soon as they walk into the room I think that's going to happen within 30 seconds the same way we all know someone who went to the doctor and the doctor insisted that it was a certain problem and the doctor was incorrect but they refuse to listen to any of the other symptoms I got some very common experience will have a doctors offices are the doctors has this rigid diagnosis because even though that kind of intuition often is correct like in about 15% of cases it isthe problem is that finds two things taken if their entrenchments and I believe in the rain expertise they become very close-minded to any other possibilities, is it like in a very quick very efficient but it is also broken glass High School number of cases that lost face paints just don't really taking into consideration got it you've written about examples where even Geniuses are LED astray by their expertise and you call it the Nobel disease which I said for his I love can you go to that price but I do love it I mean I'm not sure if we know the exact Origins but United States to little bit by science right just let myself after they won that prize staffed and come up with these really busy fairies the address so unscientific and sometimes quite dangeroushe kind of discovered or invented the polymerase Chain Reaction that's behind old genetics testing so you know I really like a revolutionary movement and biology United it's really really you can't underestimate hit you come over estimate his genius. But then in his broker fee he writes all these pits all right it's like he's a climate change denier he was in a nightstand. Alyssa he denied that the HIV virus causes AIDS he believed he was upset by this kind of glowing raccoon alien who could also speak he believed they could travel for a basketball play like couldn't be have stranger place than he does is that if you came across those police think it was the same mind that had also come up with that amazing YouTube element in biologyand the fact is that he I think he just suffered from motivated reasoning and also presides over which is when you kind of feel like your achievements I-5 just giving you the right now to be close-minded you just believe that you will and judgment your intuitions must be right without questioning them about updating your beliefs if new evidence is dangerous because lots of people with Finkel Kary Mullis has won a Nobel Prize so he must be right about these things but the scientific consensus on the overwhelming evidence shows that he's not we are talking about a similar case to that on our show a couple years ago we talk about the case of Linus Pauling who was the Nobel prize-winning chemist and American intellectual celebrity and then should have went nuts and started to believe that vitamin massive doses of Vitamin C could cure all manners of diseases and that's actually a big reason that we now believe that people people erroneouslyvitamin C can cure colds and and things like that but it was that exact disease where you know he was able to go on every talk show and interview in every magazine because of his celebrity while this guy's this guy's a genius and so of course he must be he wasn't taught these things through but it wasn't none of it was true it was all a fantasy yeah he won two Nobel prizes one for chemistry won the Nobel Peace Prize in a bowl of it at one of the greatest quacks because of this strange belief the vitamin C with this going to kind of cigarettes just protects good cancer treatment and believe that they could just change my biology by eating lots of fruits and vegetables which is never going to work yeah there's this sort of bizarre tendency weI have to believe that other people but also believe about ourselves that success and genius in one area must mean that we have it in all areas like you see it in your eyes you see it in the tech industry in a huge way where these Tech CEOs sort of you know I'm a programmer so I should be able to figure out the exact nutritional composition every human needs to survive and they create something like Soylent which is nonsense or Elon Musk example where you know the guy creates the PayPal and you know he's able to get in a pool together good people to be no build a build SpaceX and stuff like that but now believes he has expertise and transportation and you know human psychology and neurology and all these different fields and we all believe it for a bit we alter to buy the line until it until it's what it reveals itself as as not truecat yeah totally and you know I kind of think like a my book I discuss about these kind of extreme examples you know Steve Jobs was another one so he actually a great Visionary like I'm so creative and his designs but then he kind of the same intelligence the same amazing brain power also caused him to pull himself with his own diagnosis of pancreatic cancer so he was one of these people who did surgery and some doctors think that he could have survived the pictures come for the conventional medical treatment originally so you know we still face experiment samples and I also fascinating in the rain right interesting really important is the fact that it's every day you say it's you know who I think that's doctors of forensic scientists are Judges lawyers girls that's acceptable to all of these problems and that's having a huge factor in our medical system of justice systemkind of just overlooked at the moment because we shame that the way we train people in the way we caused by expertise is enough and it really isn't enough yeah we give those folks when you meet a doctor you assume that they have this this General high level of expertise about anything and it's easy for them I sent to believe that about themselves but it is so often that knowledge Port yeah you sign please say enough in case I intend to 15% of diagnosis of wrong and over all these diagnostic air has caused more deaths than common illnesses like breast cancer and Tropic can be corrected So This research from a rose stem shows us that like if you. Listen to their intuitions but then to kind of look for the contradictory evidence of the nightly pulling in the afternoon supposed to point of view you can reduce volume by 40%it's a really profound effect for you. Not much it's not a huge intervention it doesn't cost anything it's not requiring any kind of early specialized training just you know encouraging them to follow up I'm out at full price S5 so I really think like you know that are easy solutions to these problems but we're not even recognizing the problem until all have in common that ideas for stepping out of yourself and maybe distrusting your own immediate mental processes your own immediate intelligence and finding ways to check yourself externally perhaps mythical self distancing which sounds like a kind of talk about your problem is if you're in the famous bowl fill out every day. I'm starting a new job and your love life by new house and you just stopped looking for some privacyDavid wants to go for this new opportunity because of this but the downsides might be that David will do this blah blah blah it doesn't sound like sophisticated thinking but it does describe this little bit of distance in the way you're considering the problem I got a very slightly so you kind of price the evidence rationally without just cherry-picking the fence that you want to believe given your first intuition it's such a difficult problem though because what I think about things that that I'm an expert in might like if I'm an expert in anything it's comedy perform live you know as often as I can have been doing it for over 10 years and there's so many times that when I'm going about that work I just need to trust myself right I actually don't have the time to pre think what I'm going to do for every single show and sometimes I just need to go up there and say hey guess what I've got I put in the timeand I'll be funny on stage I know what to do I can let my body take over I can sort of let my building skills takeover I don't have to stress about every single moment and I find that I need to do that sometimes nor did you could work isn't maybe if I'm stressing too much and I'm less money on stage you know but this is your sort of describing that wait no we we need to constantly be down which frightens me a little bit of someone who like I don't need to rely on my abilities, self-reflection and wellness because I've been getting lots of professions and especially creative ones let your own you know you kind of have to go to the flow in the moment or you just going to kind of charcoal Lisa of nipt Hudson Oak right before my reflection of toys that you can maybe try to take the motor sense Approach at the end of a show and just kind ofwe should probably do it right and just been critically low letting that much and that's it and that's how people to steadily improved I'm and I think it's the biggest difference between the peoples of state to succeed in the people who died and it's just whether you're willing and capable of applying that self-reflection so yeah I think like you know obviously the way you apply depends on the job at Hand by an element of self-reflection is essentially Noble professions it can be painful though like the the comedian self-reflection is you tape your set and you listened back to it and it's so painful to do that sometime like I take so I can I tape and I never listen to it because it like why it takes time to listen to it but then also know you hear that punchline that didn't work and I feel bad about myself as I can go hit it's difficult in that way and so it's it's very easy to go through life without having that self-reflectionbut sometimes it did put me in situations where it couldn't really does like North Korea guide not kill sense of like who you are but I think you do come outside and what is a you read about a process called just rationalia can you tell me about that the University of Toronto and his wife actually is has going to specialized in learning difficulties dyslexia what kind of problems with reading and writing all related to someone's intelligence is kind of an isolated issues and he wondered if that's also true of rationality so ever you could have someone who is incredibly intelligent on a lot of matches in schools and their older IQ but they do have a particular problem with rationality why he looked around to see if I was to look at those kind of classic cognitive Pisces the people at Daniel Cohnand I've studied at the Suncoast affect initial attachment to the investment that you've made me so you just pull more more resources into a project even when is failing and actually losing in a much more money in the long run Clio unlikely to suffer from the Sun Coast bias being really smart in an academic sense does it make you more rational according to these particular cosmetic Pisces that's fascinating so the idea of someone who is very very well educated and expert on a topic and intelligent broadly but is specifically has a problem with rationality that's a type of mine that I haven't really thought about existing but it makes sense that there are people like that it sort ofanswer to take a people who fit that description for me in front of like a Matchstick down with something and you kind of know you been like I kind of have to correct step by step is quite straightforward but the problem is that just because you were able to apply that brainpower doesn't mean that you actually do it all the time so often you might just go through the world thinking kind of intuitively using heuristics but not really kind of thinking first things first step by step for this discussion Aaliyah extremely intuitive in your approach to everything rather than sword explicitly laying out your logical steps of thoughtI think my story problem and businesslike with mention that is playing some spicy station organizer intuitively an I-9 related to you apply your intelligence just to justify a lot combination I think is the most disastrous almost everybody who works in business at like a manager level or higher very very educated intelligent successful but completely irrational and entirely engaged to motivated reasoning is like every every boss I've ever had to say which is like a wonderful institution by would be totally lying if I said it's not prevalent by you know I just saiddefinitely Problems by sociological work looking at corporate cultures and finding testis Phenom phenomenon known as functional stupidity discourage your employees to be full for a little curious cuz I might start asking questions I like it might interrupt the productivity of that thing can see much but the problem is that they're not just love all of these by season are it's going to accumulate and at the end you can get some serious issues so please don't play using my book is the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe with a person who is to blame it is just the kind of multiple people from night sing me a virus that caused the eventual explosion of the organization focusing on finishing its process and on everything going smoothly which disincentivizes people from Raysing red flags and using their minds rationally and said everyone's Focus sound like just make sure we can move on to the next step is that the sort of issue with the Columbia disaster and Let Die hit really focused are alike speed and efficiency and so let the employees accidentally wood turning a blind eye to some serious problem with plenty of warning signs in love Sofia can I have a previous flights but they had just because they succeeded I hadn't been asking like what we should learn from those warning signs and that eventually caused a disaster and say I really could be really efficient. Also be asking their employees to take notice of birds Wings in to investigate them and give them the freedom state that this is actually very helpful for my own work because you don't I will make television we have this big process we have to turn around a large number of Scripps in a short. Of timeI need to be researched and written in fact checked and it's on everything's on a treadmill you know it's like okay we got a deadline coming up a week from now okay this is this is the picture or the story great let's research a great let's move forward okay now we're going to start writing it and the moment at which someone on our staff has a hold on a second this actually is not really true or we shouldn't tell the story this way or just an error and what we've been doing that's hitting stop on the on the conveyor belts and I should have said to hear about that treadmill that's that's hitting stop on that and it's destructive to the process but also we're so focused on getting the process as smooth as possible so that things aren't people have to work late every night that there's like a push and pull between those two things and you don't want to show we've done Corrections episodes we've talked about things we got wrong though it when I look back at why those things happened it was awesome because we were trying to keep the process running smoothly all right that sounds great let's do it let's not ask too many questions right and so we've as we've beengoing on tried to building more and more room for anyone our staff to say hold on a second there's a problem with this topic let's talk about it a little bit more so that there isn't that disincentive problem and I think that's exactly it is the easiest way to avoid that is to just build in the kind of room and space to kind of makes you know if you finish early that's great but you have to have the space to an Allegiant correct an error please try to avoid because often you are kind of losing losing that time when you could be produced in Wilkinson said just like I was in the kind of team High Rockies itself is just making sure that the managers and the people above are willing to take criticism from the people below and they'll respond to news even if they don't especially like for the Herring rather than just kind of only telling people to come to me with good news old-time bring it to me it's all right if you don't do that you can end upassistant it's a lot like that genius who gets things wrong you can end up with an organization that is very very functional at doing shity work is this movement of like a company's try to be like relentlessly optimistic and positive is that they're trying you know they will lie sometimes you just have to accept that I'll run downstairs and some ideas about I did something like that doesn't reflect badly on the person who came up with them like you know we don't want to find the person but having had a bad idea but you want to be able to have the kind of freedom to my knowledge that like someone's made a mistake on for them not feel scared that they going to be punished because of that swell all this is so fascinating GIF take a quick break but we'll be right back with more questions for David Robinsonfolks factually is

absolutely free no credit card required just go to Acuity scheduling. Com actually that's acuityscheduling.com actually okay we're back so we've been talking about all of the errors that intelligence and expertise specifically can lead us into you know I often think about the state that I was in when I first got to college right when I was like really starting to try to understand the world around me and I was like very I knew very little but I was extremely like open to any sort of new idea in any you know letting my curiosity take me where it LED and I often think of that as being like a really special state that I try to come back to in my own thinking and that makes me wonder from your perspective and I haven't researched this issue what advantage is our minds have when we're not experts versus when we are experts are there ways in which we are more flexible in our thinking or anything like that from us and Buddhism Zen mind beginner's mind that phrase yeah constrained by its previous experiences violets flexible you know I'm the only danger is that we want to build expertise and knowledge but we still want to maintain that kind of curiosity and open-mindedness to two things to my question are assumptions so you always looking for ways to update your knowledge rather than feeling that you're learning has finished its know where else to go because you know everything already often that it seems that even happens in an art for instance I we've all had to experience it like the artist who we love their best work is done in the early years then after a while it gets rid of calcified and and you know like oh how is this the same person who did such creative things then is doing such boring work now. a lot of artists coming to their own much later in life but there's also that we should understand it to another that's how it works a little bit I mean to say someone at the castle if it was always going to be nobody to him changing his agency was freezing and they hit style and you know I think that is something that is special and unique to some out what is a note to office it's like always kind of being on your toes and ready to adapt and change into explore some new idea. Coming but I think it's something that everyone can kind of try to learn to adopt in whatever profession that doing it to chess players is that right yeah that's it so you know if bacon it's like they they have this huge memory of like tens of thousands of possible moves like that very very high expertise like a totally new random configuration they like really struggle to kind of understand the knowledge that got message. Studies have like the London's taxi drivers who they make and take a test they like in London they have to memorize all the different streets like the tablet GPS in their heads right but I mean I like the cityscape is always changing and especially around like the Glens and kind of East London that be lots of new buildings built an actually be expert smooth enough seats really struggled to incorporate my mental math because all of the previous knowledge was just too deeply entrenched and you can say that would have a professional accountants or computer program is actually struggle to adopt an upgrade their knowledge when you change has come along I remember that being a fear that I had when I was younger when I was in that sort of beginner's mind stayed about the world cuz I was so curious about everything and then encounter someone older than me and their 50s who I would try to get excited and some new idea and it says I don't really care but like who you know I'm not interested and I remember thinking why are why are why are older people or people who are very smart so in curious about the world right and how do I avoid that as I grow older and so how do we how do we get that serve beginner's mind in our daily lives as we continue to become more expert and continue to age truth about good looking into enrolling I like a journalist sleeping around 4:20 or 5 to you is cuz I just didn't I always did have a Fresh Approach in like they are just more Curious that is some evidence that Curiosity can be cultivated and what's I find especially interesting as it's like the more you start learning a new subject the most curious you can become a bouncer and because it's like you know you start to realize that they're all these going to hold that you don't know the difference between the book and the beginner it's just a bit more aware of those connect apps to my knowledge and I want to feel them and if you're an expert what if you were next person you should start to kind of asked those questions and to just think what would I like to know in just to try some kind of new questions that you just might not have considered before such as always be questioning yourself just actively looking for those gaps in your collagen and really seeing them and trying to fill them cuz I want to learn about geology geology very little and I was like at it I was on vacation and and international Park and I was like I don't know anything about it I haven't figured out yet how to learn about it I'm working on it but it isn't that sort of that sort of cultivating of like I'm here sorry I don't know that I want to find out about that let me see the world in a new way of example like if in my book is that Richard Fineman the physicist who is like you guys seem to just maintain that Curiosity right up until he died very strange project while he was just fascinated by this small Soviet Country Gold to think it was cold stuff he United it's just that just by the random conversation around the dinner table and eventually he was just absolutely hooked on that learning the language and I was very difficult to visit because it was behind me I'm concerned but he came out with all of these ingenious ways to try to arrange travel and he just seemed very good at being able to see the spark of an interest and sees it and allow that to to kind of really build in his life and light up his life you've written a lot about how wisdom is also saying that we should strive for and how that can help us solve these problems can you talk about that maybe a bit too intense sometimes too kind of measure it but they might be hungry very robust but then there's been some really exciting new research by eagle Grossman at the University looks like it's actually kind of looked at the philosophy of wisdom in a from people at Socrates to the present day and try to distill some really important principles that seem to come up again and again and what do we mean when we say wisdom as if you had talked about knowledge and expertise but wisdom we need something different what what do we mean by that when we say that it's basically the capacity to achieve your goals and live a meaningful life and you know that is defined by these different kind of traits like intellectual humility so recognized religion perspective-taking like being able to get a different viewpoints and integrate them know what the stuff that has been discussed and phosphate but then was a who is kind of ignored by science in a way where we have the IQ test and so he Grossman design B's greatest who does people taking of disgust peristyle Ms and then up a psychologist would write them on these different traits and then he would he found that those schools actually predicted people's life satisfaction and health and well-being and relationship satisfaction much better than standard measures of Education or intelligence you looking at people's decision making in real life and their ability to make the decisions that really mattered it's time to building the best life possible and what is evidence-based wisdom that something you've written about as well as the eagle cries when an officer giving is looking at ways to improve wise reasoning but with a solid scientific basis behind it rather than something that you my reading light Deepak Chopra Royal United States help help book is that really trying to steal carefully controlled trials just like in you know you might with a medical attention and we've shown that if you play the Saints compared to a few things play the techniques that you get better outcomes though. Wisdom as a form of woo-woo or or an anti-intellectualism or or anything like that it's a no we're talking about something that's very discreet and and measurable that we can scientifically study and that you can deliberately cultivate engine NYC like I don't see it being in a position to intelligence by just say it may be wisdom in this context is really just looking at whether you can apply your intelligence correctly and fairly rather than just falling prey to all of those kind of tramps the way discussed previously party rockers about how the life of Benjamin Franklin can teach us how to use wisdom in our lives can you talk about that got to tell you so you so you know I think it's important to acknowledge that Benjamin Franklin United looking back he had some kind of some issues so you know he was a slave early life what I Hate That Was a Serial sexual harasser so these people has quite serious. The product of a flying like what we now know of as evidence based wisdom I'll certainly in Benjamin Franklin's political negotiations such as the signing of the US Constitution you know he was able to kind of guide the discussions to find this kind of compromise the actually they eventually wiped and just managed to please the most number of people and he did say explosive areas of his life to you know he was a very like he really believes in science lecture humility and respect to take a mess radio Fiesta in his writings and he has specific techniques to achieve and one of them is moral algebra which is a bit like doing a kind of pros and cons list but he was just dedicated to the whole lighter and a bit more systematic do I heat it is every reason for his initial conviction and every reason to believe that lasts for like a few days to kind of letting you I just popped into his mind and in and make sure that he wasn't just going to go in with his initial gut reaction then he would number diamond white them up in which African of which rapper was the came out with the kind of high school would eventually going to get his eventually be his decision that is just this way of kind of a plane will analysis deliberative thinking chill life rather than just going on your intuitions and making it more of a process and more ingrained in the process of metacognition you're thinking about your own thought process and you're the feelings that that are coming up based on what you're thinking about and you're trying to isolate where those feelings are coming from and whether they should matter to you I suppose yeah that's exactly it some you know it's kind of like making sure that buys a regular part of your thinking rough and just kind of a shaving that it will come naturally or easily it's kind of right knowledge in that you actually need to Fly by Night free stuff if you're thinking should we be you know when we're trying to make a decision and trying to figure out if our intelligence or our expertise at leading us astray when we have those strong emotions about one course or another they are those things that we should be using our our metacognition to disregard or should we even be employing them in some way I need to employ down you need to recognize your emotions and intuitions and that's some good recite showing match Elite that you know if you just ignore your emotions completely you can be stuck in this kind of analysis paralysis what you just struggle to my any good decisions because we really good at kind of giving a signals from an unconscious processing and you know helping to guide us ways then post the problem is that they can also be swayed by really irrelevant get the job right you interviewed on a sunny day because the interview a mystery it's the kind of good feeling that comes from good way of a kind of fuel performance in the end I don't like I don't have a bad feeling about this person because my socks are wet by Phil but then a way that I could be in France in my position so I need the people who had just a bit more aware of the SFA loans in general I'm better able to describe them and spice less susceptible to those kinds of Pisces intuition but we want to be more critical of them in war and to think about them anymore unless when will interrogate them rather than just taking that as evidence that you know we might be right do you think that the problems that we run into with intelligence and expertise in while I was going to say this country but this country and England and and and the other sort of abroad countries weed weed classified as being you know sharing our culture around these ideas is it are any of these problems because of the way our culture traits intelligence educational sort of issues or are there anything to be learned from the ways that it's done elsewhere safely so you know I think like I from as far as I know you like the American and English education systems do you value can have the same qualities so we can have rewards children hoping for a quick at learning and answering questions you know it's always like you can put that up first and also the question the quickest is like a reward in the kids who might be sitting back and being a bit more deliberate if I find it at the more we had a shame that like if living is easy for some of them are letting it necessarily the case search now looking at the science of memory and learning China actually when you learn the process of frustration during learning connection Lamprey if you're like longtime recall and Joe Kennedy for conceptualize but in England in America we try to avoid any frustration or confusion we won like slick text books that present everything in a very fluent and easy twin stamina and you know we're going to teach kids like halves of a problem then give them the problems West what you see in East Asian countries especially Japan that this is being studied extensively approach that they might benefit students benefit from what's gold productive failure weather actually giving problems really not have cell phone just asked to solve them even know that it's frustrating when they're actually been told and and the teacher explains how to solve the problem then having been through that process of frustration that learning is actually a lot better to the factual and standing on that conceptual understanding is so much better than a memory later on it so much better having pain free the process of frustration why am I getting the kids to give him longer to kind of answer questions it's not just the kind of rice but who's the quickest since no one of these things that seem to just encourage deeper thinking approach I need do you say that the seams to result in what kind of curious curious open-minded intellectually humble mindset April says not just improving my loving it's kind of just in couraging better thinking and reasoning over all right if your if you are confronted with your own failure to understand something and you have that feeling of duration of course you're going to be more intellectually humble overall but that's true it when we have a great deal of expertise we can tend to want to avoid that feeling of not knowing the answer immediately it's I can come to my Google I can use my reason to come to a conclusion very very quickly that's going to satisfy me and make sure I don't feel the pain of not knowing or being at Sea with a problem but really that feeling of constant fluency can can blind us understanding the issue and that means that you know it's just more likely to preempts that kind of error is because they're not trying to cover up the the kind of folks and I think and I think that's something that we could definitely learn in the UK and the us to just call to pay a wise way of reasoning right from very early on in someone's life Rutherfordton always kind of making every so easy but like when people come to the real world I might have let really complex problems that don't have an easy solution preventing them from kind of just expecting that they will be an easy solution I'm trying to kind of falsely claimed to have that particular answer to a problem is more rewarding to I mean this is so is that a change in example but like I play a lot of video games and in video games the other sort of two trends like the trend that is more popular now is to tutorial eyes everything tell the player exactly how to do what they're going to do and then to tune all the challenges so that you never give them a challenge they don't have the knowledge of how to overcome and so that they serve almost never fail you a lot of games are designed to be a little bit challenging but you're probably not going to fail that often you actually just have the flow experience of overcoming every single Challenge and that I now find kind of boring in the games I enjoy now more are the ones where you're thrown into a situation where you are almost immediately going to lose how are you can't figure out what the goal is and the only things wrong you through is your knowledge hey this is a video game there must be a way to solve this problem I just have to do it through trial-and-error I have to use my own knowledge to figure it out and actually become good at it and that is such a deeper more rewarding experience because that's how you actually end up building a skill within the within the world of the game and you know I can think of that the same thing imagining and learning I don't remember taking a German class in my college were instead of none of the instruction was an English it was just an entirely in German to the first page of the textbook didn't have a word of English on it you just have to figure out through context clues what the words meant which is more frustrating but it was so much more I mean I know what I know I knew what those were smashed because I had to figure it out for myself you know that's why you're kind of off to just guess the meaning of the words without actually being told what they are thinking about getting it wrong to eat then learn a lot better and your memory is so much better later on to all kinds of areas of life that we just need to be more conscious of accepting ambiguity and confusion and struggle saying that something to fear or to ignore or to cover up that something that should actually we share price as an essential part of the thinking process that if you do that then you're going to be protected from all of those other problems like motivated reasoning later on because you're not just trying to justify yourself you're trying to actually find the best possible solution to what time with this when we're talking about those people who are very very intelligent and they're using their reason in order to justify false beliefs via motivated reasoning we talked about ways to avoid doing that yourself but when we're confronted with someone who appears to have a great deal of expertise appears to have a great deal of intelligence is giving us a very fluid argument for why we should believe that climate change is not dangerous or any other sort of similar argument and we are trying to evaluate whether or not that argument or that person is on the level how can we do that how can we tell the difference between the intelligent person who actually knows what they're talking about and the intelligent person who is just using their their powers of reason to spin falsehoods Sprite you know about such an important question where flight the kind of political M Landscaping the way it says we really convincing material that kind of the day for you look the more it kind of crumbles easy solution but do you think that you could have gotten back to the principles of critical thinking so you know we can learn about the common logical fallacies of argument still seem convincing bachli what are you looking for that actually looks really proves the point that I'm Still They just they create the illusion of an argument rather than being a good argument by Matt with tennis touching the process of misinformation and false argument and lots of different contact so you know when they strained kind of students on the tactics used by the tobacco industry 17 * 6 days to question the link between smoking and cancer teaching people that specific contacts can actually protect them against misinformation and O'Leary's my political conspiracy theories off climate change denier listen so it's just how things going to plant red flags in my brains to recognize like when you should start to interrogate an argument woke up late so I think that's just something we can all do is just maybe try to look a bit Thief tried so kind of you know read read about those kind of previous cases and then apply that same kind of thinking when we with talking about politics today or you know the environment or anything else that's important because I was going to make this is this inspired me to ask you this cuz I read I don't remember where I read it but it was a really interesting argument about skepticism as a process right where skepticism the dangerous fall into this exact same pattern where be you become so skilled at skeptically question and looking for fallacies things like that that you start to apply it to areas that should not be you know that what you say is going to demolish arguments that are actually true in exactly the same way your reason become so good that you're able to do that and then the line that left out at me was you know it's not rational to disbelieve something that's right in front of your face right and you know exactly the same way a climate change denier would say right when really they're there at just believing what's right in front of your face so how do we then make sure that we're not over using because I obviously want to stink skeptical and think critically but we could fall into that exact same trap if we overuse that same process in a motivated a rational way something with bass researchers have found an example Dimensions when they trained the people about the tobacco industry scientists and then presented them with misinformation about climate change what was the price and I was actually the one full against the strap that you described saving people who would not truly more right way and we'll come to list you know should be on paper more likely to deny climate changed they were actually still just too skeptical about the material on climate change denial has them said they had kind of an emotional and motivated reasoning because they knew you'd be kind of tactics had been used and I really misleading I previously with the tobacco industry one of the recite just you said to me that no one wants to be Hoodwinked really like you know if you can appeal to that sense of like wanting to be right in wanting to know the truth and if you can try to kind of and still been someone that you will overcome the other kind of emotional mites bites simple answer for number search to just actually what you've described as less likely to happen then you might fit so we can still despite the fact that intelligence and rationality and skepticism in all these things they can lead us into error we should still have trust in these General process is to to lead us in the right direction overall as long as we're still having those good wise habits of mind pizza Kenosha and terrica evidence on anything let medical issues climate change night to question that but it's just looking like on the phone balance is the evidence for climate change more convincing than they are against climate change and you know I think if you look at it really honestly and without that kind of bites based reasoning you do you say that the evidence for climate change is more convincing things that sit like this always going to be some areas that gray or some holes in the argument but you just trying to kind of balance them and see which overall seems the most convincing at the time of of you doing the analysis this is fascinating stuff I really think you're coming on the show to talk to us about David cool thanks so much it's been a pleasure did David Robinson for coming on the show his book once again is called the intelligence trap check it out and that is it for us this week on factually I want to thank a producer Dan awakens our researcher Sam Rodman and Andrew WK for giving us our theme song and hey if you want more fascinating information or if you just want to find out what I'm up to head to my website Adam Conover.
