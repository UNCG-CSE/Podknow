Day Danielle and Dorothy never made it home and haven't been seen in the 26 years since that day I Marissa and from wondery this is episode 189 of the vanished Danielle and Dorothy's story sunizona Arizona is a very small town just north of the international border between the United States and Mexico the large picture family composed of Dorothy and John picture and they're 14 children had settled there after moving from the East Coast back in 1993 6 of the 14-pitch her children were still living at home the picture struggle to make ends meet but made sure to take time with each child for small treats and play dates on this particular day Mom Dorothy took Danielle along with her for her walk to purchase cigarettes for her husband at the store several miles from their residence for the story we interviewed one of Danielle's sister's Dawn shared what life was like in the Tiny Town of sunizona she remembers about Danielle so silly she was killed loves to sing and she had this picture in her voice when she sang I can't even do it but she would sing and she's just happy and silly and she was great you know we all had our little mix and we all usually so go buy them to this day that she was just a funny happy-go-lucky good person the reason why we went there is because my little brother Jesse had severe arthritis and he was all a lot and so they said the warmer weather and also because my nana my mom's mom loved it down there so we went there and then we lived in I'm down the South Side we lived there for a few years and then my parents just moved to Kansas Settlement Road in fact she hadn't been to sunizona until after Danielle and Dorothy disappeared but this is how she described the town I moved to Boston and then that's when my family moved to some of them and like I said I never been there until this all went down and I went down the road heading to the store the only traffic that would be on that road would be the people who lived on its dirt road it's windy it's only people who would be there's no reason to rush you were going to visit somebody there's no reason like a 18 wheeler truck wouldn't be driving down those roads May 23rd 1993 was a warm spring day that started like any other Sunday the picture children went to church while parents Dorothy and John pitcher stayed home and spent some rare time alone together when the children arrived home from church John offered to make lunch while Dorothy went to the store to purchase cigarettes for him the family had a car but Dorsey prefer to walk for exercise occasionally if it was too hot Dorothy would ask for a ride from some locals who passed her while she was walking as Dorothy was getting ready to leave she asked one of the other children if they like to accompany her on her errand but that child declined Dorothy then ask Danielle agreed to go along with her according to the family Danielle and Dorothy left in proximately 1 p.m. to go to the store when they left they only had the clothes on their backs and $3 to purchase the cigarettes left behind all of their belongings including Dorothy's purse which was normal for her to do on her walks around 1:30 p.m. Daniel's older sister Dina so they stopped by her house but left after a short visit Dorothy had asked Dana if she wanted to accompany them but Dana declined because she wasn't feeling well around the same time sunizona local Danny Morris claims to have seen them walking along the road leading to the store Danny and Dorothy knew each other and Danny told John picture he would have offered Dorothy and Danielle a ride that day but they were going in the opposite direction with this timeline of Mind Don walked us through what happened that day my little brothers and sisters went to church and my mother and father were home and when the kid came home from church my mother and my youngest sister Chantel if she wanted to walk to the store with her and so they walked to the store it was like a two-mile walk but that's how my mother got a police officer K-9 and pick up the scent of my mother and sister leaving the house walking to my other sister's house Dana where I forgot to add that they did ask Dana if Dana wants to go but then I had recently just had a child and so she said she wasn't feeling well I'm wanted to stay home but come back and get us so we can go have dinner with you guys it was each way so I would say probably I mean depends on how fast a water how low they walked so maybe 2 hours and they would also frequently take rides from people who offer someone if they knew the person who pulled over I mean it's very very small population of someone I would assume they didn't have a house phone at the time and saying what happened why didn't mom and Danielle so they went looking pretty much the desert or the highway to walk and then so my father please the Cochise County said you can't do it for 48 hours later they came and did they walk to the store and then they watch the main that was just a preview of the story if you'd like to hear more about the many twists and turns in this case subscribe now on Apple podcast Spotify or whatever
