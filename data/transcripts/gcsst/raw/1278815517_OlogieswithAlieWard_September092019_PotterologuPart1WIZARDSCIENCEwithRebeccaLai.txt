Rebecca lighteventually fade away again because of chemistry is really what happens is that this ink out basically made in a basic pH such as like Peach 11 to ph13 the colors of exposed to are such as you know that Sarah has CO2 in that so what happens is that CO2 carbonic acid so carbonic acid neutralizes with the base which is sodium hydroxide that is in the egg dropping the pH she around page 9 or so when that indicated at pH 9 is actually cuddlist yes we hit the ground running we blasted through a brick wall and straight into her showing me a Muggles way to simulate the spell aparecium attempted by Hermione in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets to read hidden writing from one Tom marvolo Riddle diary so not a wizardno worries that special blue ink is basic but neutralizes in are to be invisible on the paper so it she swiped a liquid point of 5 molar solution of sodium hydroxide raising the pH again to very basic and a message pops back up on the paper chemistry lesson magic Intrigue hidden messages in a diary that Professor like gives me to take home this is literally before the interview even began and I got to ask her anything about her classes and I swear it we pick up the microphones like normal in a minutegreat because we're really having a real class about it and I remember students seeing seeing this class on the website a catalog Universe I can receive a credit I said yes absolutely you have a clammy of group project that you have to work on yes absolutely it's not because I'm his only for 1616 slot and it always ended up you know the cost will close her early because it's just kind of school would like to take the cost just to have that on their transcripts to Harry Potter's chemistry all right let's get into this tell me a little bit about your background when did you realize that you love chemistryI actually I was saying like chemistry when I was in high school but I do have to tell you that it is a bit unusual but I choke actually in my whole life I've always liked Arts until my first year in college I was still going for fashion design on fashion merchandising major my whole life has been into you know arts and design and what happens when I took a chemistry cost in my first year and realizing that in college I went to Cal State Los Angeles and realizing that I really like chemistry and I think there's a little bit Maddox reasondo you actually get this straight okay I should try to think about this career hunch was confirmed when she was getting her Bachelor's in Biochemistry at California State University and met her undergrad research advisor dr. Zhao Zhao I really learned about the transformative ability of researcher so he basically taught me a lot about how it is to do research and also how to be a scientist basically to have a scientific mindset and I think that's very important ideas to how to approach a scientific question that's really the time that when I look at me now you can actually do so much with research and that's when I decided to switch to biochemistry Majors to do you think is a scientific mindset how would you describe it so you know you have to figure outthe question and then you have to think about how you going to approach it and there are multiple ways to approach it you can't be like I want to try that all all of them at the same time it's not possible in some cases it might be possible why do is to systematically Isley one part of the questions because some scientific questions I really really really Broad and really complex the how to isolate arson attack small towns at a time and be able to achieve get to a conclusion because you can think of it as like a network of you know questions are all related so how am I going to prioritize which part I want to address for and you have to think about the amount of time the resources and all the others right simplify the question or at least address one part of the question at a time and even within that one part of the question you would like to address you have multiple approaches to address a question that is very difficult to try to address everything at the same time no matter how big the lab is I think in generalChevy cross SSG think systematically rather than trying to go I like this I like this I like all of them if you have to and okay you might go back one hour or so I'm going to just so you keep turning did Rebecca have a necklace nearby that look like Hermione's Time Turner pendant imma let you guess also before getting her bachelor's she studied at a British school in Hong Kong but for her PhD in chemistry she went to the University of Texas at Austin and then did postdoc at UCSB so what sparked this interest in lab work you like was it like solving puzzles as you go what did you like about it I like ice i consider that as you know it's not as good as a veritaserum is not truth serum but it is truthfinder at the end there's a truth to all these things are happening in in signs and different chemical reactions even at that moment I may not know there's always an answer to it I think it's always a truth in science the weekend at this moment fancy enough to be able to understand it weather is about a pathway in the human body with diseases or just new technologies we may not be all of them but I think it has I think I like science because all chemistry all science in general is because it's truth finding I think it is I really think she even if I don't know and understand all right now but slowly and surely I'll get there that's how I look at it I unscrew until I study electrochemistry so then when I decide to go to graduate school I want to continue on with that Rebecca said that she had great mentors like undergrad advisor dr. Fang job PhD advisor dr. Alan fard so if you have academic dragons to slay it's good to have a posse I'm guessing both of them were more Hermione and less Weasley now Rebecca herself seems like a kind excitable Hogwarts professor and when it came to teaching you got to design a syllabus and you are clearly a Harry Potter fan when did you read your first Harry Potter book actually I would say it was probably the time that the first one came out oh that's very cool is really cool book so but I didn't actually I had that book then but I didn't really get into seriously studying it completely digested learning all about it until later quick aside a little background on the books the first in the series was Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone published in 1897 in the UK Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in 1988 was the US version and name change which was suggested by the publisher Rowling says that she regrets it will talk about it more later so fun fact the initials JK were to sidestep any issues with young boys who bristled at reading a female author now. J stands for Joanne K stands for Kathleen she didn't actually have a middle name but now the first imprint of the book was a scant 500 copies and 300 of those were sent to public libraries in the UK which means than a rare sign first in print complete with a few typos and some Miss number Pages has fetched nearly $90,000 at an auction earlier this year so evanesco your life savings that means the Disappeared book is probably one that I read the most number of times I think the others that leaves around 7 or 8 that one's probably 10 what was the what was your impression you're reading it what really up to you I just thought amazing I was thinking very much at that time you know I wasn't thinking about having this cost yet or chemistry creative how awesome JK I thought she basically came up with the world real world that's new unique and all her own that all other ideas you know up could be similar but yet at the same time I think you know she really the Gentry she really has to snitch right that you're generating you know a whole just a whole world that I think it's uniquely her and I was at that time I was really amazed off of writing ability and also just be able to generate come up with the world like that because I've always been to ours actually I wrote short stories self never do anyone but you know I've always been interested in writing stories and also a Sci-Fi and things like that so I think it's actually quite amazing to be able to come up with an idea like that because there's a lot of internal logic you have to make it consistent yes you can generate also Syfy world it is. A Japanese animations a lot of them. Based on something really unique sci-fi ideas but you really have to maintain that logic throughout the series I think I think she thought about it a lot even when she first wrote The Sorcerer's Stone so that will how to tie everything to be consistent and I'm still very Amazed by that on this very inspiring and it's kind of like how chemistry is consistent it's predictable because of certain chemical laws and physical properties are asked to all the reactions as well it is very very much the case from previously been done and you start to head fans what you are going to do or what you're currently doing is very important in chemistry and science as in writing as well I think in creative writing and storytelling is analogous in some ways we need a first strike you as a chemistry professor that damn I can do a whole class on Century Potter ology exactly sorry I squealed you see there is absolutely correct what you just said that idea I was talking to my friend who's another professor here is dr. Barry chunk and I've always thanked him when I have these podcast and talk about his classes because he really helped me and encouraged me because I am at that time I basically asked you must really like to do this honors cost at university allow these type of things I mean to be set in a basically he said there's nothing to do was just try it try you don't know and that's why I did and I was entirely surprising yeah yeah so University of that was it and showed up the catalog. Students looking and just like all that. A student ask me about weather should get the credit for it I was like yes yes well and do a good job so well Rebecca also teaches their curricula in much simpler form for high school and Elementary after-school programs are University class was for honor students and it meant 15 or 16 weeks in a row and having read all seven of the Harry Potter books that is over four thousand Pages it's over 1 million words posers need not apply now I wish we could have made this a four-hour episode because she covers everything from the science of invisibility cloaks to the Spells petrificadas totalus which freezes your foes and chemicals in nature that can simulate it like Haitian zombie powders from plants and the deadly puffer fish neurotoxin that blocks the conduction of nerve impulses along fibers and a Suns comes from bacteria in the pufferfish not the pufferfish itself so not a wizard can't cast any spells that's fine just get yourself at 34 fish this class is amazing anyway so that's that's how it started and I think it was just it was just great just trying to come up with a syllabus off what I would like to talk about and it's just it's really it's good fun I think he's setting up the class and thinking about how to run this cost to make it fun but Sue educational I think that's always going to be the case because after all it is a chemistry course and then we'll be greeted and they should learn things right as a chemistry professor as a scientist I cannot you say I have a class is all good fun fun scrape but they have to learn things I have to put effort into it and I think at the end I definitely received because we have students evaluation for all classes and I definitely a few students mentioned that despite it seems like it's a you know a fun car and what not have learned a lot since they learned a lot about largest chemistry but Science and Technology at 12 but I would like to mention this class is that either homework there's also of course at tendons point because there's class participation they need to ask you no answer questions and participate in class discussions as well so these are all part of it but but before I want to get that I would like to mention how the class the first thing I did on my first class was that I sorted them into houses for those who have never read the Harry Potter series in totality Hogwarts is Harry Potter's Wizarding school and it has a different house is kind of like fraternities but for cool witches Ravenclaw mascot Eagle colors blue and bronze values creativity wit intelligence and learning ravenclaw's kind of seem like a guy at work is always reading books on his lunch hour good on you Hufflepuff mascot the badger colors yellow and black values loyalty Justice hard work and patience I feel like hufflepuffs are the friends to help you move in colors red and gold values bravery gumption chivalry courage Harry Potter himself along with his buds Hermione and Ron Weasley indoors gryffindor's ultimate wingman and finally out colors green and silver values are leadership cunning resourcefulness and ambition they seem kind of like hedge fund account managers of tomorrow like congrats you drive a Benz but you need to also pop your collar I don't know if I like you but I admire you know in Hogwarts the talking Sorting Hat Bellows your house before how tall of students but I'm Rebecca's class she feels it was such a paper and then let fate decide I pass the hat around they'll pick one if they pick the green green snake logo the slytherins logos with a Slytherin that if they got the you know they got the Raven The Raven calls over the blue logos over Ravenclaw and then excetra Hufflepuff and Gryffindor the rest of the semester they will sit with a house cost together but I split them into three houses not a piece of paper and I left it out overnight on that desk ready for that show to let the Hat make some decisions right okay you've got sorted into Slytherin as a hat problem was it was quite funny to I think in another class I think the 2013 one of the students that she was the end of the semester she actually the slytherins and learning more about the cause and working with the other students because I stored them in his team's right now despite the fact that she was truly unhappy I could see her face just like I'm just sort it mean the Slytherin us like the Hat story so independent they came into the cost wanting to be in this house or the other they all ended up learning something about different houses and enjoyed because making new friends too because by you know having them together for the rest of the Master with each other and why I also mentioned that is because they are house points and I have four jars and I have I intend sypro just a style of Swarovski Crystals full color of it because the sapphires you knew the emeralds and then you know you can think of with the rubies and then the yellow one end up choosing something that's more like a toll pass right for the hufflepuffs and I have a bags of these crystals and then in the beginning they are omt Sulphur jars and then when they answer the questions correctly Turn Point basically right because they have these full moon o big jars they're not really Charles but call him so that you can see how many you would they gain house points will be open the valve and then be like to the bottom as usual you think of Collin College classes most people who has a question. Like I want to answer your question I know you answer but I just don't want to just kidding but you could see Justin and realizing that I think no matter at what level or K-12 level Everyone likes to have final projects in the form of a presentation and everyone in each house has to participate no ducking behind the loud person in your group Wallflowers. Rebecca had me guess the last two winners and they were Hufflepuff and Gryffindor and I was dead wrong guessing both times literally the last house I guessed each time I might as well get muggle tattooed on my neck PS I checked around and yes there are people out there with muggle tattoos on their necks and I said we salute them on your side today so I need to give you some potions but I do want to talk potion so tell me a little bit tell me about the lessons that you run through I want to hear about the chemistry lessons on your syllabus at you relate to the books what are some big takeaways that you're able to give people based on the book so first I started with anything and turn it into gold so I talked about the history of gold and why the chemistry of gold white gold is something. So solid off to back in the mediaeval times right as such a unique compared to other metals and less a metros Etc so I talked about gold I sent to you last year's talking about gold and I think I'm based on this student evaluation the gold portion end up being at you the most well-liked letra what are some lessons about gold what are some takeaways cuz I would have died and out about you know macroscopic gold versus microscopic go like gold nanoparticles and how a microscopic go it looks cold and color and compared to you you know microscopical when the when the girl becomes like going out of particles very very small has a reddish color and how it ties too many other things including Arts is that if you go to a cathedral all places like that basically red stained glass contains how did you know that about gold nanoparticles I did not so teeny tiny gold particles less than 100 meters show as an intense red color well larger particles or Nano rods absorbent counter light differently and they presented as blue or purple gold is like hey just cuz I'm call Gold doesn't mean I'm called so I talked about you know the chemistry of gold or what it means and why you no talk about other objects of gold objects in the Harry Potters Road and compared to and talk about European tell me about you know Rodger bacon and albertus Magnus and how they also thought that gold being the perfect metal and that fool the others are all you know just not as perfect and they also thought of this idea how it ties to the Sorcerer's Stone and. JK Rowling uses idea which was an idea that was real that people thought about can we make something or discover something that is so good so much more perfect than ghosts and could be used to transform or make change other base or metal such as iron ore and anything else to reach the Perfection of Court basically convert them into cold so it's related this idea of the Philosopher's Stone I would say it's not original idea but she utilizes idea very well in her books but it is an actual idea to sign up for those who aren't up on centuries-old Alchemy gossip a philosopher's stone was a real thing looking for a philosopher back then they didn't necessarily mean someone in like a turtleneck writing essays about nihilism but rather literally a lover of wisdom scientists know who was albertus Magnus or the big Albert he was a thirteenth-century fryer philosopher perhaps an alchemist all those Scholars disagree about the degree to which she dabbled in Gold making but he did believe in the occult powers of rocks so if big Albert wore a bra have a crystal tucked in it we both know it. Rodger bacon was a contemporary of Biggie Albert and he had a reputation as a wizard he also reportedly owned a mechanical bronze face they could answer any question you asked it this was called a Brazen Head kind of like a Magic 8-Ball but metal and look like a decapitated head so knowing all of his back story about real philosopher Wizards and stones and gold yjk was bombed that she was the publisher change it to sorcerer for us Americans so who was it who urged the change it was one or through Lavigne at Scholastic Books who thought philosopher just wouldn't grab us audiences and he suggested instead the title Harry Potter and the school of magic and JK was like but compromised with Sorcerer's Stone did I look up Arthur Levine I did he's at Arthur a Levine won on Twitter he lives in New York he owns his own publishing company out is about 2400 followers so if you were to tweeted him and say wow dude that was all you he might even see it and reply but be nice though cuz that is quite a dual Triumph and a burden to carry okay back to the wizard Rodger bacon who I'm sorry Wizards named Rodger the best as far as I knew Rodger is just today for stepdads where the guy in accounting who are stalkers but must have a wild dark magical life outside the office is actually thought that gold is off and something else is called The Elixir of life and that something cool Acqua di Gio which is nitric acid and hydrochloric acid which is something that no one should be drinking at all whatsoever that you can see it's also interesting in a while. How JK Rowling also you use this idea I mentioned this elixir of Life related to you the Sorcerer's Stone but this idea of a likes rough life was around as well but it did European Alchemist Rodger bacon but of course it's different chemical but yet at the same time I find it kind of interesting why Acura Gia why they like I do not know why he would consider. Selector of life and giving this solution this name but it could be because Uncle Regina is known to be able to dissolve gold if you just at the HCL you put the gold wire right there you do not see Energy Solution now she's just at the Nitric acids right that you don't see the dissolution but as you combine them together you can cease generating a beautiful dissolve gold solution which is a golden color yellowish color solution had what happens is that they quizzical 3 plus right there is going to eventually form this gold chloride which is a Chris is also soluble and that's what you see in this yellow solution right there so Kenny's chewy reaction equations basically is telling exactly two story going from here with a solid gold right that's all it does is Google's wire to become this gold chloride which is aqueous basically the liquid for on the stone cannot do that B3 Parts hydrochloric acid and one part nitric acid exactly the Philosopher's Stone that Harry is trying to protect it does look in a beaker kind of like a glowy orange aperol Spritz cocktail which can be magical in the right amounts and caustic if too much Goes Down the Hatch so what if your gold has been cursed into a slushie jar and you needed dry and solid and like gold again what if you're going through TSA what can we do is that we can actually conferred back again and that's one thing the magical part about gold is that the only gold many of them you can do from a solid form to a solution form and then you can precipitate out which we just mentioned that we use a courage in to dissolve the salt gold wire a gold ring into the solution and then we can actually precipitated out you see that's what it what one could do it now it's a queer reduce solution contains only goal this be Shuffle real solution and Andy want to collect these powders back on so that is small portable we can walk around with his caustic solution everywhere I can interest you have to use to take it everywhere so you want to bring it back into its snow powder he's form so what happens is that you can blow off the excess excess aqua regia and by removing a residual nitric acid by repeatedly heating with hydrochloric acid so you might you will be able to obtain the saulet tetrick Laurel or a casa too so you end up getting this salt right there so now it's back into this song called reform that you can take it everywhere at that time I'm sure it's very magical to think about you can go from something shiny beautiful solid and then go into a yellow solution and then doing some chemistry right there right to be able to transform it back into a powdery form so that you can take it everywhere Rebecca had pulled up some PDF slides to show me a pile of powdered gold surprisingly looks less like a glitter bomb and more like desiccated mustard so chemically in a mug leeway how do you completely reverse the spell you want a beautiful Shiny Gold again you can selectively reduce it with sulfur dioxide or hydrogen you can get back to the shiny gold and then you can make you a gold rings or any other thing so it's just think about the gold cycle from solid to liquid to the powdery form and then reduce it back to you you know the elemental gold of the shiny gold and then use it again and go through the circle is very I really do believe you know if I were living at that song I don't know what woman was work on that would be just very magical first chemist ever to poody a perfume maker in Babylonian Mesopotamia 3,000 years ago she was not a man fox now in the first woman to win a Nobel Prize but I'm actually speaking of novalis and spells and Gold & sorcery with aqua regia that it was actually used it with a Nobel medal yes it was used on that because during World War two of those are gold medals because at that time German prohibited the export of these Noble metal outside the country Germany did not allow people to do that and yet the two Nobel laureates would not like them metals to become something other than what they really want so they actually gone through this process and ended up having to convert it into the powder and then ship it out and then off to the war was over it was recast it back as soon as the metal basically exactly going from this this is so hard to just so you can see what the process I mentioned he was clearly useful he was a chemist you help them out to as it says wanting to have them metal not be destroyed or are they wanted it to be shipped out but how you can disguise it how can you and what form that you can ship you know precious metal out she when it's clearly prohibited and it illegal to do so so I think these type of methods of very useful little Nazis are the worst trivia so the golden Nobel prizes belonged to Max 1 low and James Frank and Hungarian chemist George to have a c dissolve them in a beaker of a Christian as the invading forces were literally marching the streets of Copenhagen this dissolve gold remained on a shelf for years despite the laboratory getting ransacked by Nazis who left the beaker untouched because Nazis represent extreme ignorant evil PS if you're like can you imagine being smart enough to win a Nobel Prize I will never be that perfect I just want you to know that on the official nobelprize.org site on the very website that affirms the story there is an the Miss typos so let that be a lesson that Perfection doesn't exist but perseverance through obstacles and failure of course she talked about Nobel Prize who doesn't want to have one I mean what does it mean we have a tiny small amount of hope I think most would like to have 100 grams of 23-carat gold 24 carat gold is pure gold so that's a lot of money but later on cement is changed now it is just a hundred 75 grams of 18 karat gold plated with pure gold but actually a screen go to basically is the silver a silver gold alloy if you have heard of what green gold is basically silver gold alloy so they've made it a little bit cheaper the value of a Nobel Prize to the person who received it is a lifetime well beyond that website US dollars what my 2007 Prius is worth so it's a good it's much more than that it's also the amount of work to go into that to you know to continue to believe your own idea because a lot of times when people first start at even if you were to ask a few of them a lot of them / up perhaps I didn't think the idea would work out but I just got but you know and I know she'll trial sings we're not working I could have given up but you know but I persevered again and again and eventually believing one's own idea and eventually be able to get there I think there are a lot of that kind of story if you interview on different you know Nobel laureates I think every singles Korea it's just like I came up with this idea and I tried it and it be continued to always like that I like that but but they're also cases in which people you know truly YouTube for Sofia to really you know got lot of challenges but they were not giving up so they just change it work at it and ended up becoming successful in doing what they you know set out to do so including JK Rowling who started this look at it in a napkin I know coffee shop Monday to meet with my gosh I can help me with enough tweets perhaps one Rowling will learn of doctor lies to her do you think also on the topic of napkin drafts I've looked into this further and Rowling says that she had the first ideas for the Harry Potter series well on a train from Manchester to London which had been 4 hours delayed also JK Rowling's parents met on a train to reasons perhaps why trains and terminals might make such Charming appearances MPS train nerds please see the what is episode ferroequinology for more shockingly kid-friendly train information anyway JK started writing the books by sketching the characters perhaps on a napkin and then much of the rest of the books in cafes as a single mom herself nursing one cup of coffee for hours while her newborn slept in a stroller nearby it seems that the scientific method of a hunch followed by a trial-and-error plus determination works not only in the lab but also will staring at a blank page on Rollins website she shared her struggles and advice and she says it took her seven years to write and publish her first book because she was convinced it was rubbish she continues just giving the pep talk of the century writing fear of failure is a sydes reason on Earth not to do what you are meant to do ultimately wouldn't you rather be the person who actually finish the project you're dreaming about rather than the one who talks about always having one to do ultimately in getting us in life your job is to do the best you can improve in your own inherent limitations were possible learning as much as you can and accepting that perfect works of art are only slightly less than perfect human beings Pop Quiz how much did I cry while working on this episode so inspired by her if you guessed a truly embarrassing about and thank God you were alone house points to your house as long as we're getting mushy each week we donate to a cause of the ologist choosing and its peak Rebecca chose pbs.org in PBS provides content and experiences that Inspire inform and entertain over-the-air online in the community and in the classroom nearly 50% of their funding comes from Individual donors and yours so a donation went to PBS.org in Rebecca's name that donation is made possible by having sponsors and here are a few words about them before we talk about spells and Technology I have talked about care of on this podcast before it's a subscription service that delivers vitamins and supplements their customized for your specific Health needs you go on take care of., can you take a short quiz you answer questions about your diet and lifestyle your Fitness and your health goals maybe some of your struggles and care of puts together a personalized vitamin and Supplement Plan just for you I love these the quiz took like 5 minutes and it also offers scientific studies about particular supplements in case you like it tells you why certain supplements are recommended and the data behind that they also have protein powders in individual on the go packets so unlike the past when I have been stopped by TSA for having a Jar full of white powder in my luggage little bit easier to take along with you it's so easy especially since I travel a lot and it just keeps me motivated instead of opening up 10 different jars of vitamins me like do I need this one it's just there it's already customized for me I already know exactly what I'm taking and why it's in the right dosage it's awesome also when they ask you what your name is feel free

Picking all the spells that are the most commonly used but I like the ones that thing which I can talk a lot about the science that is used to make sure that you know substances such as water will not affect it of course it was used a very much when Harry was playing a Quidditch game so impervious basically making sure that my glasses will stay perfectly fine in the rain just like Harry's glasses when he was playing quidditch in the air right prisoners of basketball and he was playing in the storm right now if you haven't seen or Reddit Harry is being pummeled by rain it looks like CNN hurricane coverage just lightning chased by ghostly dark Dementors in the sky I do not know what kind of liability insurance Hogwarts has but it cannot be cheap so what do we have it's up in purchase actually used in the other locations as well in the book but I think the most famous example that people relate to as the one I talked about Harry's glasses you know that her mind he's basically always as smart as ones impervious you do OK Google define go win the Quidditch match today don't complain stop it exactly that's what you're saying I will not recommend that is very good for your car right for the car windows the windshield and same with aqua Palace basically they have these polysiloxanes I have functional groups that end up buying to the o h group on the glass surface and the full making it the surface chemistry that you basically making it difficult for polar solvents such as the surface so products like Rain-X have compounds called Xanax that have functional groups that find the glass surface and that changes a surface chemistry making it harder for solvents like water to wet the surface and aquapel is another product that has fluorinated compounds and that binds the glass service so windshield Wizardry with magic for Muggles another way the impervious Bell could work via chemistry Rebecca says to turn your eye or rather your sem scanning electron microscope toward Locust leaves leaf green itchy but if you look at it under you know an sem and they could you see you will see that they have these cops are staking out and that's one of the reason why you never really looked out to see those asleep being super dirty it's because of using his noddle structuring having this Nano structuring a fact that enables water to just Roloff and taking the dirt the dirt to soil particles and walking out with it so you can see the rain water or two and then just go away if you think about that structure and do you need do you need service off that Lotus Leaf from a fall we cannot see that but people know that's research right you know the fact is that people first of all have to build powerful microscope Tobago see it if not they would have no right to buy seeing that they're like wow okay why how does that happen having these small little nanostructures sticking out how could this be a self-cleaning technology knows it once you know the science behind that they use it to do a lot of things so I can have a pain scoliosis on we actually got up some sample in the lab that they gave us for free because I mentioned about that I'm using this sounds for education and you can paint the wall and then when it dries it will have these little spikes and not know features on microfiche you're sticking out so that if you paint the wall and then the rain would just so that all these things will not stick especially with outside of the house is very important to write so again you can think about it information people obtain a when they study Lotus Leaf When water drops on these Ultra hydrophobic Lotus leaves these are no limbo plants Lotus plants it beads up and it looks kind of like a ball is just sitting on the surface and it turned out that the more boy me and ball like the water droplet looks is an indicator of how hydrophobic the surface is so imagine the difference between a bull overturned on a countertop vs. a partly deflated basketball on the countertop versus a pretty much fully inflated basketball so the angle of contact between the droplet in the surface even has different names Wenzel is the kind of deflated ball shape and Cassie Baxter is the round or droplet so does anyone I need a pen name for a fantasy or sci-fi novel your newly inspired to write may I suggest Cassie Baxter side note that Lotus technology exists in hydrophobic shirt which is perfect if you're a proud slob who can't do an impervious valve or if you just want to Google hydrophobic shirts and watch people intentionally spelling barbecue sauce on themselves then marveling in Wonder Rebecca explains and they would they also have model structure shirt as well we actually have a shirt that is in the lab if you spray water on it all your coffee it just rips they will completely not apps that make that fabric is using utilizing the Lotus effects is impervious it's impervious absolutely and that's how I look at it as impervious because they have a few spell such as Amino scourgify and tergeo is also about self clean house you can Harry's will they have that when things get dirty but you can see we also have self-cleaning technology right though right then so versatile sodium hydroxide. I covered quite a bit by the by would be the incantation behind that invisible ink from earlier and that can be used to reveal invisible writing or invisible illustrations Hermione attempted this term again on Tom Riddle's Diary to no avail is there was nothing written in it also Rebecca is the best she gave me the pain with the invisible ink and the base to revise it and I kept it as a Keepsake in my purse all through my road trip Journey weeks later I was home taking measurements for a new refrigerator I took the note with me to the Appliance store and the paper was blank so mobile shrubs now what other spells does Rebecca Through Chemistry The Conjuring 2 for his curse is basically a curse that cause great pain to the victim's eyes so that was used by Viktor Krum during of the Goblet of Fire Triwizard Tournament to use this cursed to affect the dragon's eyes it was also mentioned in other books as well but what we have is of course pepper spray capsaicin real capsaicin exactly so I spent time talking about yeah they have the gungeon tivid has cursed you affect people's eyes and we have one that's even by so cover your nose and mouth as well actually cast member from Chili's right and it basically up space and some could be pretty high. We'll have around 2 to 10% of all evil capsaicin but doesn't mean the higher the Mariah actually you want it you know that you want to see what to be really light so that you could penetrate the man so your nose and Ice quicker this is a defense and perhaps offense to act like that to be fast seriously okay you if you have one I have quite a few I don't have one with me but I have pepper spray and actually different you know different concentration of that as well and you could see that until I just basically spend time describing what's capsaicin and how people actually have done a lot of work to even isolated I mean I'm sure at the start of the human time will we know how to eat some sort of a jalapeno wow this thing as spicy science and chemistry figure out what's a compound a compound that it's a molecule that is responsible for this for this feeling right through a lot in relation to analytical chemistry electrochemistry I'm also an analytical chemist because I like to analyze what's in your food or different type of contacts samples I want to know what's in that PS if you have not ever scorched your own eyes or mouth on a hot pepper you may not know that Scoville units measure hotness with the bell pepper being a zero jalapeno going up to 3500 Scoville units habanero which has reduced me to tears rings on average a quarter million Scoville units so what is the wizard a dragon's breath pepper rated at 2.5 million Scoville units nearly doubling the Scoville units of former record-holder puckerbutt Farms Carolina Reaper pepper which itself has sent people to the hospital so track and spread Peppers must be the mughals answer to the conjunctivitis curse yes insofast puckerbutt Farms takes the lead again with odor Smokin Ed Currie cultivating a new not even commercially available pepper X that hits the three million Mark surpassing dragon's breath why does capsaicin hurt so much it triggers the same pain receptors that think you're literally Burning Alive which is why you start sweating also you release endorphins and dopamine so in lieu of a spell that keeps your chipper just pack hot sauce in your bag. How do they know how hot is hot ask a chemist so they compared to you know Ghost Pepper or habanero Rose and you know how long has and all sorts analyze Jose using chromatography to be able to separate and then quantify when they make a mixture of this Chili Pepper they have to offer support digestive stool sample and then they have to clean it up and then injected engine and instrument and then look at separating these different species because the fact is assembled. Was a very complex R I got tons of things in that or you can do that for the Buffalo Wild Wings and that's all analytical chemist I think I'm two years ago maybe even the Costco in analytical chemistry basic Lisa instrumental analysis cost to go or so once you didn't actually study the amount of capsaicin in different types of chillies eating to eat spicy food and also he grew this chili and he wanted to study when the chili pepper that's from home when he process it differently dried in the oven versus other methods will it will it change the amount of capsaicin in it and also his scrotum different environment like a serf different type of soil will it affect the same the same Chilli plant affect the fruits which is his chili Papa's of capsaicin in the show is actually really fun is one of the students in my class who did a project like that kind of hooks people into Chemistry by letting them study things that they already love and in her analytical chem class one student is analyzing what makes Chanel Number 5 perfume smell like Chanel Number 5 perfume and white invitations are the nose knows but the analysis shows I supposed so that's why I analytical chemistry and analytical science is very important and that's why this cause I'm currently teaching the students got to spend half with their semester analyzing things that they're interested in whether it's about you know perfumes for all real vs. imitation so it's this refund 13 12 students excetra each one come up with something that's drastically different another student is testing a different olive oil to see if the amount of antioxidant polyphenols correspond to better taste although they're not allowed to lick anything inside the lab itself now if this episode has taught you anything don't drink a beaker full of a pearl for so many reasons speaking of eating one thing about the Harry Potter series I find challenging is that I end up slowly reading the feast scenes and even though I don't even know what triangle is I'm starving and I'm taking a break to go start putting mix with a splash of coffee creamer toss in some Corn Pops I am a kitchen dragon and my feet less carbs. Rebecca said that one aspect of the course is of course food science starting with none other than the Kaleidoscope of flavors in a bag of jelly beans and yes we got you to have that. I talked about the process of jelly beans are actually made I talked about the process of not only that is that in food science 121 may not be a knot equals to 2 so if you mix a few flavors together you will completely actually tastes a different flavor Jelly Bellies people they know that they know that I think it's everything is top secret very proprietary for example I looked up their process when I talked about jelly beans on my foot chemistry Electra they analyzed for making the pomegranate jelly beans they really analyzed to choose from the real pom pomegranate and they used to use a separation that use a separation techniques such as chromatography that use Mass back to analyze what's in there and they want to know what's a concentration of each of these compounds in the lab into this Jelly Bean so we can see the scientific process to make a flavor that is so close to the real thing it's a lot of luck cuz I know I fell into a deep that your hole and I think this would be otolaryngology that I believe a man by the name of Ambrose Lee Heads Up Jelly Belly flavor science would I like to ask that smart person stupid disgusting questions mean well Rebecca explains add a design you new flavors they will have two people actually eat a hold baby have a bite of the real thing and then chase at bean and then got to be the same so it actually has gone through a very you know I don't really rigorous process in terms of the foot size is amazing I think you to really understand what it was to be created Jelly Bean charge okay here you can see they actually increase you to eat the chocolate and then I think so, she denied the strawberry and become something else if you want to go with a cantaloupe and green apple and that's why I think it's really amazing the cheapest jelly beans you could find out yet if you think about the kind of processing you know these people with creativity that any put it is very amazing and I think I could see creativity I could see using signs in anything I really can't see that that's how why people think how I can correlate just some sci-fi books of Harry Potter books to science is because you can see that just in terms of you look at how much food chemistry and science got into how people think about each type of combination and each of them takes a lot of time to actually develop that being this being and then try out under what conditions you can humans perception of taste works is amazing chew on this some people have more taste buds than others but each taste bud has receptors for salty sweet sour bitter and Umami so that notion that only certain parts of your tongue can taste things that is flim-flam friends that was very Hermione of me I'm sorry and so what do you do in the class a small little bags each one has time to awesome basically to identify without looking at the chart can they even say that this is dr. pepper this is Island lunch what if they could then they have done a great job so that Jelly Belly is in a great job right because that's the ultimate goal right now is to be able to eat that and realize that that speech that's not my goal is quite fun in terms of course I really want you to understand that getting something from an idea to a product it takes a lot of work and a lot of times it will go through a lot of female steps to get to the right to get to the what they want finally and a lot of Sciences involve actually I want to say is it's a simple jelly beans to think about the time that people go into analyzing the Spectre weather is domestic oil the hplc chromatography Battlegrounds day we have to put effort into you you know analyzing that so as to be able to get the product that is so well received. Even though I really dislike some of those flavors excluding those what does so but I don't know how much I like the vomit is pretty bad but some of those two I just I left I left that at the bottom and I just so you'll have to learn yourself some mass spectrometry that measures the mass to charge ratio of ions aplc high-performance liquid chromatography if you don't have a magic wand handy o which left me wondering where does the word come in on with your life because you think about okay do you want to guess what this is of course not but her is Harry's wand wand is a mate from Hollywood the Elder Wand and a different type of elder trees and you we also ended up talking about different types like a willow because Willow is also a long would I believe that is Harry Potter's Mother Lily's wand is made from Willow and then there's other ones such as Lord Voldemort himself original one not the Elder Wand is from you trees and you are the sort of folklore related to Ed but people also study these unique typos on Sand be able to find you again go sorta analytical process to obtain chemicals that you could eventually be used for fighting cancer so all the others a lot of times there's a lot of resources actually doing a lot of research with different type of clients is you try to arrive at least try to understand that right very simple things such as you know methyl salicylate to salicylic acid you think about you know willow bark people use matisoff willow bark back in the days without salicylic acid type of compounds that status Pacific yew tree is used in breast cancer research but that's a Voldemort would yes Voldemort cures cancer what's going on right now it's because it's related to us and things like that use are usually planted in the mythology do you trees are related to death and they planted I'm usually in cemeteries and yeah it's amazing pieces of you birds with a body can protect the song on this journey to the other world is so there's a lot of you know mythology that the or JK Rowling you know she's clearly expert and incorporates thoughts in her books so oh my God. Is the rituals and of course this is what you're talking about but of course but we can get something out of it you know any poisons a lot of things is that you look at it being poisonous is also dose-response try it depends on how much you use basically therapeutic window is very very small so that it is not telling people let's get some you and then she wanted everything how many people trying to really study what's nature nature what nature is offering and then see what one could use to improve human life whether it's about you know what cancer is cancer drugs or not so it's kind of neat to see if that's one of the main part because everyone knows that are exactly that's so fascinating for more on how the Pacific yew treats cancer specifically its Discovery in breast cancer therapies see last October Surgical Oncology episode I promise and leave you hopeful will you cry baby will be worth it back to bronze so these all the one was that you that you wanted was Elder Wand Holly Elm you Vine quotes on Willow walnuts on the first of course these other things that we don't have but at least we can talk about the different one would say so it's all related to the Celtic Tree calendar swells basically Harry's wand is because he was born July 31st and actually matches the Holly and then Hermione was born between September 2nd September 29th and Archie has Vinewood so you can see these are the things that JK Rowling is not random how she chose what type of Wands that the war would she chose for the tree all this week so would you be purged cuz you're a Capricorn yes that is correct I don't know it was also nice so I talked about you see the Holly trees name comes from holy it repels evil achieve astonishing longevity can symbolize both death and Resurrection the sap is also poisonous and that's actually a quote from JK Rowling when people ask why she ended up choosing you for for Voldemort and Holly full for Harry because it comes from holy I was reading about how Professor Dumbledore had an elder wood wand and the conical have for a while and Hermione had fine wood and I a grown woman who hasn't even finished all the box was like oh I need a want I need to carry a polished foot long piece of wood in my purse at all times this is the new me also if you're curious about types of wood and haven't listened to the den knowledge episode I honestly feel bad for you that ologist is amazing so listen to that will you kill time waiting for the second part of this Pieology episode 2 come out next week yes okay tree chemistry and so when you're teaching this in your lectures is there any kind of chemistry that goes into analyzing would a wood is I want to see you but I want to focus more on the chemistry that makes you one thing is that this cause when I first started it like eventually they'll be other professors in the school would be interested in the mughals guide you Harry Potter's plant science I'm a ghost guy to Harry Potter linguistic because all the Spells many of them are latin-based and then you can also have a chemical Sky to Harry Potter as a biology or zoology because you have all these Fantastic Beasts right so I'll do the chemistry portion that have other people do that it would be wonderful if it's within the University of course everyone's busy you can see quite a bit of work to get Siri search and the heart rate to get people to be able to correlate so I was always so I hope that it would be great to have this type of a Synergy to have Nebraska you and I will be Harry Potter related educational courses so you know and things like that because it's a I cannot do all of them I mean I've been talking a bit about Fantastic Beasts looking at it be able to talk about biology and things like that but but linguistic I can't do that I don't think I'm x button pain so either she had no plans here over there because everyone's are the try ask you some questions from listeners but before we ask the smart person you're smart and maybe hopefully at least a few Lewis way stupid questions you're just going to have to wait a week I'm sorry yes this chat was so long I had to divide it into meanwhile you can listen to the dendrology or Surgical Oncology or ferroequinology episodes or you can spend the time reading all the Harry Potter books or watch all the movies or start your own novel next Tuesday it will learn more about her courses and we filled your questions to dr. You can also spend the week saying hi on Twitter or Instagram we are at ologies on both and I'm also on both at Alie Ward Ally with one L and stickers and shirts even some the school inspired merch and backpacks are at ologies merch. Com thank you to Shannon focus and body Dutch or that they are also hosts of The Comedy podcast you are that which is wonderful thank you to you handle with bow and Aaron Talbot for admitting the Facebook group which is full of Wonderful's hello to all the sub redditors out there to assistant editor Jarrett sleeper of the podcast my good bad brain and he whose name shall be spoken Steven Ray Morris who also hosts the parcast and see Jurassic right thank you for editing all these clips together all Harry Potter films are Warner Brothers or to go treat yourself to those films bendjima want to tell your boss you ate bad shrimp route for the week also the theme music for this podcast was written and performed by Nick thorburn of the band Islands which is a very good band so if you stick around till the end of the episode I tell you a secret and this week secret is that I still have not bought a garbage can and also every time I walk in a bookstore or Library I get so excited I immediately have to pee okay next week Pieology part to get stoked technology meteorology sing a song
