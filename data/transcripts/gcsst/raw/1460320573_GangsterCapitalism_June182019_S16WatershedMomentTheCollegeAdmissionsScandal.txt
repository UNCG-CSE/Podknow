should be 14 if plead guilty in of the 17 who plead not guilty most people want them to receive the maximum punishment possible Alan Eisner is a criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles and he has an unpopular opinion these parents shouldn't to time you put people in jail to protect the public but on a crime like this you have people who have no criminal history you have people that didn't wake up that day and say okay how can I commit a crime how can I game the system no they were directed into this system they've been punished substantially by being indicted in this way they've lost their jobs they've lost their dignity if I'm the defense attorney I'm certainly bringing that to the judges attention this is a fall from grace that's irreparable they'll never be able to recover from this and you want to explain that to the judge look at what happened to this person by the mere filing of the indictment their life has been in all terbly changed their relationship with their children has been in all terbly changed this is something that they will try for the rest of their life to recover from and that's without doing any jail time it's the Court's job not to accept automatically the mob mentality of blood are they going to reoffend probably not are the danger to the public probably not have they suffered a loss greater than any jail time could give them certainly not only does Allen think that the parents in this case might avoid jail time he thinks there's a chance that many of those she will go to trial could be found innocent of all charges they were certainly ask to give money but where's the evidence that the parents knew it was going to go to a coaches pocket this is a gift to the school and that's what people do that's a reported back door that's out some people get their kids in school parents can certainly argue in this case that's what their intent was pointed out that the prosecution will argue that the evidence is on almost every one of the 204 pages in the government's criminal affidavit in recorded transcripts from wired shop conversations between singer and his clients that sound incredibly damn it is there a Sephora in 20 some odd years the only way anything can happen is if she won't talk but Allen also explains that the affidavit is a highlight-reel of the most incriminating moments from the recorded conversations and it's not beholden to context her objectivity in other words we're only seeing what the government wants us to see and all of singers exchanges with the parents were designed to indict them as he was coached by the government on what to say okay they asked about your payments one of them for when Mark Rydell took the test for your second daughter okay the payment that we made to help your first daughter get into UCLA through soccer okay and then the payment that we made the donaghy's clips give you part of the story they don't give you the whole story and even when they play the whole transcripts that's still not the whole story Crossing was talking to them without being recorded four months that leaves room for arguing what's not on the tapes what were the conversations beforehand to get the donations that are not on the tapes what advice did he give what manipulation was in place to get them to donate their hundreds of thousands of dollars okay so here's the deal okay we are trying to get ourselves like 34 on the act so anyway the government's going to argue that since they are not disagreeing since they are not objecting since they don't say no that's not what I said no that's not what I understood the government's going to take the position that these parents are adopting the truth of the statement that's made to them what can be challenged in this case simply because you're on the other end of a phone call acknowledging what the other person has to say it doesn't necessarily mean we are agreeing with what he's saying and even if we are agreeing to some of it we're not agreeing to all of it simply because he says remember when we sent this money in and we told you we would get your kid into this particular school and they go off and they're not agreeing that they sent this money as a bribe they believed it to be a donation to the school but that's a long way from a crime Rick Singer is involved in every conversation in the affidavit and so he's the key to making the prosecution's case but according to Allen the same could be said about the defense government's main witness mr. singer he's the center of their conspiracy case the witness like this is fatally flawed I would substantially challenge his credibility in a case like this you want to explain that your clients never done this before your client looked at this guy for advice he's the one who knows how to do it they're going to go the way that he directs them he's the person who has the key to letting them into schools or not they don't know that he's doing anything illegal they don't know that this is not the way it's done they're trusting him you really want to put your client in the position of the passive participant and their lack of knowledge about the system that that's a very important element in the case of good defense attorney brings that up he's the one who knows the coaches the administrators the test-takers the Proctors his scheme only works if he uses the parents with the Deep Pockets do you want to send the parents of victims to his scheme his motive is the traditional fraudster Financial motive you could a guy like that on the witness stand and you can tell the jury how can you trust anything this man says the government is using him to continue his manipulation of these parents you need to reject the evidence emanating from this person if you can dirty up their case I using him that's the way you sway the jury on your side we're all vulnerable dealing with our kids trying to get into college and looking for any way to deal with that you're going to have some people on that jury who think very similar to these parents they have a good chance to convince many jurors that hey I would have done the same thing it's a sentence to Stanford sailing Coach received is any indication what can we expect the other sentences to be will the parents get with so many think they deserve but others raise a bigger question in a case like this where these parents actions even criminal there's a real tendency in general these days for people when they see misconduct kind of move immediately to criminal remedies Randall Eliason is a former assistant us attorney who specialized in white collar crime is a law professor at George Washington University in Washington DC there's a whole lot of bad stuff that happens that should be condemned in is deplorable that isn't necessarily Criminal and we need to think move away from this binary idea that something's either criminal or it's okay and some of the conduct of some of the parents in these cases might fall into that category there are a lot of problems with the way they behaved doesn't necessarily mean that the solution to those problems or to the underlying issues and circumstances that made it possible that the bright remedy remedy and so many is White Collar cases were talking about where do we draw the lines between conduct it's just reprehensible and, if it's actually Criminal cheating on the ACT is a criminal fraud what do I cheating on my Calculus exam in college now by defraud the University you know where do we stop over the past few months so much has been written about this case and everything that's wrong with the culture of getting into college but way before Rick Singer side door blew the lid off of higher education dr. Richard weissbourd was working on finding Solutions I can't really say I'm surprised but I am troubled and the trend line seem to be going the wrong way so you don't think we're going to be hearing that you were these stories but more of these stories dr. weisbord is a senior lecturer at Harvard and the co-author of an extensive report titled turning the tide which took three years to produce and he's leading the charge and trying to transform the college admissions process and reduce the anxiety that it creates with parents and children we're trying to work with parents and some Community saying things like we're not going to get it fit kitchener's before the 9th grade we're all going to Green. To do that we're going to ask the school to insist if it's not take more than 5 AP classes we're going to really create some limits on the amount of stress that our kids are experiencing doctor why sports team is also looking at how technology could play a larger role in the college admissions process College much more into a matching system the dating service basically and people will be matched to colleges that are best for them I think democratizing information given him good information out to people and compelling ways and changing the conversation so it's much more about match and less about what's the most highly-ranked college on all the goals here the reality is and we have dated now that really shows this is that there are hundreds if not thousands of great colleges in the country and their parents were really focused on the question is what is the most high status school or even what is the best goal but what is the best school for my child scored points out that parents and their kids actually have a unique opportunity during the college admissions process something that technology can provide a chance to bond in this country anymore we have very few confirmation to sort of dissipated Barb Obispo County's rituals and a lot of other countries in adolescence where young people are in conversation with adults about what it means to lead a meaningful life what are your Cross Blue Shield Community what's going to be the filling to you and in a way help for many people having too many people that's it and it is incredible time to get to know your kid better to really like help your child begin to what really matters to them and for you to really pause and listen them you know help guide and scaffold their conversation and if you get to know themselves and deeper way you can get to know them in a deeper way you can be a much more useful guide and resource to them if you do know that but that sort of means that you got to abandon your agenda you can't be driven by I want my ticket my kid into these colleges you really got to enter this process a different way and think about how can I get in this process in a way that feeling again let me get to know my child more deeply which is a wonderful thing right dr. Weiss board concluded his report saying at some point technology might radically reform the college admissions system or young people themselves myrabelle against the parts of the system that creates stress and are unfair but he says wouldn't it be better if we as parents and Educators took action first Tim channeling all of his energy that would have been channeled into my personal career out by the Home into the home and my children on the beneficiaries of that type of driven energy that's Cassie a mother of two living in an affluent suburb in Michigan Cassie's a graduate of Brown University and then got her law degree at a top-tier school she worked as an attorney for 6 years and then chose to be a stay-at-home mom and Cassie says all of the type a drive that she had put into her own career was now squarely put towards making sure her children were successful students I think one of the reasons the major leagues in a person works is for validation and a way of stay-at-home mother might be validated is how well their child does what is an external way of gauging the job you're doing it won't be in the raises for the promotion to the big bonus at the end of the year but it will be in how the child excels in sports or music or the end of year Awards and so something that reflection is such a positive reflection and something that I think a lot of us would be speaking because they're so little of it it's very delayed validation really the end of your life you can look back and say oh here she grew up to be a really lovely person so I feel good about that but in the day-to-day process that year after year what other way can you get the job you're doing that's why I how well society says they're doing when the kids get their acceptances and sweatshirt where the school I don't know what they call it you know sweatshirt day or college day and and the kids wear them that's saying we set a goal and we reached our goal and I get that I'm saying we an hour I think many of us feel that it is a joint effort we did this yes you know I often hear parents say we got it as if they're going as well and that by the parent has the sweatshirt as well those are sharing look at what we've achieved in the last 17 18 years of parenting and so there's so few ways you can tell the world what a good job you've been doing that instead of going out starting a company you've decided your Foster your child to Greatness and it is a direct reflection on you at least for me for sure how many of us have dedicated our day today to their well-being and nothing else frankly so in that sweater day, the children are proud but the parents are Kendall prouder can I see 16 year old son Bennett goes to one of the top Independent high schools in Michigan here he describes his daily schedule wake up at 6:30 shower get ready for school go to school by 8 I have six classes and free. And lunch but I'll skip lunch to study for whatever quiz I have that day and treasure. I'll probably meet with a t-shirt after school 3:45 I have to go to rowing practice on the varsity roller so we're out there from 3:45 to 7 I get back around 7 have dinner then I will have a model un meeting from 7:30 to 8:30 get home around 9 and then I have 3 hours of homework till 12 if I want to I'm not feeling super confident out something I'll study till even after that then I'll be in bed by 1:30 schools don't really think about the stress on the kids because ultimately I think parents see College admissions as a really big deal first and foremost and then that's what parents value in the high school they send their kids to because that's the most quantifiable way of measuring success that you could see if you're looking at different high schools when a class has a lot of crap going to Ivy Leagues are really recognizable schools at least they put that pressure there then you really strive for that and it can really affect how the graduating class end up looking at the expense of stressing out and I think that ends up hurting the mental health of the kids in the school I've been thinking for years about my son's college strategy so I'm sitting there thinking what would set him apart how can he perform at Carnegie Hall or where does it start the orphanage and where does he start it and all these crazy ideas and a freshman my friend and I we have to think God and we shared it with each other which was that when we saw our child freshman first semester report card and I wish that okay it's over like you know you see that first being you're done we're all done no matter math is going to fix that and again he has it cure cancer the way it holds he is no sort of Prodigy that I like I responsible for that are really really high going into defrost in my class I would say maybe fifty to sixty percent of kids are medicated or dealing with a mental health issue in some way and then maybe an even bigger number than that are dealing with something and don't even know about it or don't even try to address the genetic way Hope College admission thing seems like the cheek of everything you've worked for in your career as a student and it seems like we need to do badly on a Chester you don't do as well like I said you wanted to he can feel like the end of the world there was a kid in my grade who was Captain of the robotics team he had a great internship lined up 36 act over Ford 4.0 GPA and a bunch of AP classes captain of the China skin and pretty well liked by everybody and I think he must have been dealing with the stress of everything she was keeping up and trying to keep all those numbers great for college admissions and he ended up taking his own life this kid was a superstar he excelled at every single thing he tried and this person going to be on the cusp of Conquering the world and yet he's no longer with us and it makes every parent evaluate what is the craziness bought into and what is it for why why do we do it there was a conversation between me and my parents answer came to the agreement tide the pressure coming from inside the house isn't going to make a difference as to the numbers that come back so they just decided to become more supportive and encourage me to do my best and encourage good grade still but not sort of place getting into a top school or getting into a recognizable school as the most important thing and the most important thing. I'm trying my best and I am sort of I guess saying so many things have to change high schools have to look at the parents and say look around almost none of your kids are going to get into an ivy will just tell us that flat-out just accept it learn to live with it now so that you can think of your own plan B they don't say that at all even though we know it we need to know it we should know it they definitely know it it just seems really fruitless I have a 90-degree I'm idle call my beautifully framed and it's it's dusty and my basement a while I thought if I or we just had to Fletcher I would have made this time so worthwhile but I mean I don't know I hope my kid is crying and funny and I hope you continue to do all the things that you can't Gauge by his test scores or the sweatshirt he'll be wearing next year because life is and there's just so much more than getting into a top-rated College an earlier episode we describe the college admissions Scandal as a watershed moment in higher education there was agreement that things have come to a head and that they needed to be changed we were all outraged Rick Singer entitled and Status hungry parents gaming the system every step of the way all of it provoked anger resentment and created a forum for people to vent about everything that's wrong with college it certainly got all of us talking but watershed moments are markers of change and in this story the one thing I keep asking myself is who's going to change this process and if we don't change it it's pretty clear that this won't be the end of the story just the beginning since episode 1 we've provided a tip line and email address for you to let us know about any additional information as it pertains to Rick Singer scheme or others that were unaware of and we've been inundated with listeners reaching out informing us of more people scamming the system I have a tip about my former private high school and she doing I went to high school and our valedictorian for my your cheated on most upper entrance and final AP class exam as several other about their students and the guidance counselors help them do it does a pretty open secret that the administration did this or 88% of our class went to the University of Michigan or Ivy League school affluent lots of money from Los Angeles his son's somehow got into Stanford as a swimmer but the sun was in a swimmer I realized that right around the time the government was doing this investigation in October of 2018 the son decided not to go to Stanford and transferred are so please look into this it was an interesting situation for a student I knew joining rowing team in Texas dad and mom were cfo's for different major companies in Texas I casually asked her if she was a real she said she had never been in trouble before after she got into the school she got injured just like seeing her students a coach has set it all up it could have been the only one he got in I feel weird and uncomfortable reaching out I thought about doing it ages ago but didn't have the. I had a sense that an old back made of mine spearing business with Shady all of my friends from back to me that he can get literally anyone into a good school and prefers to take on only the worst cases like it's a sport is like Rick Singer I guess that's the thing about white collar crime if there's an Antiquated system in place somebody's out there right now gaming it thank you for listening to season 1 of gangster capitalism as this chapter of the College admission Scandal continue sunfold we will keep our tip lines open and closed sleep track how the story develops we will also soon be announcing more information on season 2 of gangster capitalism so stay close and please keep feedback coming gangster capitalism is a production of c-13 Originals it's written and directed by me Andrew Jenks and Zack Leavitt executive produced by me Chris Corcoran and Zack Love It produced by Lloyd Lockridge Perry Crowell and Terrence malagon editing by Perry Crowell and Zack Lovett mixing and mastering by Bill Schultz or work in design is by Craig Courtney original score is by Joel Goodman and a theme song is your sins will find you out by Eli Paperboy Reed special thanks to Chris Flannery Serena Regan Stacy Whitmire Kristoff Broder Debbie demontreux David Jacoby Sage Milgram and Chase camping for more information go to Gangstar capitalism.com and follow us on Instagram at gangster capitalism or on Twitter at gangster Capital you can always follow me on Twitter and Instagram at Andrew Jenks
