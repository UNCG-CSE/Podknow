when I was younger I I waited tables like every actor and Christian are both are actually work in the same coffee shop and I kind of fantasize about going back to those days and play with the idea of being an Uber driver are there certain jobs and I'm like please be an Uber driver going to 10 years ago maybe I was in New York with some friends and we have one of those dinners that had just kind of petered out and I had sort of lost interest and I was maybe be affected by certain things that I put in my body I went over to another table cuz I always fantasize about this and I just busted I just started clearing their plates and I took him to the kitchen and the people at the table that I cleared we had zero idea that I didn't work there by the end of the people in the kitchen with no longer laughing they were like you have another table to clear like hurry up and bust at their table and I was fully just working there so you should have done like a dramatic quitting you should have like dropped a tray of place me like thatcan't do this anymore I quit my apron down you listen to life is short I am your boy Justin Long and speaking of boys that with me some ways is my brother Christian was not there that night nor was he ever a busboy per se but I did work at the coffee shop I was a boy and I and I bus tables actually so now I guess I wasn't as a barback yeah that's it exactly I was a busboy if Barbara busboy for a bar your eyebrow just because you couldn't say that I want everyone to know that I was also talking about my cool guy face recently and I thought about you. I will get to that out there that night but I've I've heard James was there or just telling it just now like it's not a story like I feel like I'm bragging about it but I haven't talked about what you're just like it relates to get to write relates to Our Guest today but I don't off until it's not really much of a story is just like a fun thing for me to have done I would imagine that people hearing that story would think of it as though he just loves a novelty exactly to do that but I'm here to tell you guys that even though I wasn't there I know you well enough to know that you genuinely enjoyed doing it and got into it and like the interaction with the customers and it wasn't like oh I'm going to do some like silly things got attention or something I really believe that you would maybe want to be an Uber driver Now call and yeah everything about her stories everything about it strike you respond like you can also just getting paid for your time driving around I'd like to drive around I like I like meeting strangers I also think it's fair to say you are pretty unqualified at that point in your life to be a busser which is why you got in trouble by Nutrilite it went from being like a fun large for everybody to like didn't know who this guy is coming what's the point we're like okay now he's working here right and he kind of sucks do you know who else is unqualified Our Guest today yeah yeah she's so unqualified that she has a show is coming back for it wait for fans of it like myself called unqualified it's some one of the first podcast I was introduced to and hosted by my very very dear friend Anna Faris and Anna she was doing this show and I want to first times I even heard that term podcast podcast what is a podcast and I just I don't know I don't know what I thought at the time of it was just it was a funny excuse to like to hang out with Donna who's my friend who I don't get to see enough and talking to my friend for however long that sounds great and it was if I was so taken by at that here we are did you meet her doing waiting know I'd you never before that I met the night we both landed we were the first two actors in that movie reminder first few who landed in New Orleans we got there a day early and so I met her in New Orleans and we my first night with her we went out and just crawled around the bars of Bourbon Street and just explored Bourbon Street I don't think either of us neither of us have been there and and so that was my introduction to Anna and it's always kind of and it's appropriate I mean we still have so much fun together but that's how I was introduced to her down Bourbon Street it going out drinking hanging out just the two of us Strangers Like immediately hit it off you work with the Run, show that she is the very very popular show that she is the star of currently you didn't upset of it. Number of years ago and I just went back to where we were they shot that. At least favorite Lots on Warner Brothers right next to the Big Bang Theory when I went back there when I went back there to do actually honest podcast so I'm a couple weeks ago couple days before she did ours and such a fun environment it's it's what I always imagined Hollywood was like you know with the gold Hollywood backlots and you people riding around on the cards and all these characters people dressed up with these adults smoking but dressed up as like you children children's characters are yeah I know I know but like or like being a Roman gladiators and there's an alien in and they were shooting cuz there was a shooting Space Jam 2 omigod in and out on a really wanted to see she's like I heard LeBron LeBron LeBron I think so that this was a big scoop I wasn't fighting sign anything so but he was there and she said she and I was like I feel uncomfortable would he say that he was in a room with all those people he knows and is like Entourage and she went in there and walked right in and I can bring myself I had to go to I know he'd be great on the show but she was great too and you'll get into it definitely is more in her she took control at some point of this and it does because I want to blame it on her I like it I like the direction to goes in but this one is definitely different than if your if you have kids around yeah I would say definitely put some into

virginity your urethra would suddenly have terrible aim that is in a teenage brain that kind of makes sense if your cat peeing on the Sea Catholic now sex is for marriage so don't we didn't talk a lot about sex with a made it very taboo I would say so and we would all kind of tease each other about girls and stuff fight I remember once being in the car with my my dad was driving my older brother and I and I wish I was in the back seat and he was like halfway through the talk about the birds and the bees before I realize that's what it was I just remember him saying he was very kind of like clinical about my dad's a philosophy Professor so he's that use a real like it that make it hurt when a man enters a woman's love you didn't start out what he knows he's the best router like your technical about sex I don't know how does he reconcile himself with the idea for the philosophy and religion it's all that's pretty funny it's cool but it was all Martin Luther stuff that's later that's more like Luther Unit protestantism this is like he believed that Catholicism was like a form of like political control or like it in the sense that you're back then as medieval days yes he is a great amount of respect for it for it for the church but also understand that it is like a human system and in humans are flawed and he's quite pragmatic about it that back then yes of course he recognizes how old that the doctor all the darkness of how do you feel now are you getting are you getting up to the golden gates I would love to I don't know if I believe in that yeah yeah I know my parents are probably even listen to this and I by no means any guys Wendy real story about Jack but yeah they're awesome but but I grew up with is the end my dad's my brother's a fourth-generation sociology the group in like within this one's Academia world will smile rodent my thing was that my parents were atheist but they really wanted me to be a virgin until I married her it was like that was one other my mom had a lot of like she grew up pretty poor and beautiful she had like these fuk up. there were a few traumatic things that happened in because my parents didn't have logic behind the idea of me being a surgeon and that they would have accepted it if it was really just a religion based necessarily but but it did make me feel like it took me until I was I don't know like 36 to reconcile my guilt with sexuality like I yeah I am so forbidden it was like worse than Drugs That's so interesting yeah did you ever ask them did you ever confront them about what is it about me once I just see what I have never been promiscuous but which is actually a term that I fucking hate now that I think about it yeah it's so judgmental as applied to Men actually no shame and guilt attached to sex for me even at like a mile day when I was young and I didn't lose my virginity until I was 18 and I remember how old you were most of your friends have missed your friends at least said they did and I remember talking about it you know what were the guys in high school and I remember being somewhat embarrassed that I couldn't fully participate in probably even lying at some point like like I was more experience than I was off and I remember having a shame about it so I would say I remember being in a group of kids movie eighth grade ninth grade right when it was like I was at the height of stiff breeze would blow by an experienced this when they were teenagers we were talking about how they hit their sexual peak we hit our sexual peak much way to work therefore we know what to do with it I remember the feeling of having such intense we work this all out okay search boners that was so powerful right hurts almost and I can't right yeah yeah yeah as you're saying that it it's like this thing is happening to your body and its legs maybe that's even as I said no tell me when you're going to be fine with this they understood I hope you did it at least three times quite the same I think that once you kind of do for me at least it was like once you kind of discover cuz at least I didn't I didn't talk about sex with her friends but I also wasn't having sex I didn't have any friends that would be a challenge navigate especially with women like the like the female Waters I don't know how to I felt like I was too intense I was too self-congratulatory drive yourself I was just so excited I'm so passionate but but like do you still feel that Hollywood and I think it's true Hollywood High School in and being a being in this business is a version of just like a heightened kind of Republic version of high school do you do feel remnants of that of that High School honor now I think I'm much more gregarious because your people seem to like you know like laugh at the stupid shit that I saved just because they really blond hair or whatever but I would describe it a little bit more like his Fame and success it sort of intensifies a part of your personality it sharpens either something that is that is a negative or positive such as how is it sharpened in a positive way you your personality happier I was so mad that I was a girl so mad so what if you were in high school group would you describe the crowd as butt and I was you know in the drama club and they call the sabacc cavers spending be like you were a couple kids were capes and Katie had like vampire fangs but at that time at that time Fame was not something that you over at least saw it like I mean like you would never tell somebody that you want to be famous it's hard for me to wash my face during phases hard for me to listen to my voice that oh didn't you tell me that movie this story and then when I did Mom Who TARDIS on the show I was doing mom I was doing on the show and it's the first season was 6 years ago I was doing yoga and you and was a new thing for you to do a multi-camera show and you were talking about the some of the challenges that you were facing with this new medium and end a different style of acting and thought you had told me a story about it was it was an actor in there like 60s or 70s hit one of those sitcom actors who if not it wasn't Don Knotts no oh my God memories in our friendship you told me that you you were shooting something and like there was like some old dude and I told her to ask her if I have no idea I don't know 80 in my memory and you really pays them like I was your day and you said did Alma phases the same story really it's just a warped and it was in the context of the doing that about of being paranoid that you were just making faces so it's to the listeners if this isn't to inside re the reason this is such a big fear is that as an actor you need to inhabit another person you you become another person and hopefully a three-dimensional is that like you just did this other person so to say to to to to hide behind just making faces it did sort of like a it cheapens but you know but I can take a lot of factors that would do that yeah just make faces a lot of them just make one face on your end there's job on my end as a woman is more like glances and glares I just realize what you meant by jaw clench jaw clenching the jaw clench we've all seen it myself or face I had told him your face do to me or my brother is so embarrassing it's like it's like a person I love you know I mean girlfriend but now very close friend and she does this kind of thing this kind of like sultry I'm impressing my lips my brother hang out every once in awhile to call me out if I'm in the pretty girls around he'll still accuse me of having like a brother that like like kind of like a wounded or like I'm really make eye contact with anybody cuz like I noticed you've been so good at reading and her focusing the conversation you think you've got better where you always say I don't love small tacos in any way you want to be like you know I'm like oh so you're married or wait so wait what's going on I like the best of qualities I led to put you in touch with dangerous if you like it then you might enjoy the phone when we were doing waiting in New Orleans on Elmwood this is where we got to know each other and we just kind of like take off and in the neck hey if you would end up at a pool party with some teenagers that sounds inappropriate but like not an idiot take it that it is I don't think maybe I don't know. I don't get cell phone and she call hours later and she ended up at the supermarket in should we just meet people. Louis and Debbie that Louis and every night right fuck France until 11 that behavior during that time I was engaged to my first husband and I was really I must have been hindsight's 20/20 memory sharpens itself I'm but I must have been not sure about the engagement in this impending marriage clearly because I viewed like waiting for me during that movie felt like this is like a study abroad I get to Lake just do whatever the fuck I want you seemed ready to spread your wings and there's no better. We like winter Bourbon Street and just really did it first I was like this is going to be a long suit sauna and myself at Kaitlin Doubleday and Rob Benedict the four of us were kind of a little click but in that movie there were so many actors are age and Ryan Reynolds and I was just having I was fucked up I was exploring like my life I was about to get married and I think deep down inside I knew that I did that probably was not like not the best, worst year find my high school boyfriend ever tell you about that part I almost just didn't realize I was at almost a real spit take as she was in another putting water in my mouth that was almost nothing better than a you called you're probably one of the nights I stayed in so well when we really fucking hit it off and does he send me that you really got along with not connecting with somebody they were but I was kind of scared order like nerves are on edge you were around him you behaved a bit differently which was really heartbreaking to see because you're so glad you know you're somebody that I really liked and I was like that sucks to put up put it I see that with some friends you know when they're with somebody that kind of dampens them a little bitter or puts like and then in you you don't seem like that now and you I saw you with your current lover and you seem that which is nice to see your love her even with her former lovers I've seen you yourself we can I turn his back on to you are you dating with no no I'm not taking a lover know I mean it now I'm taking taking time for me to come because you're really handsome do this thing that's right you do this thing where you take because you're like the secret underground player this is your thing with me this is not true that is so true underground that I see what that implies to me is that I get more women than I should I do think that you respect and like women did you do in a different way than sleazy guys in Hollywood but here's that cab yet I think it's just a lot of women in Hollywood when you dump them is that what you asked me the other day how many of those relationships ended that month with my doing yeah but I don't think I think it's pretty even maybe skewed look back at those relations and then like it I'm glad somebody made a move because we weren't meant to be you know for sure but it's a quality I would never like that's what I would never want you to change yourself with that feels like that's nice but I love you for this but I am but I do think that so many guys have an obvious slickness them that you don't because you are like you're honest and straightforward try to pin your and you're interested in people and you like intimacy you like relationships I think and then so then when you break up with somebody there like one of your world I think also I go in way too fast way too hard and this is something that this is I never I'm very difficult for me to be in through somebody that I'm not in the sounds like music bullshit but that I haven't really connected to another profession what would it be I would I love to draw I would probably do something in the drawing will you tell me something this is I like to draw faces of old faces and I love drawing old like overweight faces all men usually time for me to draw women you going to do what do you call boobs I don't know speak is to the weather like in different contexts sweetie take some if liquor with a lover lover would be comfortable I guess I never heard like you're really gonna know your willy that's a tough one to be so it's like the whole idea of wipes her own ass and historically has the queen had somebody to do that for my only does she not have to wipe your own ass someone bleaches her ass kids around for black yeah why would you

shortly to yoyogi in the morning your face is back and this should not be an important detail but I feel like the societal pressure to make this a detail that I was wearing jeans and a t-shirt and a backpack and this car drives by and they like these dudes yell out like show us your tits but in the New Zealand accent and then drove by and said something like that like we want to suck your pussy or something like that but I can handle it anyway I recounted the story because it was the only one I had on the George Lopez show this very short-lived George Lopez Show and then I got a letter from the minister of Tourism so then if you can watch I had to apologize like a bunch of feminist getting your right like New Zealand dudes are dicks and I'm like what I got I don't even know the Willies New Zealand and then now is incident then I wrote a letter to like the new Auckland X whatever I'm saying like I am very you like I apologize you've amazing how to delete it was so silly they felt

number for the marketing different for a lady you have to put a tampon and it's a really all right here that I have to work sucks really uncomfortable it's a it's a flesh colored and it's always are you uncomfortable or do you order can I get off on it no because here's why because it's very unflattering because it's a tiny piece of material to the point where you think not that I don't think I'm going to fit in that you know and then it and then it's can I sex all your stuff is made of a material that kind of like six of your stuff together so it's a very unflattering little ball little ball of Johnny email junk if you could be one age for the rest of your life physically what would it be do you have a lot of things I can do with Jesse Eisenberg he said 85 I think you feel sometimes that hard like an older I don't really mean it on because it's like the trains last station I was like well what happened to fight so much it's a potentially loaded in like a kid if you could be an animal what would it be he didn't even goes towards the carnivore right like like a tiger or lion or eagle or whatever, but do we value them check over lately do I pick my coral a clam join Clan back to the house or like just depends like how interesting is my life I get to just live for like five hundred years ago by other day I said that I have a feeling that was to just watch Life go by I might like that I might like to be cool or a giant clams live for hundreds of years oh oh oh that is cool why would you do that you do this to everything sorry and you got to go alright nevermind what if I become friends someday with Paul McCartney and and he's resentful because he listened to your podcast probably goes blurry middle time time time of what a great note and on and fuck you I love you I love you son hey everyone please listen to Justin Long's Say It Ain't So podcast and some people just heard wow that really happened it sure did how many people did we lose I am the one real problem with it is I just wish you guys had talked about genitals more it just was almost enough but it never for me for me personally and never quite got there a really I wonder if it broke some podcasting record has probably been around for that long as I'm not I hope that's not Eric I'm sure they're podcast that talk about you and it was a lot more are there like I'm sure they're like genital themed podcast there's 655 guys it's true oh my God what are you talkin arrogance I just displayed yeah I was pretty listening to it it's funny like being in it when I was doing it it felt so natural and easy and funny when she's just I want my I hope that part is clear listen back and I was like what the fuc it's like she's so hot she's just so random and she says things out of the blue and that's why it's hard to have a conversation because you had this little we talk about our little league group called we called ourselves to CiCi's because we would I don't think you mentioned if we consistently go to the same bar called The Cajun cabin for whatever reason we go there all the time and one time Donna we both jumped into this Jug Band where they have them you know they play like the what's that washboard so and they were like oh yeah come on in played in this Jug Band with somebody play the spoons and they're really into like having other people participate and then a bunch of bar patrons anyway to CiCi's and send that night or later on I don't know where we would just print out into this British accent like an old Queen then she was like I declare you the president of the CC that you just like playful weirdly playful that's why she would befriend like twins that's a good name for her autobiography weirdly playful yeah it's funny that you say that about all your bar experience because listening to it this specifically felt like I'm at a bar with you guys are you guys doing you know ate too much adderal it was like a very bar conversation Ribble Reibold old is it must be a better well I haven't thought about working like hopefully somebody will write me on shaming letter about a Canadian Christianity Alright by Britney t it was very hard stool is hard for me to believe that she didn't have many friends in high school and talks about that by now because it seems like she would be so easy to be friends with them she not only is she very outgoing the little little I know her but she's also approachable but that may be like you know when we talked about this a lot of memory how memories is Turkey in the EU create different memories with this actually relates to we have to obviously that moment where I cannot remember that story like and I did all my faces which I think is a very important story from yeah I did my face is story it's all I've heard you tell that story to me before about her so I at least in your memory it's been cemented she did say this drink I wonder do you wish there was a way to get the truth out a yeah I will say she has in my opinion a great podcast voice your voice sort of Smokey and sexy but also kind of cute and accessible and open as weird as a weird combination of like it's kind of see how you're working at made gross but also kind of young yeah it's pretty good voice for all the random like to do tangents and like The Improv out of nowhere she's also very she's very smart and redirecting and if she doesn't in like a traditionally interview responsible way she's able to redirect it back on track where you at here's what you were saying just did it to me a couple times you said she's really very smart it's almost like that quote unquote random stuff is in as random as we think it is I can't believe I said that the worst part is that you for all you do do this you have the sort of like handsome squinty face when you're trying to present your best Luke oh my God I like that's so embarrassing most embarrassing part of that you compare it to James Dean which it does not look like James Dean hold on hold on I obviously don't think my facial structure it is in any way comprable the only way I meant it is that my friend Max minghella cause a laser face heard back say but we're there likes their their squinting and they're so kind of like focused on something but in like a far-off place they're like looking in the distance cool all really happy at all handsome guys have that potential but you do the thing where you like to punch you in the eye could see your you like you later jaw so when I say James Dean it's only like I'm a spy. That's the like platonic form yes I did it is possible Sonic Farm yeah it's embarrassing she is so I was so struck by how honest she is and how candid about things that are even potentially America think there is honest she's she's just such an open book at and and I think that my fearlessness really creates a fertile podcast environment you know it doesn't she does not on the show she know she sometimes sometimes too honest you know I would say but it's it's good to err on the side of a podcast can't do that I had a heart touching my sexual sounds still but I don't know if it's Catholic hang ups or I don't run like you getting boners it in like in an easy way when you're 14 years old and I think is funny enough and not gross enough to talk it out and I think so I don't know where my phone is so I'm more kind of like sensitive to talk to you about something. It's also funny word boner and take it to do is believe that there was a character on network TV the owner is used as like you made a move to be like yeah that's right like you made a real boner boner on head is different you guys talk about the queen getting her ass hole bleached and I if you were anyone listening is curious about my opinion about that I would say I think Anna is wrong I don't think the queen this raso bleach because it would be one thing if the queen had to look at her asshole and she want everything to be no perfect and sparkling but why would the queen care about that I've done the same thing and she I think sometimes it takes a very concrete position on something that she hasn't totally but then she thinks through it and you can have time to get both deflect compliments in a very similar way like you both don't like to say, I'd rather not here then I could have done without the Improv scenes yeah also because she doesn't get to play that on Mom it's like her wanting to do that cuz that's what she sewed right part of her I think that's where a lot of that comes from of course you book at did the interview with more General chat it was started and finished with some genital talk and I tried saying one do you know which one I regret yeah Herberger oh no not that there was something else you said yeah that's just the one that jumped out to me let us read a letter like we do after all this just redirect pivot okay this is from Allison are hello I recently started listen to podcast and absolutely love it when she cut out the like come on it's good to hear that people like to have that she loves it that's awesome thank you your stories are always entertaining even when you were plugging your ads anyway I'm emailing you guys to tell you a story of my senior year of high school I graduated high school in 2006 during that year I was waiting for any acceptance letter to any of the colleges in which I'd apply well I had not done any acceptance letters yet I had a few rejection so I was getting a little discouraged one day I received a phone call from my dad who is ecstatic I received an acceptance envelope from the South Harmon Institute of Technology I told him I didn't apply there I've never even heard of that school I came home and had to break it to him that this was advertising for a new Justin long movie that side oh my God this memory always makes me look back and laugh I ended up going to Indiana University so all is not lost any way whoever did your mark exam movie did a great job well thank you I but I would argue that maybe not a bit maybe like too great a job like that it's really funny the Port or Port the head must he was ecstatic and you must hate you you had a shity fake out South Harmon Institute of Technology Windows say I'm a shithead cuz that there was the acronym you know what's funny about that is I know you're going to say that so Christian was actually in that movie and he so that some of the South Harmon Institute of Technology for those of you who haven't seen it I'd create this fake school I played this kid who didn't get into college and the acronym the letters were sshit South Harmon's haha it's so and we were in the ones that's cool heads and them are mascot was with a shit sandwich Christmas just waited did you just say I was just asking a guy who got their hands on that Raw Christine that was played Saturday was all set heating to deal to play so one day he was in I walked into the make of their make a trailer and was so fun it's so funny to see and I I see him in getting his makeup out of there just painting his face around which I didn't occur to me at the time how old can a problematic that is yeah but not for the reasons that it says what he was getting it painted brown so that he could be in this shit sandwich with egg sandwich and I all I had to do in the movie Eye to walk by Justin's character and say hi to him and that's it I'm never being involved shot for that especially for that size of a movie that was it was like a Steadicam which means like a guy had to carry this big Tempe camera that would bring the cameras RAV4 back then and he at the Walk of it was I think he was following me walking into this campus that we had set up just like school that we had set up so it was too caught a Steadicam tracking I told you they were following me and it was kind of involved and Christian music the moving piece of that we had a heat after like here tomorrow I can go put the plans we didn't mean to do it a lot and it was outside.
