welcome to the weekend edition of the Undisputed podcast on your host Jenny Taft today's podcast features all the best segments from this week's slate of Undisputed with in-depth interviews and discussions we have a lot to talk about heading into next week skip Shannon let's get to it the Cowboys had no problem opening up the season with a 35-17 win against the NFC East rival and Giants as he ended up with 53 yards in a touchdown but the day was all about Dak Prescott Dak had over 400 passing yards for touchdowns any perfect passer rating all while he continues to negotiate for contract extension that Jerry Jones said after the game was quotes Eminence for now joined by Fox Sports NFL analyst Michael Vick good morning good morning will he be a top 10 quarterback by the end of the season of top five quarterbackstalk and you know I'll just I'll just lay out the rest of the show do it once you can do it again and indac is done it over and over and over again and with immense amount of pressure Week 1 contrac hang in the balance to go out there and be that accurate that efficient the ball distribution was on display he look like he was in the top five right now but look the ceiling is half a deck and he's going to continue to get better and you know what the coaching staff around them and you know year for this year for correct knowing that that probably has no the ultimate amount of input where he can you know pretty much put a game plan together himself you not think him and Jason Dragon sit down and talk about what really works and you know when you get to that point it makes the game really easy for you in and I think the biggest caveat is Ezekiel Elliott being on the field you know I mean to deep defense is was just getting exploiting mean just getting you know it was going to expose yesterday I mean off the play-action and that's the that's the reason for having to seek their that's his impact that he has when he's when he's on the feeling I think if they're only going to get better it's just Week 1 and I want to get spayed he's really going to be motivated so I'm excited to watch this Dallas Cowboys team you know throughout the duration this season and I will say this as of right now into the playoffs are very talented think homeboy breeds Rodger walk into a river has a DJ DJ got it baby back rib barbecue I ever had no good well you don't have barbecue better than ever. Just do barbecue you about right now and so what you just saw yesterday you saw that 400-yard 25 completion Giant Eagle, one person they can let go of defense last year was the worst defense in the NFC east and they lose Olivier born and they lose the land in college so how do they get better and you play it, too because you want to stop the run so you don't want me to get off when you you got Ogletree stepping up bro you got do that you got the whole why you worried about the wrong the B-52 I can come down here but in this defense right here I got whole responsibility he taking the play fake Randall car right behind the table play fake right behind stop this one thing you call the term for another moment. That's what you become you become the very thing that you asked people not to do what you did you call the term Fresno yes you did and what you asked people not to do Skip Bayless is come to bury thing he eaten the most in the person see something oh that's the best thing I've ever seen before you go do it the Cowboys didn't make this a nip tuck ball games has better football team than the Giant and it was on display but you get you go overboard then you got to got to do I need to call Blair buswell he's the guy to make the bus for the Hall of Fame my turn I want to explain to those out there who might have forgotten this man could really play quarterback he he gave me some of the most as a fans on the most electrifying moments I've ever had on my couch the Michael Vick experience Atlanta and the First full display the first year in Philadelphia it was there was some that won Monday night game so this guy's been there and done all that and he knows how hard it is to play quarterback in this league only reason I say what I say that is correct this young man was a tour-de-force yesterday he showed you coming of age but I've been telling you this since last year because here's the point statistically over the last 10 games last year he was a top five quarterback already and you kept saying no no no and I kept saying the stats are screaming yes yes yes once he got Amari Cooper he took off and all the sudden he's got Beyond Amari Cooper because Michael Gallup has has much he's come of age you could just see it on full display yesterday he has a bona fide legitimate number to receiver who can get behind Peru and I told you all offseason Randall Cobb is an upgrade over Cole Beasley and I love Cole Beasley and he's he's great and little zing zing Ralph little in-and-out little 5/73 and 5 games but Randall Cobb can run past people we saw it on not year ago when he caught the winning touchdown pass for Aaron Rodgers biology Luffy Luffy looks healthy because he can run and you can do things with them out of the slot that make you he's he's like a sore butt to a receiver he's like maybe another number to kind of receiver now you have weapons that over the final six or seven games when was Zeke was out in 2017. Can't nobody that he trusted and loved and last year and tell him or he came he had nobody he trusted in love then he takes off and over the last 10 games and you will not acknowledge this or embrace it he led the NFL in completions he led the NFL in postseason qbr he was tremendous in both the two playoff games but you won't buy are you in because your dog in and you're just going to have to sit over there and eat crow and Carlisle Pew like your Crow what what do you like on It BBQ sauce realbignik I've been talkin big since last year they went into down the stretch because of Miami 2 weeks do just gave up 59 but I see it's tough when you play walking tour will you play the Patriots that's the last year they walked it right to him last year twice the second quarterback in the two fourth quarters against Philly last year and one overtime he threw for 3:31. Just a lot of yards for a touchdown reception 2428 he just put on on just displays of dire wolves but he's not hurt and he got DJ and DJ to take the top off Eli was doing the Lattimore and Fowler Latimer and Fowler that the Broncos way but the Jack Alshon in the Earth both teams and primed and ready for each other in 2017 when it was really tough you know what he didn't have weapons he and he didn't have Z and you didn't have Z and he didn't have it still didn't look as bad he still looked like he had potential to be what he look like yesterday and then you can get him one give him a number one receiver you continue to build on the offensive line green Zeke back and he shows his full potential I look at potential and I look at the opportunities is going to come about down the road where he he'll be put on the biggest stage and I just think he can handle it right now man I mean it's just that I don't care if he was playing a college degree what you do you catch it take it to the market yet so they had a fish on the line you know might be the bomb he threw the gallop on the left side the one that drop in the bucket to be be able to print weapon what about the BB can you get closer to clear a jar with v stop it I'm not throw the drop in the bucket go to play that tape against Jupiter and get blasted get hit twice and the receiver Half Dome going to be two yards of are open. Great way 86 get it that easy easy easy I'll come back I'll come back. play caller that he's tight with it that tell him or that they're they're like so much they're very close and all the sudden you could see him going to the sideline you know just high-five and Wiccan hugging with Jerry was happy to have you if you did not do so many three and four hundred yard games you got in three and a half years and look like you picked up where you left off last year I saw you can watch the Cowboys game by game for Game 5 you see the music okay cycle Vegas Antonio Brown's at tenure with the Raiders is officially over a Navy is already working with Tom Brady to get the speed with his new team New England out of this week's game against the Dolphins in an interview yesterday Brady had high praise for his new teammate but made sure the focus was still on getting to work take a listen football player knows how to play the game he's been extremely productive I'm not buying into any hyper potential I'm into work he's into work and our entire offense is into doing what's in the best interest of the team and I'm really excited to get to practice on Wednesday this drama is it going to what Tom Brady just told you everything you need to know right that he put it out and laid it on the table for you I don't care what you did before you got here none of that matters I don't care about the touchdowns about the money may have got or did not get when you come to New England Patriots there is a Patriot Way and there's a way that we do things you have to be extremely and selfish so by my standards I don't think it's going to work on a one-year prove it deal because that's exactly what you have to do you got to prove it for the next contract you you playing this year for next year and so you go from a team that need you to a team that does not need you they got a ton of weapons over there and so let's talk about the workload that he has a front of him because it takes at least two three four months to learn a new sister I mean to really know it right to to know the checks to know the read going to be able to adjust on the fly in real Gametime situation maybe it's going to spend half the season just trying to learn the Playbook and so then you have to factor in the chemistry right that that receiver the quarterback chemistry that takes years to build that is not just plug and play you don't just show up Week 1 and say I got Tom Brady I'm ready to go ball out because there's a bunch of the guys in front of you that have been there since minicamp OTAs that have a significant has started four years oh yeah it's going to work but to to be to think that you can just step into a organization like the Patriots and say Tom Brady's my quarterback I'm about to go ball out in week 2 when I don't even know anything about this team I don't think that's going to work out and I think that he has to be extremely unselfish as well but also understand and know that or you got a lot of go ahead of you a lot and then you have to go play football so I don't think it's going to work out has something very interesting we play offense and we do what's in the best interest of operant Antonio Brown is always done what was in the best interest of Antonio Brown's let me ask you a question if your what happened let's just say he's open and he doesn't get the ball that we saw last year in Pittsburgh when he was open to he get the ball he threw a water cooler Z platinum ticket everything for what happened he's open and he doesn't get the ball the one thing you don't see from Patriots offense of player is buy a body language Ain't No Stopping no shoulder ain't no taking a heads up I was open hands up like this where you going with the ball at the end of the day Skip I just don't think it's going to work because I don't know how much a Antonio Brown is going to be willing to change for the longest time he's been the man and when you're the man you get all the attention I'm getting all their targets the coach goes into the game like how many different ways can we get Antonia the ball they what they do because only given Sunday a team I said you know what we're taking Tom Brady away and Son of Michelle and Burkhead in those running back run for 2:50 and you got to be perfectly fine for that and then you watch Julio go for 275 you wifey heart go for 185 Mike Evans get 165 you got to catch a 14-yard that's real pressure too because guess what you can't be a top by receiving that offense we will be very interesting to see I've said this before I don't believe it's going to work because I believe at the at at the heart of everything is his selfishness and you went to an organization that require you to be selfless bit zealous Drew good line I predicted before this show that Reggie Bush would say this will work and I'm surprised pleasantly surprised that you just said no and you made some really strong football point I had not thought of because you can't just snap your fingers and say okay let's go platinum you my bills play at Miami because obviously if any coach and quarterback can make this work these two guys because they're both watch us guys like what we watch what we do with the guy with all the baggage watch what we've done with Josh Gordon but it took time with Josh right he had to figure it out he had to figure out Brady because there's no quarterback who requires more precise route-running and timing than Tom Brady nobody nobody does because the ball is 123 gone he's not going to do Deshawn he's not going to wait and say I'll duck under and scrambled left throwing you can hit me up under my chin well I'm not going to do it because he's forty-two and he wants to play until 8:45 so the timing has to be precisely perfect will you can't just snap your fingers and say let's go in the backyard, come stay at my house look on the backyard on the day off and we'll figure it out will they obviously if they really wanted to to break the system for this one player they could say let's give baby three routes and we will feature him in the game plan with those three and we'll practice goes on Wednesday Thursday Friday if you have to fit into their or they're not spending enough they're not built they built the office around a guy 12 maybe the best chemistry in the league will be Edelman and Brady so much is required of that slot receiver on check with knees and Annabeth rounds 889 years in the making Josh Gordon is figuring it out as we saw on Sunday night and Phillip Dorsett is starting to get it but it took three years so you starting to figure it out and he finally got a deeper out that he got Freon and hit him right in the hands with it right now n'keal Harry look like he was just starting to get on Brady's page and he hurt himself he's gone for eight games but trust me he's a stud man get bail check never has taken a receiver in the first round until this past rap music make you laugh so you don't think he's got a place here right when forward Phillip Dorsett catching a few passes is one thing because he was catching a few passes in Hindi it was easier for me to transition going from Denver to Baltimore because my production that started increasing now you catch me in the prime and I go to Baltimore and all the sudden I'm catching fix the ball as opposed to the 80s. We don't have a problem Skip Bayless how do you go from Catching 118 127 all the way down to 55 60 so you go from a game where you might not get any Targets because with the Patriots the way they operate is it can be anybody can be Rex Burkhead it could be James White and we'll get five or six the running back in there passing James really good so they'll have a couple routes are him easy routes that won't make they won't throw him into the fire because he won't be ready there's no way he will be ready to understand the total complexity of this offense and to be able to play fast and it because ultimately in this office you have to be to play Fast Ferry cannot be out there second-guessing your routes right people telling you what am I people telling you this is what you got on this play like they don't have time for that and so somebody else might be ready to play November first name is Rob Gronkowski not mentally and physically what if he does what if n'keal Harry and Rock join this group and abs in the middle of it helped me out that probably get a smaller okay I'll be there in time for Grant with the most dominant opposite play it all the football and he wasn't getting eight nine targets a game sometimes you only got five 6 because the deepest would dictate what they going to do on a given Sunday okay y'all want to stop and run okay Tom's going to throw for 400 y'all don't play coverage okay we going to run for 2. That's the way it is I didn't mind telling us get Rookie young guys coming in there without to order lineup and what they got to do with it some point I'm like damn dude you can the check to you need to tell your playbook I got to worry about it I got to worry about what I got to line up with what I got to do on this adjust and I got to tell you what do I do play book this stick to it is not small a guy who studies the game or it's just comes so easy that he hasn't had you on Whittier and that's what's so amazing about him I got tired of hearing to just like a drive I got tired of your wife and bingo pick Maggie studying the opponent you not studying him studying them in Oklahoma rolling to another win over the weekend as sooner still dropped in the AP Top 25 falling from 4th to 5th after being you know if frogs by LSU for quite a while I don't know if you were going to like that word you have been all in on Phelan in the Sooners I was outraged when I saw this and I got a little outrage listening to the great Kirk Herbstreit do The Telecast on Saturday night I watched the whole game and I love Kirk and I'm usually right with Kirk and his evaluations and Impressions an opinion but as the game wore on he was starting to make the case unless you look so good tonight maybe they should vote to the number one and I believe that has weighed some of the voters just like the number one I'm watching LSU give up 530 yards to Sam ehlinger in the Texas Longhorns albeit in Austin but LSU is gone from defense all defense to all offense and no defense 530 yards and also knew LeapFrog a teen Oklahoma that can only do what it does you know what can beat you soon again beat South Dakota South Dakota do you really want Alabama in the regular season on your relevant if you're not nasty C I don't think so you want Lincoln Riley's off all the time you got to play defense defense has the second most yards in LSU history for the first time in LSU history three receivers go over a hundred yards as you mention they're not a doctor I talked off and now they are throwing team I think the coordinator capable of the only defense it's a big blast the big for you what are the biggest issue for me that I have is the fact that we have to have this conversation cuz there's only four teams they let in the playoffs right like why do I why do I only get to see four teams play against each other in the playoffs right because that be the same thing if it's in the NCAA basketball we just go right to the final four right to me there a lot of good teams out there Auburn Alabama Texas Clemson LSU Ohio State what are some really good teams out there who I would love to see those teams duke it out and battle it out in a playoff system but how many 8 8 10 12 and then maybe get to you call first when you call me if you want all your games and maybe get a chance T-Mac how we Bama and we will decide who is he can't handle that business we don't get to play LSU Texas got some for y'all go to the Red River route to go to the county fair they're real good don't worry I'm proud of every Saturday on big noon kickoff the new college football show on Fox with loving watching you guys thanks for coming in is it too early to start comparing the Cowboys current weapons to their number for the Saints the well-documented non-call and last season's NFC Championship game help the Rams advance to the Superbowl the league to allow pass interference has to be challenged now they say it's March into Los Angeles as a two and a half Point Underdog according to Fox bet that occurred after the missed call to affect the outcome of that game we're not joined by former NFL head coach Jeff Fisher cuz it have user well this morning coach behind you or use it as motivation behind them unlikely that the colosseum's going to be full of saints fans with with the official shirts on it so I think it's over you know they had the whole offseason to deal with it and you know as soon as you know coach says that's plenty other plays in the game that could have you know that could have made a difference of the stuff I'd be more concerned about the tight end if I was around right now and Jared Cook on The Winning Side try telling that to Sean Payton but because the call was because the car was so egregious they change the rules and I think the thing is that they talked about it so long shot but I don't know I don't know if he's talking about it but I don't know if he's really gotten over it he has his owners of the write a letter she wrote a letter to the NFL you've been in there for you you've been on The Winning Side losing the Super Bowl is very very difficult right over but this set of circumstances where you don't go because of like the light I would I would suggest that that's more difficult the night's over Bow Wow so I said the day after it was the worst non-call in the history of this league because of the magnitude and the circumstance and as I watch it again right now he just gets worse by the viewing to me yeah Nickell Robey Coleman said yesterday who was in the middle of it he was the culprit and he has dried up after the game which would have made it worse you know like for the Saints like he just said yeah I did it cuz I thought I was so beaten I just had to do it but it was so egregious that it's still hot it's mind-boggling to to watch that again and said how did the first three Rifts within sort of Striking Distance how could nobody reach for a flag of living talking about that since the play I think we're two or three more days of it and it's going to be put behind us we're going to be reminded to out the year as you get a call or non-call Hera opr DPI and it's reviewed and it's not overturned or this happens cuz anytime you put a rule in like that you got these quote unintended consequences and yeah I was on it for 15 years yeah so you're going to have things that come up that's why they put in for a year and we'll just see what happens but where's your gut feeling on it I think it's stays in but it's going to be modified yeah we had some place this weekend where you know defensive holding was called in and DPI wasn't called just because they were start about going to review or ground though you had all those things that you got o p i d p r u get pics on the line of scrimmage now those things have come up so it's going to have to be like that I think to have a play overturned I was going to have to come off or like like everybody used to say back when Mike Holmgren you says if 50 guys in a bar think it's dpict I still call it you know so that's kind of where I think it's more days of this so well once we get the kick-off just as a coach are you okay that that can now be reviewed just but you better be very clear in your mother time out you're so precious and you better have a good feel for the way they're going to look at it has to be obvious and you can't knit pick in the second half to try to be to get a first down cuz I'm not going to overturn it so to me the the professional the NFL DPI penalty is so penal because it's a spot foul in I was watching a lot of college football in and you see kids every week if they get beaten they just they just grab and hold because it's only 15 yards what would you rather do the guy comes up every year in the early in the offseason with a committee they want to go to the college will this look at the college rule for you let's see what okay and it's always shot down just because I just can't we can't change it but you know it's a huge field position change them when that call is incorrect or there's not an element in the game and if we just understand that as a premise that they're going to make mistakes and replay should be there to overturn the obvious mistakes they're going to be mistakes in the game we don't have things to talk about like this when the ball the turnover is involved whether to pick was it not a pic was it a fumble was it not a fumble but when you start talking that's a subject field anal sex and that's really not subjective pee is really like I think he did it and I threw the flag or so when you start doing that you opening up a Pandora's Box and because the thing is that you get the Hail Mary at the end of the half the end of the game Fish House that's when you like there's a lot going on and somebody's going to lose the game because of a Hail Mary in the US just what you asked for you open door a and but you didn't realize all what was behind door 8 now this is going to be a replay review iguana coaches challenge by the end of the game but yeah it has to be clear and obvious so you're going to have to jerk somebody down and be the first call in the history of the NFL work but it was made with the ball in the one-yard line with no time left for the extended. So you got all those different if I Can See Clearly up on one review play that they tax the intended target of the Hail Mary in the end zone with no time left OK make sure your position picture you're back in and moving forward towards the ball and bat and a ball down at don't catch that we know all those things could be different you saw some things this past weekend enforcement with respect to replay even in the same game I think you know Sean was caught what are you doing well there's a 10-second runoff if you got to run and clock that was because of a play in their game 5 years ago and and so could you imagine the defender intercept the ball off and running around getting tackled and then the the the the opponent challenging it because he pushed off before he got it and now it goes review and now the balls were awarded to the it's incomplete and it comes back and I got to run time for more time back on in what town is it in you know it there's a lot those are the unintended consequences that they you know do you have any call in your career that still sticks in your craw will you look back and say we really got robbed there is there one that you remember it was a it was a bizarre and it was kind of a game against Baltimore in Tennessee and we're running out of time it was an afternoon but anyways Steve we will run out of time we're going to have tight ends in and he sneaks the ball in the end zone but as he is it was we score it's a hurry up and the defense of the Ravens defense is not set in their kind of jumping through the Gap you could get set and so the referee says due to the magnitude of the play I'll never forget this we're going to have one on time. Haha so we had a one-time down to hang it in the Monday night game are you there I know that you were totally fine with the Rolling Stones hope you have doubts he did they score on the Blues game question yes they did the clocks Road climbs rolling and he just got it and then he did was that the year you played in the play that game that was the most physical football game I ever witnessed was that the Ray Lewis vs Bills that were battles in that game as you get older you forget everything but when you do remember you remember more of the losses than you do the winds I remember those twins are fine but I remember the laws that we had the jacket you remember the loss of weight like every other day Mark Brunell I remember dropping a touchdown against Buffalo and the 91 yeah we had to go to Buffalo we're 12 and 4. A better Conference record and we lost in 7 they went to the Superbowl and we didn't and you still talk to makes you such a competitor it's those moments that will probably fueled you know that's what he talks I don't want to watch taco is he will continue to wear his high-end designer watch during games the NFL plan to talk to obj about the watch stating that players aren't allowed to wear hard objects on the field Odell set up the watch is plastic and therefore by the letter of the law is allowed the receiver also said he was just being targeted and if it wasn't the watch then he would have been criticized for how he tied his shoes Shannon should Odell be allowed to wear this one will know but if there's no way there's nothing in the manual that says how you tie your shoe is how busy it hard objects isn't allowed since that Richard Mille said this watch has indestructible so how hard must have to correctly so how hard must be skip if it's indestructible some hard plastic really Odell is this where you want to plant your flag if it's so this is this where you said you know what I'm dropping anchor here I watch Anthony V skip I don't want to be about to watch but I wanted to be about football an affair between like if it's not if it's not one thing it's something else Odell do you realize why you're in Cleveland if it's not one thing I agree but you know what we wanted to be something else with someone else we can you up out of here are you have to get paid making them the highest paid receiver that said you know what we rather move on without you he doesn't get it Skip and he wants them to make an exception the exception is you can't wear Heart Jewelry on the field that's the exception Bella making exception for you on that why don't why don't you get that from that's what I don't get a bee got attention for the wrong reasons Odell you do realize that a bee with getting attention for all the wrong reasons yet now you get going attention C we talkin about a watch 32 watch so so to speak Odell is saying watch this as in watch me wear my watch on Sunday because he has like so many Diva receivers attention deficit disorder he needs attention and he's not getting enough so I wear my watch and now he's claiming that it's become a permanent fixture in wrist as in he wears it in the shower he sleeps with it he never takes off his new wife he loves his new orange banded watch so he's a white line on the blanket because we all know during football games you need to know what time it is oh yeah I did overtime hear the game over with I got to get out of here all the things that you can stand up so you know what I'm upset at the NFL about I'm upset about not having guaranteed contracts I'm not I'm upset about not having lifetime medical benefits of all the things you want to take a stand against or watch Norma's give if I want me to buy the real quick point you played for a long time I covered for a long time is any player ever want to watch other you brought up Reggie Roby but he was he was a stopwatch the time any flights of his that was back in the late 80s 90s maybe they changed the rule for that very reason maybe but there's a reason I asked if they have the about you check you know cast is not made of concrete and they made of a hard subject but they don't want people out there without hard something tracking people inside the head and said that watching indestructible if something is indestructible how hard must it be hard is your head why Odell okay you got the attention you got a 200000 and you got so much bread you can play it if something would have happened to it no problem bro I'm good. Just take the watch off and just ball out you better than this if it's not one thing it's another what is not proposing to the kicking net it's the video in the Paris hotel room right you got the attention that whether you want it or not but you can't say you want to make it about football when you do it other things besides playing the game of football I mean that with the Giants when he played with the Giants this year can I get you to give you know you not in New York you know I don't that is a fact and it's I think very significant he's not a paid spokesman for this company are you just doing our zone for attention why do it again say it again but I want the dog had on the US Open yeah I like to have that one but I want that Seco I got my luck charm how can you wear a knee brace on those hard object yeah but they have a purpose of watch does what exactly for you that's give me 7 talkin about it here we got me to Cocoa Beach black skip what I just located my elbow I had to have a brace on but I had to have a soft cover the top of that I just could have a brace out there yep hard I'll be up and I were in the pan on top of it I wouldn't want to play with the brace brace if you don't happen to have a job he did not notice how can you not see that you're you're famous white out comes out wearing a watch time you can call me another plate when I get the ball thrown in my direction you know what time it is yell during every drama with obj and the last thing we talked about is how he actually performs on the field we haven't talked about it it's no longer I took the focus off 43 to 13 yes trying everything have happened to Odell's give his self inflicted make the light we need something to talk about is he knew he he got exactly what he is Hope for not won the game yeah but no you can't wear that over there just let just just take it off I promise you we obj without that watch because you obj before you got to watch I got to tell you when the weather turns cold out there in Cleveland as he refers to it he's going to be a little Lonesome out there for the Big Apple now on we have heard so much about her and have so many questions finally you live in the flesh and Studio Ernestine welcome to Undisputed this is a bad idea here we go about to lose my first debate ever on this show and look what she's already done to me and I didn't know this was coming she upstage me on Black Friday she's in all black I didn't plan it but I am this is Catherine this is how how to keep your relationship alive when you live with a sports obsessed guy so I imagine there was a little inspiration in your own household why'd you write this book there was I know nothing about sports I knew nothing about sports I do know a whole lot about sports now but 14 years ago when I met this lovely man I absolutely had no idea what sports was I did not come from a sports family my dad like baseball occasionally my brother like soccer but I had never been to a football game in my life and to this day I still have not been to a football game in my life and that is the truth he doesn't go eat that is also the truth and so I ever came to being at a football game was I play clarinet and I was in the marching bands so that was the closest I ever came to being at a live football games are quick story I'm at a show called cold pizza she and I had each gotten out of long-term relationship shortly before this happen and you were working a big PR firm in New York city that show was based at 34th and 8th in the old New Yorker Hotel in the basement and she is a PR executive watch Kevin Dillon from Entourage and so I had your own cold pizza I book a cabin on skip show and I said I'm going to go and I walked into the green room and then this guy passes the door by and why did the guy pass by for the first and last time in my career because you can have tested this I left my notes for our final segment in my dressing-room never done it before or since so this is meant to be I literally ran cuz we have 3 minutes or so ran down a Long Hall past the Green Room to toward my dressing room as I passed she waved hi and I stopped in my tracks this was this was the funniest story before my the past relationship I was in he would watch sports and he was at my apartment one day watching the game and then he had a show and I said hey what's that show that you're watching you said all these two guys debate each other he said this guy is really good this guy is an idiot and the idiot was skip nice looking and then 30 seconds when I stop and look at her and I think I think I said she handed me her card she completely she said she lived at 15 is getting me so confused and nervous he was interrogating me within 2 minutes to deliver to 52nd and 1st and like I live at 51st and 2nd and I was so out of my head and then he said who I have to go and I said well if you ever need PR here's my card and so I gave him my card and later that literally first sight so we end up soon going on our first date and I've told this story before and she despises a story but I told her right out of the box cuz I knew this had a chance to go somewhere so we don't rust Avenue Pizza Place of whole wheat pizza place you will always be in my life cuz I'm married to little did she know how married I am as you know watching games email for 2 weeks he said why don't you call me tonight we can speak on the phone I just have to watch Yankees game and I thought that's nice is watching Yankees game then I didn't know the magnitude of him watching sports Apple iWatch Sport and then it was Sports and sports and so after that I said I am I going to deal with this guy and my mother who was from the Lower East Side of Manhattan to have lived many years she said listen you got it this guy is a good guy he said he wants to watch a game with you he doesn't want to go to Hooters I just want to hang out with his friends why don't you don't do that so I said okay but then one day I became another game of Uno the game and after that the book came out of because I've learned so much about dealing with a guy who love sports and all of the women that are out there that have guys that are like Skip and only mine is magnified by a thousand percent I have tips and tricks along the way of how to keep it a log in through the most tips and tricks from my Jenks demons because I got them you you have some fun and the job is become one so that's what they want until it's this is not I will concede that is about to ensue because she still doesn't get the Jinx rules the first huge violation came last year in the playoffs the Tom Brady at my homeboy game in the AFC Championship game what happened early in that game it's already 7:00 or nothing New England and New England is driving and whines up with 3rd and goal from the 1-yard line what would Tom Brady not do in that circumstance what does she know I told her I need 3 hours this is it this is our biggest game we're going to lead with this right although then something happened the Saints game there but the point is that it's it's 3rd and goal from the one and I told her just don't bother me don't open the door I'm in my room watching my two TVs but this time is just one big TV and she opens the door right on cue and sticks her head and said hey I got this done give you this letter I don't know what this letter in a five letter that came for it was on the weekend and I said oh my God this is an important letter he needs his letter as my witness I don't I don't like this and Tom Brady throws it right to Reggie Ragland does the linebacker for Kansas he hits him and and I I fall on the floor and in one of our biggest fights ever ensues and I still haven't gotten over it she gets over it a lot faster than I do once again that game because I open the door this is insane. I'm in Century City in Los Angeles and what I just cuz I open the door it changed the game and Kansas City yes it changed the game against we have Hazel our little Maltese that we love with his daughter all the time in the house looking for Hazel and Hazel disappears and then I hear Hazel I can't find her then I I I go towards skips room Hazel's in with Skip and then I realized I hear him saying okay just did he is okay okay watch the game with me he uses her like a little like a little four leaf clover a little buddha so go to girl is in there and only when the game starts losing his team is losing he boots are out and then her and she's scratching at the door she wants to get back in and it works or it doesn't work so what just happened a week ago last night opening Thursday night Green Bay at Chicago I had picked Chicago you'd picked Aaron Rodgers is Mitchell trubisky but that's a whole nother story so Green Bay the first three possessions in the first quarter goes for a grand total of -19 yards remember this so first possession of the second order its first and ten at the 25 I had told that she said you want me to fix your dinner I said sure but but she knows the rules bring it at half time or at least wait until the corners over time so when I say to him hey I'm in the kitchen hey do you want your dinner I'm going to make something to eat its 5 will you know it's 8 and I'm like a parallel universe along with the Jinx world so what happened she comes barging in the door and I turned her and I said watch what's about to happen I told you as God as my Riaz I said watch what's about to happen near Rogers takes the Snapper download fake reverse action if we could see this play and he throws like the equivalent of a punt like a Hail Mary and it goes up in the sky and down and all the sudden comes right down to valdes-scantling 4D game-breaking completion of the game did it not break the game over did you get it packet has no idea how powerful you are getting yourself out two and a half hours a day and I'm exhausted when I leave here I'm exhausted how you done this for 14 years my God that Jesus isn't her biggest compromise she kept trying to like football she has a hard time with football it's a little too complicated plus they wear helmets can see the but guess what's great the face lifelong Spurs fan so she started watching Spurs and then she started watching NBA and she fell in love with the NBA because you can see faces and physiques only way that I can actually sit for hours through a game as I came up with this little concoction idea I pick out the cute guys so the kid guys give me a reason to watch the game so now I've been said yes I've invested I've invested my time I so then I sit with Skip and then I really like a couple of guys and I'll say it again hey it's really important part of the game Hay is he married yet he's not got to know all the Spurs back so he was married but now he has a girlfriend when you watching the game with him can you root against his team-high Hawaii is one of my favorite number whatever number to and she still loves him uses for he was a major fight about this constant best has it look you cannot sit with me and root against somebody I'm rooting for I get that's giving you know you can see we're in this together with Team I do and he was the Only Rule is if she's watching a Spurs game especially a big one or a playoff game if she starts watching she can't stop she can't leave because if they get off to a good start is Jeff I always ask you before are you going to stay or you want to walk cuz I'm happy for her to watch make sure that I've emptied my bladder before I go because otherwise I know you have to be 18 we got us a bit much I thought I was a bit over-the-top he
