from The New York Times unlikable borrow explosive you out Studio exec known for producing a wine stain is responding tonight after the New York Times revealed Decades of sexual harassment claims against him for choosing mini bottle wine stain out of his own company over sexual harassment. so before all that in the summer 2017 weeks into my joining Jody on the Harvey Weinstein investigation we were stuck today on The Daily my colleagues Meghan toohey and Jodi Kantor like so many other reporters who tried and failed to report on Weinstein we were hitting roadblock after roadblock people won't return our calls we couldn't find any records or documents there were so many hints and indications that there was a story there we were just really having a hard time figuring out how to crack it open it really seems like Harvey Weinstein had just been a master and covering his tracks so in the midst of all of these challenges and frustrations I decide that I'm going to call Gloria Allred Loren Allred calls herself the most famous woman attorney practicing law be criticized and would be investigated and she is famous Avenger she was my Advocate I feel that it's not a commitment my total commitment to making social change to probably the most victims rights advocate in the country we already who says that they are entitled to equal a services and Privileges and she has been at the Forefront of fighting for women's issue after women's issue I've been commemorated on Memorial Day for decades is a class-action email or child support Riot charging women more for alterations than men and by far the most visible work thank you for coming today I'm attorney Gloria Allred has been fighting on behalf of women who have been victims of sexual harassment and sexual assault by powerful men tomorrow Bill Cosby will perform his far from finished tour in Atlanta Georgia he is performing despite the fact that more than 40 women have publicly accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting them know you name it like you name a case with a high-profile man alleged of sexual harassment or sexual assault if there was no one else contact she understands she has experienced she does it every day in her work you can almost guarantee that Gloria Allred was part of that Justice is long overdue for these Brave women and they will be silent no more so I reach out to her thinking this is somebody who knows this landscape and may be able to help me figure it out but when we finally connected by phone call was actually pretty brief and actually pretty disappointing unit to be fair I didn't actually provide her with a lot of information to help inform the phone call no I didn't tell her one of the key things which was that it was Harvey Weinstein we were investigating and that's because of this email that Jodi had just gotten so just a few weeks before Megan and Gloria spoke on the phone I was on a flight to La I was trying to get more people to talk to me about Weinstein it was pretty tough going I was riding solo on the story at that point in spending a lot of days just calling people and not getting any answers so many people were just afraid to speak and so I'm sitting there on the flight I'm on the Wi-Fi and lo and behold this email lands and its from Lisa Bloom and she says I'd like to speak with you briefly about a story you're working on do you have time for a phone call to off and we are still second-class citizens and I got really excited because I do women's rights cases I say this every day when many sebelum is Gloria allred's daughter and to all of the victims are represented in high-profile cases they stand taller afterwards they feel very good about speaking your truth within she was second only to Gloria in her reputation as a fighter for women so if you are victimized if you are treated differently I hope you will stand up for your rights and that summer the two of them would be profiled and W magazine together just beautiful picture of them together looking strong and the headline says Gloria Allred and Lisa Bloom or the Defenders of women in 2017 we will find you come after you and bring you to Justice to the fullest extent pause you have been warned so were you thinking at this point I thought this is amazing she knows about Weinstein victims and she is calling to help so I wrote back and I said I'm actually on my way to LA right now can I stop by your office tomorrow and then I forwarded the email to our colleague Emily Steel because Emily had broken open the Bill O'Reilly story and I knew that Lisa Bloom had represented one of the alleged victims So within minutes and email comes back from Emily and she says stop I have to call you so what Emily told me once I landed was that Lisa Bloom had tweeted very excitedly a few months before Harvey Weinstein and Jay-Z are making a movie out of my book suspicion nation and Lisa Bloom was actually in business with Harvey Weinstein so once I only said that I knew that Lisa Bloom wasn't contacting me to help with the story instead she was working with Harvey Weinstein this is why despite hoping that Glory would be a good lead you were hesitant to tell her what you were working I mean her daughter was working with the subject of your investigation exactly so this was just the beginning of a realization we had at first thought that these two attorneys this mother and daughter would be key is that could help us unlock the Weinstein story but over time we would learn that and their own separate ways they actually help keep it secret last week Megan and Jody published a book she said documenting their investigation of Harvey Weinstein in writing it they discovered new information about 2 feminist icons that raises questions about their legacies and about the legal system in which they work today part 1 Lisa Bloom it's Wednesday September 18th so what do we now know about the role of Lisa Bloom in The Harvey Weinstein story what we've now realize is that the moment that Lisa Bloom called Judy Cantu her in the summer 2017 she had already been working with Harvey Weinstein 4 months she had crossed over to the other side at a rate of $895 an hour to help this powerful producer CE to evade scrutiny and conceal his alleged predatory behavior and how do you know that well we know that because after you publish that first Weinstein story we kept reporting and we have since obtained these confidential records that spell out all of the various things that Lisa Bloom did in fact you for Weinstein there were the billing records and what she gives an hour-by-hour accounting of the various things that she did on his behalf we also obtained this document which Looking Back Now really was a blue for the various tactics that she was going to use to try to keep everything hidden and tell us about that document Lisa blooms job audition memo for what she was willing to do for Harvey Weinstein it appears that he wanted powerful woman by his side one with a very public reputation for protecting victims which is what discipline has exactly can I just read it to you I'll read some and then I'm going to pass over to Megan cuz it's really long this is from December 2016 and she writes a long email to Weinstein proposing how she's essentially going to beat back allegations by Rose McGowan the actress against Weinstein now at that point McGowan had tweeted that a producer had raped her and people thought it was Weinstein but Rose had named him yet but wine seen clearly felt very threatened my destiny it had some sort of conversation and then what Lisa Bloom does is she writes what's essentially a roadmap for Harvey Weinstein how she is going to manipulate and smear in order to discredit Rose McGowan Harvey it was a treat to speak to you today though yes we'd all prefer better circumstances I spend the rest of the day reading Jack and Sarah's thorough reports about Rose by the way those are private investigators who truly comes across as a disturbed pathological liar and also your former assistant who seems to be less of a concern I also read through a lot of roses Twitter feed to get a sense of her and watched her short film Dawn and no some critics I found a dreadful but telling us to Who Rose his Boy Meets Girl girl trusts boy boy murders girl all men suck the end I feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world because I have represented so many of them start out as impressive bold women but the more one presses for evidence the weaknesses and lies are revealed she doesn't seem to have much going on these days except for rapidly escalating identity as a feminist Warrior which seems to be entirely based on her online rants for her to keep her rosearmy following she must continue ramping up the outrageousness of her diatribes clearly she must be stopped in her ridiculous defamatory attacks on you she's dangerous you're right to be concerned options after my initial read which I can flush out when our next call number one initiating friendly contact with her through me or other good intermediary and after establishing a relationship work out a win-win key question what does she want to direct it appears number to countertops online campaign to push back and call her out as a pathological liar a few well-placed articles now will go a long way of things blow up for us down the line we can place an article re her becoming increasingly unglued so that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she is discredited we have all the facts based on publicly available information this can begin simultaneous with number one number 3 cease and desist letter for me warning her of the violation of agreement with you risked she poses the letter online generating heat and backlash Sarah she's seizing Sarah the private investigator I need to see the agreement please she's talking about a settlement that Harvey Weinstein paid to Rose McGowan in the 90s following the alleged rape so she's talking about strategies to keep the payment that he made to her secret number for you and I come out publicly in a preemptive interview or you talk about evolving on women's issues prompted by death of your mother and may be nasty and founded hurtful rumors about you this will be headline-grabbing if you expressed genuine Contrition for anyone who you hurt while emphasizing it was always adults in sexual behavior you thought that was enough at the time but now I realize it's more nuanced than a power imbalance mean something excetera you reached out to me to help understand rapidly evolving social mores around sexual misconduct because you are a good and decent person as evidenced by your life's work making films on important social issues and extremely generous philanthropy example Charlie Sheen as women were set to not against him read HIV status he did a Today Show interview recently where he came out with it himself receiving massive praise I represented a few of the women and their stories were largely drowned out by his interview and the love he got for it it is so cute from a reputation management standpoint to be the first to tell the story I strongly recommend this if you agree I'd like to come out and meet with you to go over the story in some detail so this is done for maximum Effectiveness you should be the hero of the story not the villain this is very doable number 5 start the wind in Foundation focusing on gender equality and film or established the Weinstein standards which seat to have 1/3 of films directed by women or written by women or passing the bechdel test two names female characters talk to each other about something besides a man whatever announce you will immediately raise standards we gender party in very specific ways all films under your control announce partnership with Geena Davis's group that works for gender equality and film for example by mandating the half of all extras In Crowd scenes will be female you got the idea these details can be worked out but the point is you decide to be a leader and raise the bar in a concreet headline-grabbing way number 6 positive reputation management I Googled your name and a few of noxious articles pop-up I work with a leading reputation management company that can back thanks for the positive articles which prevents negative pieces from ranking well on Google the first page of Google is key as 95% never go beyond the first Google page let's improve this easy to do this should happen simultaneously with other option and then she ends up a reminder would you please connect me with David boys so that I can get retained David boys as one of the attorneys who has worked most closely with Weinstein going back 15 years as he's worked against the allegations against him also given that your emails with the Clinton campaign were hacked recently I recommend you set up a secure new email account for emails with this team we shouldn't be emailing on sensitive matters to your company email is your it people may have access thanks and really honored to be brought into this team talk tomorrow best Lisa blue we'll be right back this episode is supported by 20th century Fox's new film Ad Astra Brad Pitt stars is Ryan McBride and Astronaut who marks on a mission across the Galaxy in search of his missing father who disappeared in space years ago while searching for extraterrestrial life once presumed Dead new information suggests he still alive and leading experiments that could destroy all life in our solar system Royce turning into space will uncover secrets that challenge the nature of human existence and ask for lunches in theaters September 20th and I'm one of the people that make this show before you work at the New York Times I didn't quite understand what the reporters here did and now that I've gotten a chance to see how much hard work how much persistence goes into just one story that goes out I feel like my subscription to the New York Times is a way of me becoming like a stockholder and what it is that they're doing I almost feel like a sense of camaraderie when they blue open the doors in a big investigation it's my subscription money that's helping them find the complicated and difficult truth of the world and put it in the public sphere none of the work that we get the chance to do would be possible if it wasn't for people who subscribe if you're already a subscriber thank you if you're wondering how you could pitch in to help more reporting more shows like the daily exist just get a subscription to the New York Times the daily is the New York Times so what do you make of this memo she saying I am going to use my experience representing vulnerable women to help you instead to intimidate vulnerable women exactly I think she's saying I'm going to take all of my experience working on the behalf of victims and use that on your behalf to work against them I also know I'm going to ask this as a question because we don't have Lisa Bloom here and I don't know the answer but I think it raises questions about her work generally Beyond Rose McGowan because it's this line they start out as impressive bold women but the more one presses for evidence the weaknesses and lies are revealed what does that mean does that mean that she hasn't believed her clients over the years and what about the billing records that you found one of those show well I'm looking right now through her billing records and it's just the sort of day-by-day hour-by-hour accounting of what she did for Harvey Weinstein her team as well that's what lawyers do they send these really detailed bills so let's just take a couple of examples these records say things like for 3017 phone call Reed reputation management a show which actually is one of the phrases that was just used in that memo and really suggests that she's following up on the things that you promised to do in managing Harvey Weinstein's reputation 17 review investigative research on RM so RMS Rose McGowan there digging around Rose McGowan and then my own name is a meeting with Harvey reach out to Jodi Kantor research Jodi Kantor 2 hours so it turns out the buffet she called me she was doing all this research on me so prepping for a conversation with you at I think you said the rate was 895 it's a $1,600 job and then she was paid $895 after that 7:12 this is important prepare for meeting with Anna call with Harvey follow up with rounded so Hannah is a fake name for a paid is really private Spy Who Weinstein is employing at this point to try to do you prepare quarters and sources and get information from them and remember that this is all in her own hand he saw her billing record so it looks like she was very deeply involved follow up with Ronin that of course is Ronan Farrow New Yorker magazine exactly was working on a very similar investigation cars at the same time review Rose Pi reports TI private investigator that's a badass at 97 e mail emails re NBC ronan's conflict research journalist ethics so that looks like they're preparing to go to war against Ronan Farrow and by the way I am reading a fraction of the entries on this document to you it's a very long and a lot of what she's describing these billing Records Was invisible to us in the beginning of our investigation we had no idea of what the actual work she was doing for him but as the billing records reach their completion we are able to see activity that was in fact that the Ball Toss in the final stretch as Lisa Bloom flew to New York to be by Weinstein side and the final days is he was working to be back or investigation she bills him for this pretty remarkable meeting that we had at the New York Times there was a moment as we were working to get to the Finish Line where Harvey Weinstein basically barged into the New York Times with Lisa Bloom and a couple other lawyers by his side demanding an off-the-record meeting and Lisa Bloom had in her hands full ders that included pictures of Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd and friendly poses with Weinstein in an effort to undermine and some are the accusers so easily you can see the reality that more and more of our time is going towards trying to stop the publication of your investigation that that's really becoming the book for exactly then after all those months all those efforts she finally faces the music and recognizes that this story is going to run and there's nothing that her client can do to stop it and it appears to have been 11:38 p.m. the night before story ran she sends an email to Weinstein and some of his other attorneys acknowledging that they had not succeeded in killing the time story and basically advising that at this point her new pitches that Wednesday and should acknowledge that he didn't gauged and sexual harassment Express remorse and promise to do better and then the second part of her pitch is that she will come in with a statement and that she will actually testify on his behalf she is pitching a statement and what she says is a woman's rights Advocate I've been blind with Harvey and his listen to me I have told him that times have changed it is 2017 and he needs to evolve to a higher standard I said Harvey to be refreshingly candid and receptive to my message has acknowledged mistakes he has made and as we work together on a project bringing my book to the screen he's always been respectful towards me and the next day and the hour before we publish our story Lisa Bloom sent us basically that statement how can I look at it again after all this time part of what's interesting is the link between this and that very first audition memo she laid out for Weinstein like she's trying to describe him trying to become a better person and treat women respectfully she says he has been working on a major foundation with USC with one of the largest grants for female directors which started well over a year ago so that tracks exactly what the plan she had laid out for him she's executing what is it active number for so there we are moments from publishing the story and the role of Lisa Bloom is finally coming into Focus within a week we realize that her mother Gloria Allred had also played a surprising role Lisa Bloom declined to be interviewed for this episode on tomorrow's daily
