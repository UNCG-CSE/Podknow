episode of the show so we can actually talk about what the fuck happened so this episode is going to have a lot of spoilers basically all the spoilers for the whole season so if you haven't heard the series go back and binge it first so we were just listening to that South by Southwest talk so before we launched the show Ohio and I went to South by Southwest Philly play up a trailer but I told everybody I knew that we were going at South by Southwest. hi everybody thanks for coming like just intimate enough to actually hang out this good this was before the show come out and so there were a lot of Secrets then you couldn't talk about I want to tell them so many things we still in the last face but one of the big secrets didn't have to do with the investigation at all right it had to do with storytelling decision that we made when do we reveal ideas connection to the store right and we've always for as long as you and I were talking about that was like the thing that we live it's like and it's like it's like this personal journey and that's what made it interesting and so then Mark came in Marc smerling are other editor Omar came in at the 11th hour with this harebrained idea that turned out to be a genius that was let's not reveal it until after Rebecca's told the entirety of her story the story of them meeting sir just a few weeks before the show launched we went to South by Southwest to test out marks new structure idea of holding back my relationship with Rebecca yeah there's a there's a major secret that we will talk about this secret then we play the trailer and the trailer doesn't reveal that I'm her head and then I was like and by the way so how did you find out about this story why the big secret is that Rebecca is my mom I think it works and I remember it was an audible gasp in the room and we were like today Zach Austin and I peel back the curtain bed will give you some juicy secrets about how we made the show and will reflect on how we feel about it now from crime Town Mio to it right and this is a behind-the-scenes bonus episode of The Ballad of Billy balls hello are you alright tell me what you want to know first of all there might be a daughter and I think my mom might know her name for some reason she thinks that she lives in Oregon for well if your tell me what you're missing all of this is like we need the other stuff we have if we get this please report and we find out what happens to him and you can introduce some of that stuff coming together these to ilm Rebecca either bad or good we don't know but something's coming some sort of epilogue for The Ballad Of The Ballad The Ballad of Billy balls is presented by ADT real protection all right I owe so how did this whole thing come together how did it start I was planning to write a book it was called The Ballad of Billy balls and his baby girl Elsa and it was going to be a memoir nonfiction murder investigation book and then I was listening to all these True Crime podcast and went through a breakup and I was like in the sweltering sun and Joshua Tree building Furniture listening to every True Crime podcast I get my hands on I'm a sick mother fucker if you're right and then I heard your name as I was listening to crimetown welcome to crimetown King way I'd met Zach probably 15 or so years ago through my friend Jamie raised in Shadow Jaime who is working on a movie that Zac was editing and he wouldn't stop talking about this brilliant young editors access access so when I found out the exact gotten into podcasting I was just like I know I want to make a podcast I don't know I want to lick this medium is beautiful and exciting and really cool wolf and then I just asked you to have lunch you are starting to work on crimetown season 2 and it was freezing and we were at Whole Foods Gowanus I told him about the book and he was like that would make an epic podcast have you ever thought about making it back as soon as I thought about it but I didn't oh yeah that's genius because he was a musician and because you were saying my momma documented with big parts of her life is always recording her acting so crazy and wild in the way she talks is so crazy and wild and I figured everybody around would also be audio gold soon as you said it I was like yes it would be a podcast and I kept writing and whatever but it really at that point I was like oh that's what this is supposed to be and then I went off and try to make it on my own which is a great lesson in people saying no to things and you being like no I'm sure everybody I talk to from these other networks and suffer like we'll have you found the killer do you know how it ends and I was like no you don't understand it's not it's just it's an amorphous that it's a study in humanity and nobody wants to hear that they're like who's the good guy who's the bad guy and it's about love but that's what I couldn't articulate it but I knew you got it because we came up with it together by then the heavens parted and I came in here and you guys were like so this is awesome go have lunch with him and I was like okay who the fuck is that we are slammed and since the man and we want him to be like the lead on this from my perspective it was back in my car at so what do you think about this there's the end he gave me your pitch deck what was the appeal that he had it he explained it was his elevator pitch of the bathtub remember that clearly but it was something like all right so there's this murder mystery that takes place in the East Village in the early 80s and I was like who okay alright keep going he was a musician all right and I have to work with IO tillett Wright and so you know what that was it I was excited about it I was excited about the prospect of it we had no idea what it was going to be none of us and so that was that was honestly a little exciting so it was a thing where it was go have lunch with Ayo and see how you get along see if you'll be able to work together and then we sat down and had lunch and you would lovely and you told me about California and all this stuff and I was like let's do it we're doing this for me I was like I can send questions about him I think our only question that one is whether or not somebody was going to give us the money to make it right until we got kaydence really I'm bored and they came in and they were they were great the first trip when I came to New York in December I came here for a week before we had a green light I bought the ticket that week we just sat down I remember you like asking me what do you hope to get from this project and it was still all it was like raw meat you know so very late gun season than we should play some of that because it's like so interesting to hear I like the wide-eyed sort of all the things so in terms of this project what exactly do you want to get from this this is my first recorded sit down with Austin we need to piece together a picture of who Billy was a real picture of who Billy was versus my mom's interpretation and then we need to somehow which is going to be the hardest part crack the NYPD case files and get them to possibly incriminate themselves in a murder and it might just be that it might be right there on a piece of paper arresting officer will show and sell on this is the guy that shot him that's the guy want to get to I want to find who The Dude is who is the guy in the cowboy hat it's like strangely prescient or whatever certain things that you're saying like absolutely happen I want to sit down with him I want to ask him do you remember this man do you remember this day what happened why did you shoot this guy why did you go back to the hospital why did he die and then certain things are just like not even in the ballpark and maybe so old he'll be like we needed to get rid of them you know maybe the guy's dead I don't know but if I could find his killer have a real conversation with him it might set my mom free is really what I would hope it's just the interesting thing about this process this show is such a people have expressed surprised at the fact that we were making it as we put it out and I think that that doesn't even begin to touch on the like it was real live growth and real live emotion and things changing in my family week-to-week this is impossible for most of us imagined episodes came out at 6 a.m. on Thursday mornings and at 1 a.m. 3 a.m. 4 a.m. on every fucking Wednesday night Austin is here in the studio most likely with Kenny probably Zach making the ship before it comes out in like a matter of hours and Sam bear and bear are there engineer over the course of the Season you kind of go from being like to do this like holy shit two days like we're fine we got time okay let's try this one more days till after come out like it was not pre done that was not preordained that all things happened last minute or by Stroke of Luck everything from Ron Kuby coming in to save the day to that faint imprint of the undercover cops name on the police report and even basic production choices like what are theme song would be and also the theme song for the whole thing we went through so many with that because I was like really wanting to do use Billy's music that was a whole thing yeah so we had Kenny take some of Billy song we asked Kenny Cusack our resident composer and sound engineer to try turning a few of Billy's tracks and a potential theme song for the show here's one early sketch play some of that and you hear just how fucking wrong they are and I take total and I was the one pushing it so that's on that is not kind of candy was actually following the horrible Jackson that I was doing it but we were trying but when it's not working like pretty much everybody gets on board and it's like okay and it's not working let's try something else in like you had a relationship with Shannon I've known you less I know that song I love Shannon she's perform at the Bowery Poetry Club with my mom I think I just knew her from the village from like when I literally I was a kid and now people are like rediscovering light Asilomar first time discovering light asylum in like oh my God are they a good band to play some of their other music for yes this is one of my favorite light Asylum songs it's called IPC who wrote out so good but what they don't know is that the decision to use light Asylum happens probably a week before we launched the show in our trailer coming up we get into our favorite moments from making the show that's after

the studio with me Austin and our editors Zach like what what are some of your favorite parts of the show or favorite parts of making sure the fact that we got dancers like that's just so fucking I'm so proud of that like that's so insane we found the guy in the cowboy hat we got the police report we like a man to talk to us you know like we got we found his body all the things that I wanted to solve we solved which is crazy I mean I already cried about this in the credits but my relationship is Austin I'm not looking at him as I can but my relationship is Austin is like a gift that I will never do you know that's something for life goes through it yeah and I think there's there's just it's so personal in my mom such a character and and there's a you know I freaked out a couple times and had slyke's like a rational Panic about weird shit and just stick-in-the-mud about the wrong things cuz I was just having an emotional response out crazy this whole process was and like there's Austin just being like okay I'm going to take a walk and talk to you and like give you space to are your feelings and stay on the fucking phone with you for three hours while you figure out what the fuck is wrong with you and that is a you when you're dealing with something as emotional pain and Trauma connected as this whole thing was was essential to making it possible so I got Austin out of this what about you what are some of your favorite thing I love the heart Island episode the bird the Persian I said do you want to just leave you alone for a minute with them so you can leave me alone for just a few minutes maybe where do you keep / 4 aviary the birds okay that we have to tell them that the birds was Austin's the whole world to know I love the way you handled that interview with the guy in the cowboy hat who was intact but I love the way that that worked it was really a special thing I wonder if you're comfortable telling a little bit about like what you felt in that situation was that a rare occurrence or they're like happy being involved in something like that sounds bother you 9 pictures cost yeah I can't imagine anyone being happy about it obviously like 40 years and then he was the only one he's the only one oh my God like the fact that you are able to have the connection with that person I think made the show and in a lot of ways because I think of that goes a different way it's like not as and it would have totally been reasonable for it to go away because of everything that everybody had to listen to show totally understands but I just love that very much all right take care I love the ending I love like I think of that says like Tarantino like moment of seeing them like off into the sunset and I love that which was your GI we should get some credit here so it was that in the studio with your mom during that last sit down it all happened in the way that you heard in that episode you revealed to your mom whatever she wanted to know it was very tense do you want to know anything about the cop or any of that stuff I'd like to see him try and be six feet under all right that's that's it I mean side note I'm sitting here in this house video watching this happen and when she asked about his name what's his name you sure you want to know yeah I want to know why why do you think I could see you processing and I'm like ripping the seeds I'm like don't tell her don't tell her don't tell her I don't know I got to think about whether or not it's smart to get to tell you that that interview did happen the way that it happened in the last episode but Zack as is your role in this show to kind of supervised the the bigger picture structural things you had an idea to bring it back and end with the scene with Billy there's a story about you guys going to Boston but just like a beautiful thing it's literally them driving off into the snow sad I imagine her draped across the bench seat her bleach blonde head resting on Billy's thighs he skids through the snow a cigarette dangling from his mouth she reaches up and caresses the collar bones of the man she will love forever as they sing together freezing are flies up from the highway below but they're unfazed warmed by love come with me we knew when my mom sat down and she sang that fucking song I looked at each other and we knew even she knew and she said it would be more positive questions for like but I think that's a great way to end the whole show sure but that was not originally what we thought the end was going to be known as we were structuring the show as we were reporting everything we at where we were certain it was going to end on heart island with your mom in front of the great that's really what we thought until you took that trip to surprise you imagined you would always imagined that they would be this catharsis for your for your mom which it wasn't going to be in the studio originally going to be at her house which would have been a totally different thing and then circumstances shift again and now it's in the studio and now okay well rolling with that okay so it's like we're like they live ball and all of the decisions that were making our kind of like reacting to things are also being like President trying to like mold at the way we think it could kind of be going it's fucking fascinating process well I just want to say like none of the work that I've ever done has touched people the way this has like your openness and you're like the personal nature of the store I like the foundly impacted the people that listened to cycle these voicemails all these emails all lights crimetown but it's not the same thing it's not deep it's not as deep till I be a part of this thing that like was connecting on that level is really special because really really amazing to hear and see and read all these messages from people saying that it's like impacted them emotionally change them push them made them think about things you know affected me as a mother and her daughter and the phrase the past matters for your journey for the ultimate end goal is radically authentic presents with another person that just resonated with me with the past with my father and also wondering what it is that I'm doing in my own children I just listen to the fucking while in his car thank you I actually lost someone as well who is as the rest of my life and I realize that I listen to the podcast but I will love him Forever 21 wanted to thank you and your mom that vulnerability is the superpower I feel stronger than I was when I went into this I feel that vulnerability hasn't cost me anything but it was painful to make it but like I find I think you would be more painful to make something that wasn't vulnerable if nothing else from this story I hope that people take that that would be incredible ability and honesty in our time in the world yeah what's your life like now I am post Chow mylifenow involves a lot of desert and I have been remodeling a house in like building Furniture in it and I think that's like what I created to escape my brain mostly I drive around in my 1990 Ford Ranger pickup truck that has no AC what color is white and it's currently between 104 and 113 degrees daily in Joshua Tree but it's dry heat so it's manageable and I take my little dogs and I put them in my truck and I load my truck up with tools and then I go and I put things together and build things and like listen to weird murder I'm basically right back where I started Ender IO how is your mom doing how's Rebecca question my mom she's okay that's the honest answer is she's okay you know she doesn't have the context of what we were making she did not want to listen to it because it's not entertainment for her it's her greatest trauma and so I think there was a lot of kind of feeling like her most personal information was being put out in the world without her control and she's a kind of flailing around in the dark a little bit it was a moment though during the show so my mom has a version of my childhood that's different than mine where she thinks it was you no roses and peaches and glorious because she doesn't remember a lot of what happened and so my dad came in for his episode and he in that interview that was the first time he's ever owned the role of drugs in his judgment in my childhood so that really changed my relationship with my father and so she went to lunch at his house in the Bronx and he had a conversation with her and she called me afterwards czaban and said basically apologized for fucking up my childhood for the first time in my whole life and I was totally didn't know what to do I was like standing in my construction site in Joshua Tree just kind of like it's okay it's okay it's okay I love you I love you. Bye that is a moment that I have literally been waiting for my whole life and only happened because of this process but then boom she went right back into Tina Denial in the in the fear and irrational kind of outbursts so I think in the end she is better for the fact that I've grown through this process but if she could choose I would say she probably would not have done this although I don't know you know it's the island thing like we don't know how that affected her yet it's going to take time for that to settle in so I don't know how she's doing just like the show it's complicated and that's what makes you beautiful call so difficult wait wait so we never got to my favorite parts of the show one of my favorite parts of this was a lot of water and my venturing out to the city is being Knuckleheads and our first reporting trip we went up to the Upper East Side to talk to this woman that were calling Natasha E6 in the stands after that interview went got a sandwich Krusteaz that's our best bet he's really good and we are standing in line and you're like Ruth Bader Ginsburg is over there is it against for this year she was so tiny so small looks like Ruth Bader Ginsburg Ginsburg I think I know this was her I have the Instagram story posted an Instagram story of this little old lady and wrote RBG? I pulled the story back up in the studio tell me is that her and pulls up a real photo of RBG online this is her it's it looks like her the posture does seem like her this mystery must be solved can you see her rings anywhere is there a picture of like her hands anywhere because this person has on Tuesday to share of RBG that shows her hands look at all my God it was fucking RBG we didn't fucking talk to her or am I narrated her whole eating experience does it take away the tape free Creative Inspire just finished your soup cleaning up her tray she's cleaning the crumbs off her tray she's such a thing RBG just put on bright red lipstick like a boss somebody's coming to meet RBG an older man garbage he's getting up Che ah chi like soup groundbreaking investigative journalism I just thought his old lady who looks like her and I was always trying to think of my head of a moment when we could get that in the show I want to thank everybody who's listen to this show for all of your feedback all of your voicemails everything you've written to me online the response has been tremendous and it gives us all so much wind in our sails thank you I'm going to miss you crimetown is Zac Stuart pontier and Marc smerling The Ballad of Billy balls is hosted by me IO tillett Wright and made in partnership with cadence13 now you have to find me on the internet a mile loves you on everything if you want to know more about my story you can pick up my Memoir darling days we still have that voicemail line set up for you to call us I'm going to keep checking it so please call the number is 570-392-9660 truly it's one of the greatest joys of my life to hear how the show is affected you guys and your dad jokes this episode was produced by me and Kevin Shepherd our senior producer is the King Austin Mitchell editing Is by Zac stuart-pontier and Marc smerling this episode was spice and Bear music by Kenny Cusack now you know what that means are title track is dark allies by light Asylum thank you Shannon and Bruno so so so much you made this show things to Daniela Araya Rachel Lee write Emily Weideman who by the way are all of our girlfriends and wives green card pictures Alessandro centauro Bill Clegg Ben Davis or Ben Rosenbaum and the team at cadence13 and of course my mom without whom none of this would be possible
