is not at all friendly no discredit he feels bad about what he's doing so explain what just happened here well I can tell you I've only had about four hours sleep cheaply because I was a little nervous about trying something new I what I just did was I I clamped these two pieces of plastic it look like the monsters from alien look at those little alien heads under clamps you basically slide these clamps Auntie tray table and it prevents the person in front of you from tilting back and slamming it to your knees if you're tall man like I am the most inventive and the most passive aggressive Gadget he never heard of it's called the Knee Defender that's a tall guy flies two or three times a month for his job he decided he had to try them catching the pipe to the arms of his tray table with simple but next game be part that kept can awake the night before the makers of Knee Defender have something called a courtesy card that you're supposed to then hand to the person in front of you to let them know you're deploying the Knee Defender clamps so I I just tattoo women shoulder in front of me said this message is for you I'd says this is a Knee Defender courtesy card TM trademark I am using Knee Defender TM Knee Defender TM is a small plastic device that helps to protect myself by limiting how much the seat in front of me Kendrick on I wanted to let you know about this Melanie can check the box it said that her seat would be able to recline to in can advance care that handing this is somebody he was going to end up in some horrible argument with a stranger on a plane he's Canadian to put too fine a point on that he's doesn't like confrontation we discuss what happens next and remember as we discussed as we're sitting in the road directly behind the woman that he handed the car to hoping that she cannot hear us because of the noise of the plane which is louder than you might think so I had her the card and then I my hands were sweaty and shaky so for about a minute I just saw with paralyzed eventually she had me the card back and Slaton out of their head didn't say a word then I asked her a hair you okay with this and end that are tone change set a very cranky and said yeah you don't see me move my seat back to you Nintendo United against each other you wrote a little note on a piece of paper do you want to just read what it said yeah I read a little note you cuz I could really talk and my note said I feel like a total dick right now I see I mean how do you how would you feel do what you feel comfortable doing this hey now now we have something we have to start looking for Hughes in their behavior beyond the card that there are Jack I'll be like I'll be looking for extra reasons to hate them so yeah I can put it right now because hey I got some space here my knees feel good still being a dick yeah I'm getting away with it are you getting away with it in a sense that you heard Hurd chair is up but you're not getting away with it a sense of she probably thinks you're a dick absolutely true yeah this is not the kind of getting away with it the most was what most of us want Total getting away with it which means we don't just get our way in addition nobody thinks badly of us you know nobody judges that's what we want that's just as true that grown men as a little boys do you think you're going to use the courtesy card and the Knee Defender again I will absolutely use the Knee Defender again the card I don't think I'm ever going to use this again now I feel too bad so basically you're at your hope is going to be at the people when they try to push their CPAC who just going to think you owe the seats bro yeah yeah that basically I'm going to be a sneak be tricky let them believe the seats broken I totally relate to that choice I think lots of us would like this Snakes on a Plane if we can get away with something completely with no one ever knowing nobody judging us and Report nobody really hurt we give it a shot today in a program with stories of people making their way through putting one over getting away with it some people justify it by saying they're doing it for others for the greater good some not bothering with that they just don't care maybe dad holding marijuana been sick of this family we have you our listeners setting things on fire and cheating in school we have politicians lying and a wholesale and utterly effective way for the sake of four year olds to stay with us I can take your kid to work day customer support thing if you can get away with some kind of wrongdoing is it you have a plan a foolproof well-thought-out plan with safeguards and contingencies on the way to guard against everything you could think of it could possibly possibly go wrong has the story about his parents and others with the hall but marijuana through his early 30s he could do little with the trucking business he'd inherited from Grandpa Except watch as a crumbled around him back then he began his days by throwing open the door to the bedroom I shared my brother Dan Heat stand there in his underwear looking like a tall diaper child and say you to get up it would end the day drinking a lot of dollar 50 Budweiser set The Shanty bars that littered the port of Brownsville at home mom kept the bookkeeping she watched the flow of money slowed to a trickle and then stopped out right when I was in Middle School my brother sisters and I knew things were dire when our mother stop shopping at El Centro Supermarket the nice grocery store that she's always told us and started bringing home bags from Lopez Supermarket the poor people grocery store one morning Mom surprises me by showing up at my 7th grade algebra class and removing me getting us on the road out of Brownsville headed north there's no explanation except that they she snaps at me sit down and shut up I don't know why I didn't guess what we were doing that morning that Mom and I were Lookouts her dad who was on the road somewhere behind us and one of his flat nose tractor trailers carrying a large load of marijuana and headed north I had heard the stories new some of the tactics of smuggling by this point but I didn't make the connection that Mom and I were driving ahead of dad to make sure the custom station was closed and if it happened to be open we were supposed to turn back the Morgan this was back in the 1980s before the Patriot Act when they were to US Customs checkpoints blocking the migration of drugs fruit people reptiles and parrots are the roads between the United States and Mexico both about 100 miles north of the Mexican border at Highway checkpoints the station on Highway 77 in Sarita was the busier and a better financed the checkpoint in Hebbronville though was an Airstream trailer with an attached carport to protect the agent from the sun and it would often close for breakfast or lunch so we're headed towards that one this morning going north on Highway 281 driving through the scenery of asthmatic plants and stunted trees the car is hot no air conditioning my mom and I are saying nothing and one another we have each decided that the other is Unworthy of conversation we stare at the windows and think very different things mom is thinking about the $100 she and Dad hats bed before 6 that morning $100 that would help them make $2,000 if things went right because our first stop on this felony Excursion was to Dad's curandera whom we know as La Senora that's personal witch doctor for an emergency session they would let right through at 5 in the morning and I had only one burning question will the checkpoint be open after years of sitting through these sessions with my grandmother I didn't have to be there to know exactly how it went in the food under his office the signora is older matronly dresses in the thin frocked with her hair pulled back in a bun check my parents sit across from her desk in a black leather loveseat with chrome handles the panorama photos hang around her office some wallet-sized others larger and in portrait a pencil sketch of a Camaro by one of her grandsons xxtra window she listens closely to their question Notting sleepily at their preoccupation sympathizing understanding they reached a decision of the cat turned back they tell her they need to do it no other choice anymore she stands up abruptly and walks behind her desk which is closer with sheets of notebook paper crawling with ink illegible notes names of people sets of cryptic numbers home addresses of saints she closes her eyes and scribble something on a yellow legal pad nonsense to anyone else reading it on her desk or two cheap leaded crystal bottles each filled with a clear liquid she gently reaches for a matching shot glass and listen to the light making it Sparkle she places the glass on the surface before her imports from one bottle than the other when the two clear liquids mix they turn a deep crimson and thicken like plasma she nods her head as if her suspicions have been confirmed she produces a glass orb filled with water sitting on a black plastic ring Jason substrate closes her eyes and regulates her breathing into a loud rhythmic inhalation exhalation didn't consciously forces mom and dad to do the same after a few seconds she opens her eyes suddenly and Strikes the glass sword with a metal wand making it ring in the clear morning are then she'll Ipsy or between your two pudgy hands and stares deeply into the inverted image of the room around it sitting opposite this chicanery and watching everything she does your drawn to the ritual and you can't help but try to figure it out to no she says the certainty the checkpoint will not be open this morning go in peace God be with you when Mom and I reach a checkpoint at 11:45 that morning it is very much open for business a line of cars 5 deep stretches back from the under budgeted Airstream trailer our job now is to go through and then turn back around and report to Dad that is Doom was indeed imminent mom is visibly shaken she turns off the radio with a heart click and considers this considered her options from the car we can see a skinny middle-aged white guy in green border patrol Garb sitting on a reclining chair in the open doorway of the Airstream trailer he's facing the cars as they pass under the tin roof it must have been a hundred ten degrees inside the trailer a hundred in the shade from his position never bothering to get up the agents it's Fanning himself with the newspaper and sleepily peers into the car's asking if everyone is an American citizen waiting for an accented answer smiling and then waving them through like a sympathetic priest granting absolution hi we are going today that's the skinny little man mom's window is now only halfway open and her nervousness she rolls it all the way up high sorry I mean San Antonio as she opens the window y'all American citizens yes she says that she things back so he could get a clear look at me nodding my head I don't say anything except the quiet yep when I not but he has not heard me there's an uncomfortable pause I think because they're supposed to hear your accent there was an actual speech and he still hasn't let us go when I say yes I am a bit too enthusiastically mamas nervously she had been hoping our light skin would exonerate us without a problem y'all have a nice day he says like he hasn't noticed anything awkward we drive through and I filled her seat for the next few miles that was about noon somewhere behind us at a roadside rest stop dad and my older brother dad are waiting and Dad's tractor trailer which is attached to the trailer with a marijuana the two Center IV measuring the length of the trailer make perfect housing once you weld metal plates all along the other side and at the tail-end it creates a long rectangular box sealed at the rear end with the axle of the rig 20 40 lb blocks of marijuana can be in this is what Dad and dinner Cary I wondered dimly if Dan has figured out what he's doing out here on the road north when you should be in high school the dam is always been more StreetWise put severe than me I figured that if I figured it out cheetah figured it out long before Mom and I drive on to Hebbronville I'm dehydrated I want to stop at a store we can't she says to me we have to turn back I think we're behind still am hungry and really thirsty so I persist certainly we have time to get your convenience store the cats have scheduled this thing to hinge on a few minutes certainly they devised this more clearly than that please I played it just stopped at 7-Eleven grudgingly she polished the noisy car around the small town and find a convenience store I get out with a couple of dollars and come up short when I tried paying for some donuts and a chocolate milk I return the car for more money just get in Scheels and I do leaving the food at the counter mom wants the car around and I'm in trouble used to it by now wish I was like that for a few minutes and when the check point is back in sight we hold our breath so the guy won't see us and right then we see Dad and Dad and the trailer heading right for the checkpoint that'll become nervous or maybe Brave or maybe he was blinded by his hundred dollar faith in his good on that and I charge forth without waiting for moms report oh God my mother says it all the blood drains from my face from just a tone in her voice I've never heard her voice so charged with fear oh God she says again with her left hand she grabs an odd-looking trolls the headlights and flashes at dad was only a few hundred feet from the checkpoint she flashes 4 times in clear view of anyone who was paying attention I wonder if that is our signal at the checkpoint is open to question the wisdom of doing it while he's next in line in full view of the guy at the check point where he can look over shoulder and see the noisy southbound car that just drove through not 30 minutes before she slows down so it's terrifically down going less than 20 miles per hour on the highway and for a moment I can see Dad is driving I can see that the blood is drained from his face to making his eyebrow stand out a rich black on his pallet deathly wide forehead a mask of someone pretending desperately that everything is A-Okay but doing it horrific Lee badly I see down in the passenger seat holding onto the handrail above the door as a means to steady himself to do this craziness through this stupid unnecessary risk and he looks calm collected uncaring like he isn't there there are no cars ahead of them now the trailer is next in line it slows to a crawl and I could see Dad desperately trying to ignore the crazy flashing noisy Bonneville rattling through the southbound lane keeping his eyes fixed to the road pretending like he isn't smuggling anything at the empty trailer behind him this empty useless trailer with the IBM's all sealed up with the two Mexican men driving it with no obvious destination no paperwork no affiliation with any hauling or Trucking Company no sir not trafficking and rocks just driving through to Houston probably looking for work oh yes we are American citizens that's not why we're nervous we can prove that that's nothing we're nervous because of the part we're hiding and because we're only getting $2,000 for risking upwards of ten years in prison isn't that funny isn't that just a sterical but the skinny white guy is having lunch and can't be bothered is one of the weirdest moments of this whole debacle The Bonneville the Airstream and Dad's tractor are all lined up like some Cosmic event and we see the skinny border patrol agent with a white napkin tucked under his chin. Blood was face up in the trailer through the window of the Airstream as the agent waves I'm through with a fork like he's conducting an orchestra going through go on to bocaccinis driving South stunned by what has happened and I'm careful not to say a word we almost reach Raymondville and stop at a Whataburger to get a quick word with lunch and spend some time sitting in a parking lot waiting when she feels it is safe to return to turn the car around and head back North back to the same checkpoint are you sure this is safe I ask she doesn't answer when we pull up again to the checkpoint headed back to Hebbronville around 3 there was a different border patrol agent at the Airstream he is a small clean-cut militant Mexican with a Southern drawl you all American citizens he demands instantly leading into the car through the window clearly smelling for marijuana smoke oh yes says my mother who is probably quite relieved the hard part is over and it looks like we're getting away with it how about you son you American citizen he gives me a direct clear through reflective sunglasses there is nothing more potentially hostile than the indigenous ego interpreting the laws of his conqueror upon his own people yes sir I say careful not to move her fidget or look away like I've learned he looks back at my mother then at me like he smells the nervousness of earlier something tags that is intuition where y'all headed the sunglasses finally asked this catches mom off guard her subterfuge attended when data-driven through the checkpoint she left all her answers back in Raymondville we're going to Hebbronville she says I'm convincingly Patty ask one more question how do you pressed it we would have been in some sort of trouble but he doesn't any backs off emotions is through mom drives a noisy car through Hebbronville but we are about to hit the open Highway again when we noticed dad's trailer in the parking lot of a cheap motel by the side of the road by Brother Iz Dodge between the rearmost tire working on the brake lights. Ridiculously aren't working mom is as alarm to find them there as I am this confirms my suspicion that there had been no planning beyond the consultation at the codon that has this whole debacle have been based on nothing more than $100 worth of face bumbles back to the trailer and I think she expects the Victorious reunions when he sees her. Suddenly looks like he's about to punch her stupid woman yells at her in Spanish mom stops cold were you thinking if they would have just turned around for a moment it would all be over and it would all be your fault he spits at her in Spanish we realize what he's upset about the flashing headlights does words continue to snap in his around her like bullets in a firefight that she follows him forward to the cab of the truck kowtow enter punishment lucky for us message what I was right. Says walking back with Mom and I'm excited and seemingly over his anger she made him blind and we were left here like they were closed when we left them later that evening Dan was doing the driving they pulled out of the parking lot and headed off to Houston and their pay off the brake lights temporarily fixed and Dukes of black electrical tape iWatch is a truck disappears it looks like every other piece of no broken down equipment we've ever owned rusting miserable and totally Criminal mom and I turn South back to Brownsville mom is your usual quiet self except this time she plays the radio louder this means she's thinking it's getting dark and I'm sleepy so I sleep she'll get us home she knows the way for that I can trust her Domingo Martinez bring a story from his collection The Boy kings of Texas which is a memoir and a finalist for the national book award that to get away with it after the beep Today Show was rerun a couple weeks before it originally was broadcast we invited listeners to call into a special phone number that we set up here at the radio show and tell us what things you have gotten away with over a thousand of you called or entering back then listen to this message has he said that he came away from the experience seeing you all very very differently than he had before he said that if these messages are any indicator a tall best movie The cheating in school who committed some small Act of arson at some point in your lives so good to know I know we should try to capitalize on that during the pledge drive I have no idea how but there's a small selection of the messages we received but we did good night about Morse code on wood tap during class I buy All rights should not have graduated and I shouldn't have gone to college I got a way with graduating high school by lying to my being and telling her that I had HIV in the shop for your high school turned into stick for my final project that what I saw in the paper age which cake is between us entering the church we saw a giant earthworm on the ground in the parking lot of kick it up and put it in my pocket and for the service started my brother and I was playing with my brother dared me to put it in the pair of a girl in front of us and and I decided to do it and so I put it in her hair but because the hair is so frizzy it was the 80s disappeared and she didn't feel anything my daughter away with paying the featured speaker in a seminar to attend was not even invited I'd like to tell you how I got away with posing at the president's cousin to get Health Care at a hospital in Tajikistan to a girl trying to impress and I decided to write certain stop by at the stoplight so I planned on the accelerator and just as I was flying past her a cop is going the other way so he doesn't how to make a quick right down the side street hoping he'll chase a girl but of course you didn't he became after me so I need another quick write-up in the alleyway still coming after me feel like pooping behind a garage jumped out of my car ran through some people's yards cross the main street of Sherman Avenue and wondering what am I to do I'm not without a car and the police are looking for me lol I saw another cop cars parked at a parking lot of a professional building and and I ran over and I said oh my God somebody just stole my car thought it would be fun to try to make flint with her words with WD-40 and a lighter and purple Forest until I get back to myself I knew it was on you cuz I went back to the spot where we all I had smoke that cigarette with a friend and sure enough that part of the ground with black eyes like I feel horrible but I ended up getting away with it.

My sister will come meet you will drive there so basically, it will try to find a hotel that he was kind of excited cuz he likes crazy stuff but basically we didn't have that much we just had our ballet bags and a little bit of cash that we went to a diner we dine and dash and we stole things here like we made it Rockefeller Center cuz I just seen TV not nobody said are you girls lost nothing like that hotels wanted to be responsible oh my God so you got to come home with a guy not paying for it or try to hop on one on the way back so we try to hop on many planes but we was the flavor also crowded so we ended up having to have him pay for any made us pay it all back with her babysitting money there is no punishment know I know where this borderline child abuse Molly Shannon talking to Marc Maron on the WTF podcast which I recommend and what you can find on iTunes or through an internet search we spoke with the other girl in that story who has not talked with Molly Shannon the wild didn't know that you was telling that story publicly who confirmed all the crazy details in the story she says they held hands and prayed while the plane took off battery pack for pre k o 10% sex story which is definitely a story about getting away with it in a big big way I first need to give you some background about the preschool in recent years there been more and more studies showing the preschool is one of the best investment that a country can make in children's education probably the most famous piece of research on this is an old one called the Perry preschool project the study began in the 1960s they took a bunch of poor kids from Ypsilanti Michigan put half of them into a preschool program and then the other half you know just let their normal lives and then after a year of that both of those groups went back into the same public school system and then every so often researchers would follow up with these kids to see how they would do it the two groups the following still even now and the results have been amazing at age 27 the kids you got preschool were half as likely to have gotten arrested they under an average of 50% more per month it was 50% more likely to have a savings account 20% more likely to have a car preschool kids got sick less often one employed less often since incarceration less often other studies show similar results not just for poor kids but for other kids to they do better if they have preschool and the very first state to choose to make free high-quality preschool available to almost every four year old in the state and then actually delivered on that promise turns out to be a surprising one side only a handful of states have joined it Alex blumberg reports that the story of how the state came to lead the nation and preschool access is all about getting away with it quick reminder for we start today show is a rerun from few years ago since we did this story some details of Oklahoma's political landscape that changed the state is Oklahoma and to show you just how surprising that is consider what happened to guy named Ron Peters Peters was a freshman legislator in the Oklahoma State House of Representatives Republican Party leaders of the veteran legislator came up to him one day and said the governor also a republican appointed this task force to look into the issue of early childhood education they came up with some recommendations the recommendations were put into this bill the governor wants us to pass it will you be in charge of making that happen it was free Monday in Beltsville. Was it set up a public-private partnership silver frog Foundation dandiya was simply to set up a non-profit to publicize the value of early childhood education some more parents would consider it to be introduced the bill on the house floor I mean how do you say you know just a sector was going to raise money to fund the words program so I mean couldn't argue about since Penn State money but they said it will be the beta 7 handle my saw the island at the debate against it this is a nanny State build garbage going to come take her kids and Racing for us we think kids should be raised by their mom and dad not like that I thought was wrestling Mart in car night and I got the looks like just like who the heck of those people that were there so you think of anybody right after you hung I don't know know know but the whole bunch of them I got it passed and it passed the house passes in it and then all the people started getting Letters From The Far right-wing saying to the governor this is an estate Bill why we just take her kids from the hospital and take them to you the racehorse he got he got scared a little bit I guess and the in a beat on his own task force bill what's up I was terribly upset actually the governor only threatened of each other but it was enough to kill Peter's bill that time around and that is how unlikely it is passing Universal public preschool in Oklahoma a bill that simply suggest that the state might think it's a good idea for kids to go to preschool a bill remember that doesn't involve any state money and doesn't actually set up any new government programs that Bill gets attacked as socialism and scuttled Oklahoma is arguably the most conservative state in the country. A republican house Republican Senate Republican governor for out of its five representatives to Congress are Republicans as are both at Senators one of those Senators Tom Coburn was named the most conservative senator in Congress by National Review magazine and if you need more proof consider this Oklahoma was the only state in the entire country in 2008 we're not one single County voted for Barack Obama so how in the world did anyone get the conservative state of Oklahoma to agree to a dramatic expansion of the state's public education system in preschool Sunday that many conservatives would oppose how did anyone get away with that the answer Universal public preschool came to Oklahoma not as part of a bold evidence-based campaign We snuck in in the dark 80% of just how secretly it happened considered this rather amazing exact at the time Ron Peters was getting his little Bill squash by his own party in the legislature Universal preschool was already in place in Oklahoma vote in two or three years earlier Learn to Love by many of the same people who are accusing Ron Peters of socialism and what's more they had probably voted for that law without even realizing it which is exactly the way the people who brought public preschool to Oklahoma wanted them Story begins in the late 1990s that begins with a seemingly unrelated issue School superintendents around Oklahoma had discovered a loophole in the state school funding formula and we're using that loophole to run a little scheme that involve to kindergarten classes huge amounts of money to the scheme was it was legal in Oklahoma for schools to have either a full-day or half-day kindergarten program the loophole was that schools got paid the same amount from the state either way and so what school district begin doing was running to half-day programs and collecting twice as much money and if they couldn't find enough five-year-olds to fill to kindergarten classes they would pad their numbers with four-year-olds we got right in the middle that very very early Lloyd snow with a School Superintendent at this time who took advantage of this loophole ran to half-day kindergarten wrote a bunch of four-year-old got paid double from the state it was like I know rank did not want to be able to do this put it in play and then have money left over for other so desperately needed underfunded educational processes yeah I mean it was it was it was a good thing and we haven't had very many good thing good things in public schools in my estimation so I didn't blink twice other than the state the scheme spread four year olds were like gold in the extra money they brought in when everything from football programs to New School equipment even new building that's what happened in the district of Joe eddings state legislator around this time there was so much money came with these children the school district bought what we call a portable classrooms of the big mobile home you know that's it you pluck it together in the end it and you got a nice classroom but prefab here they bought the the buildings paid cash for them with the money the first year that much gravy and then from then on they got to use the buildings in essence free now I was happy about this but he wasn't the seems like a loophole that people were abusing and so for two years he tried to close it to keep four-year-old out of kindergarten we got nowhere and Joe and he become Central to the story of universal preschool in Oklahoma you'll hear a lot more from him later after he meets this next guy another main character in The Saga a guy named Bob Harper Bob harvison is a self-described corporate guy conservative suits tortoiseshell glasses he was for many years a senior manager at TWA and after that and executive in the oil and gas industry just a friends with people on the board of the Tulsa Chamber of Commerce in one day a bank or friend of mine that was the incoming president of the chamber brought me a piece I want to talk to you about a project we've been working on at the chamber and he said that started in 1990 did put together a little task force to evaluate Workforce Development issues because they were going through Tulsa was going through a pretty explosive growth. The banker friend explained that local businesses in Tulsa had a problem there was finding it harder and harder to hire employees with enough skills and abilities to do the job the chamber have been looking into the reasons for this for the colleges and universities not training probably high schools they kept working back to this notion of children increasing numbers of children not being ready for school this Banker friend handed Bob a cardboard box filled with research and reports on early childhood education said here look this over and see what you think we should do I working through this cardboard box of materials in a cubicle at the chamber they in the staff had accumulated literature on the subject and I became familiar with the Perry preschool study I do remember reading those that he's like was that sort of an aha moment we are reading like these long term effects of preschool with that what do you have in your mindset then as your abuser I tended to frame things in terms of my business experience you know I just thought you just sent to automatic Harbison said he thought back to his career in the airline industry wear it one of the worst things you can do is fly a plane with an empty seat but a kid who comes to kindergarten too far behind the testiclea that kid might never catch up cuz I can find that seat in first second third grade middle school and high school but the seat might as well be empty for the good it's doing the kids sitting in it and also he thought when you look at the statistics of what happens to a lot of at-risk kids when they get out of school day end up costing the government a lot of money man of incarcerated are on public assistance bad outcomes for them and for society I always thought about if if if there was a business or group of businesses and they had agreed to pay for all the outcomes they would be spending money on prevention cardboard box made a big impression on Bob Harbison who in his quiet way became something of a crusader for early childhood education making the case for it to anyone who would listen including sometime in the late 1990s Jo-Ann's Fabric Joe was this legislator he had this bill trying to close that loophole and keep 4 year olds out of kindergarten Bob harvison started making the case that we don't want fewer 4 year olds and public school we got more of them is Joe Bob harvison is but you know how smooth Bob harvison is it me and you know what I mean it I never knew I was being lobbied if I was being locked mean I just thought what is Bob harvison telling me the things I need to know which incidentally Bob harvison was telling the truth but that that was the key that that Bob harvison found me a willing pupil and taught me all I know about the four year olds the course of several meetings Bob shared with Joe the contents of that cardboard box on the studies and research project demonstrating the importance of early childhood education and Joe gradually decided that he needed to change his law and make it much bigger he would still eliminate that 4 year olds in kindergarten for cash scheme sure no longer good schools Packer concerns of 4 year old to get extra money from the state for the long side that you provide for an actual program for four-year-olds an entirely new grade fully paid for by the state public preschool then turn down Oklahoma had a very good pilot preschool program guidelines for choosing the appropriate curriculum and hiring qualified teachers but this program only existed in a few districts because according to end the state didn't provide enough money to pay for it and just as the state provided only a third of the money that was actually needed to run one of these programs Joe eddings plan was to take that pilot program and fully funded so that any District that wanted it could actually get paid to put it in place. There was only one problem is when it's probably no way it could pass no way the state legislature would ever agree to pay for a program like this so Jo-Ann's essentially. He simply offered his Amendment again the one closing the four year olds in kindergarten for cash the full only with some new language a kind of PS it would you propose a tweet the state school funding formula made it to that school got the same amount of funding for preschool that they got four other grades this wasn't that a massive overhaul of Oklahoma's Public School System but the actual text of ends Amendment look like nothing special the way you amend the bill the staff takes the sections of law that your amending and then write your amendments in underlined and lying out what you are deleting language and I just had a few words here in a few words are still there were the traditional and Powerful enemies to something like this budget Hawks and limited government folks which as I said Oklahoma might lead the nation in edin strategy hear Let It Go sleight-of-hand Drew their attention to the stuff in the bill he thought they would like and didn't mention the stuff they wouldn't I probably sat down at their desk with each Republican and showed him two or three things in the bill that I thought they ought to know well I showed him where it's keeping 4 year olds out of kindergarten we're saving enormous amounts of money you can contract with private providers and they love that that's all I said everything you said was true and the bill did allow State money to go to private daycare centers to teach preschool also his plan was voluntary School District in half offer Pre-K programs in parents didn't have to send their kids to one so it was entirely reasonable to expect that in the beginning at least not too many school districts would even take advantage of it and sweet to the funding formula that offer pre-k program and one other thing isn't that going for him this four year old and kindergarten for cash scheme it was growing and it was feared that the two biggest District in the state Oklahoma City and Tulsa we're about to get in on it head and says that compared to the sure Financial Armageddon that would be his bill with the cheaper alternative everybody could see that my bill was way cheaper than not my bill if you voted no on my bill and killed it you were going to have enormous enrollment of 4 year olds in kindergarten and this was taking an immense amount of money and all but one voted yes on the bill probably because it almost all his discussions with lawmakers about his bill and left out the main part you know the part about how he put the state on the hook to pay for an entirely new grade level can you almost nobody in any legislature actually reads all the bills and the number of people who actually understood Oklahoma school funding formula you could probably count on one hand and the strategy worked with a huge and costly expansion of the government's role in public education and a state more opposed to Casa expansions of government and perhaps any other in the country Steven. I was the director of an anti-poverty agency and a long time early childhood education advocate in Oklahoma he worked very closely with Joe Biden's to get this long written in past I think it's fair to say that the number of people that I understood what was going on in terms of the adjustment to the state aid formula that most certainly you could you could count the number of people that were aware of that on one hand if there had been if everybody in the state was aware of it what did have passed I don't know that I would say that I think it's likely that it would have passed basically if if you guys catching Schnucks position I would say he had that had the Fick that had the enactment of universal Pre-K not been done through this what I would call stealth campaign I think it's fair to say that it would not have been in breakfast the irony is now that the law is in place in Oklahoma that just adds evidence to the case for preschool researchers who study Tulsa's preschool kids say they enter kindergarten an average of 5 month ahead and map 7 month ahead and writing and 9 months ahead and reading and the games are even more pronounced for at-risk kid to get preschool Lloyd snow the Oklahoma school superintendent says he didn't need to study to show that you can see it the very next year after District started offering preschool I mean one year after we started I mean we had him department meetings and all kinds of stuff because our kid you'll have better word recognition letter recognition better social skills better hand-eye coordination skills better y'all just almost better everything as it relates to register for school so now we've got all of our kids or whatever background I mean they're voracious Learners now don't start me with that stop so I know my ABC's I nobody for most schools a game-changer that according to Joe Eddins the legislator who arguably did more to change the game than anyone else would not have been possible without the strange four-year-old kindergarten for cash scheme scheme that ends used as a smokescreen to sneak Universal pre-k through a skeptical legislature I don't see it ever being funded if you had that like other states do if you had to say here's a program that we want to implement here's how much money it'll take where you going to get the money okay you know it for you if you would have to have a line item appropriation nobody would have supported it except the young mothers and they have no political class what lessons could other states a other states when I try to do something like this prayer they don't have a prayer they don't have a prayer because it's expensive and they did state legislatures are run by people that don't want us they want to cut programs not add programs not everyone would agree with engines on this fact if you talked to experts the trend around the country is for more and more kids to be enrolled in state-funded preschool programs States has the versus Georgia Iowa Vermont in West Virginia are all hard on the heels of Oklahoma with preschool programs of their own and ask for Oklahoma parents says Lloyd's know the school superintendent I love this program and statistics across the state bear that out remember parents don't have to send their kids to preschool it's voluntary but I'm a 75% of the state's four year olds are now enrolled in public preschool however it arrived it seems that Universal Pre-K is here to stay in Oklahoma Alex blumberg is the founder of gimlet media the host of podcast without fail originally aired this story back when he was on our staff in 2012 Oklahoma's Universal preschool program still going strong Judas Popeyes MSPCA by Nancy Updike in Robyn semien with Alex blumberg Bank Calhoun Sarah Koenig Jonathan menjivar Lisa Pollock Brian Regional senior producer for Today Show is Julie Schneider national production of the rear under pressure from Jessica lessin hop Catherine Reitman dos2 Nelson's Matt Tierney special thanks to data Terminator Michelle Harris Bianca gave her and Brenda MacDonald our website This American Life.
