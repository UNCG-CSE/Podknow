  don't tell me start rules World News headquarters in New York this is The Daily Show with Trevor Noah ears Edition
  tonight is a 16 year old climate activist who sailed across the Atlantic because she refuses to fly on planes
  also on Tonight Show vaping will be in legal Lewis Black is here to save the future and one of the world's biggest drug dealers is finally paying off so let's catch up on today's headlines
  let's kick it off with some big news out of Washington because the vaping industry may be about to go up in smoke President Trump will propose banning all flavored e-cigarettes after the CDC reported at least six people may have died from vaping related illnesses check and we can have our you be so affected and I'm hearing it and that's how the first lady got involved and she's got a son together that is a a beautiful young man and she feels very very strongly about it
  she's got a son
  you mean the son she made with you
  how on Earth does Trump forget that he has a son
  is it the world's worst Dad it's like him and Darth Vader you don't
  at least Darth Vader claim his son if Trump was the darklord he would be like she is your mother
  false Trump for not being super eager to claim responsibility for a son I mean the dude has been burned twice let's be honest you know but back to the story back to the story the Trump Administration is planning to ban all flavored e-cigarettes which I think is a great move because these companies have been targeting kids right I mean to the flavors good mango Jelly Bean birthday cake for kids right adults don't flavor their drugs like I watch narcos there was never a moment where someone's like let me sample your product man yeah butterscotch I like it
  well 10 Democrats are gearing up for tomorrow's 3rd Democratic presidential debate 1 candidates will not be on the stage as figured out a way to have his voice heard in the race for the White House presidential candidate Ryan is trying a new approach to reach voters through the music streaming service Spotify Ryan released a policy album that people can listen to it has 10 tracks that included stand on gun control immigration and climate change its title on Spotify a new and better agenda might be a good way to connect with voters but it's going to mess up somebody's date night yeah cuz when it's Shuffle is on your Spotify you have somebody over you trying to set a romantic mood music the capital gains tax
  actually would it be funny if this actually blew up and then Tim Ryan have to quit politics because nice has the world's biggest music stuff are you going to be at the next debate know man I'm opening for cardi B
  yeah I just be on the stage like New York Make Some Noise if you like student loan deferment
  let's move on to some news from the world's about fast food and Technology a silicon valley-based startup it specializes in conversational voice paste ordering technology McDonald's have the technology understands different ordering at the drive-thru Safari run some demos at McDonald's test restaurants Yoshi McDonald's is going to use computers to take out the orders at the drive-through cuz they say they is going to be more efficient and honestly I don't know how I feel about robots working in fast-food complain if your order comes out wrong with no sir I want to miss roaches
  but I do appreciate McDonald's trying to speed up service for people with accents that's a cool thing you know the thing is I don't think accents with a problem at the drive-thru no slowing down with with picky assholes want to choose different things
  I got the number 5 just wanted the number
  and I am ended okay
  I will say this no matter what I'm in favor of McDonald's increasing the line efficiency because that means will give President Trump more time to spend with his wife son alright top storage
  the opioid crisis over the course of two decades millions of Americans have become addicted to these painkillers and after years of people demanding that someone be held accountable the drug companies are finally starting to pay a price there is work tonight of a settlement involving thousands of lawsuits tied to the opioid crisis Oxycontin maker Purdue Pharma has reached an agreement with 22 states that about 2,000 local governments over its role in The Deadly epidemic the company will pay up to 12 billion dollars over time with three billion coming from the Sackler family they overdo Pharma I will also give up control of the company you don't know about the story you know yes I'm happy that the opioid companies will have to pay but at the same time being misled sick people about how addictive than drugs were they also be to lift limit on how many opioids Doctor could prescribe and then now that they make billions of dollars off an epidemic
  The Corrs countless deaths pictures get to be like how about we give you some of that money back and we call it even I think it's bullshit I'll be honest and then when you got me. How about I break you off a hundred we call it even at the library card okay
  even though even though this opioid crisis has been in the news for the past few years the family who profited most from a lot of this Devastation has managed to remain fairly Anonymous but now with finally meeting the man behind the curtain for the first time we're now seeing and hearing from dr. Richard Sackler the former chairman and president of Purdue Pharma respond to questions under oath do you know how much the Sackler family has made off the sale of Oxycontin I don't know do you know if it's over ten billion dollars I don't think so I don't know
  what Thursday is over billion dollars
  it would be fair said I guess he made a billion dollars out of here man I guess you could say he's acting like you have to come up with his change when I did get that $10 from Grandma and I made 150 from the yard sale oh yeah there's a billion dollars from killing thousands of Americans think of how much we got that part and I got the library card at the library card
  and the site was that they aren't the only ones facing consequences for their role in fueling the opioid epidemic by everyone's favorite baby shampoo company has also been told it's time to pay up yesterday in Oklahoma judge ruled the opioid ravaged the state in order Johnson & Johnson paid 572 million dollars the judge said the company intentionally misled the public about the dangers of its drugs Johnson & Johnson stock was up as much as 5% since the company was ordered to pay far less than many investors expect it yeah you heard that right Johnson & Johnson stock actually went up after they were find 572 million dollars because they expected the punishment to be much worse they expected the punishments we were some explaining to do I was looking through your phone and who is this puppy you mad
  it is adorable you know I love puppies why didn't you tell me if the guys are all the puppy. I'm totally not having sex with you the puppy
  Southern stands the drug companies are going to pay a bunch of fines not even admit responsibility and no one seems to be going to jail which isn't saying when you think about it but just think about the prosecutors one for the city Hoffman to go to jail for Cheating in a College admission Scandal they want to go to jail for that but the people responsible for thousands of American deaths get to walk away with a slap-on-the-wrist operation but if you look at someone like El Chapo what's the major difference be like he's a drug dealer drug dealer took his money and he spending the rest of his life in prison if you think about it El Chapo really only made one big mistake you should have been a drug lord he should have been the CEO of El Chapo Inc
  we'll be right back

  welcome back to the Daily Show news story. Through the cracks newest black catchers in for a second we call Back in Black
  technology it's everywhere iPhones tablet here in New York City within even replace their old phone booth with giant screens and I'll admit it's a lot harder to take a dump in them but I usually figure it out the point is no matter where you look there's a screen and I think it's great you know what I was a kid all we had to stare at was that thing on my Uncle Harry's neck it was mesmerizing but surprise surprise the thing we like most is his bad for kids is a weekend did Jeffrey Epstein's an alarming report that every parent should see how much screen time doctor say is too much is a new danger that doctors are concerned about now all that screen time is prematurely aging their eyes and the Damage could be permanent that they cannot hold a pen or pencil because they lack
  hand strength and dexterity doctor arguing that
  time
  kids on psychotic junkies with or without phones haven't you ever been to a Chuck-E-Cheese bring out a pepperoni pie and see who doesn't get the shakes if kids are just becoming crazy now then why did I get a vasectomy 30 years ago but apparently kid having too much screen time is a bad thing so some parents forcing their children to take a vow of abstinence thousands of parents are taking a pledge to wait to give their child a smartphone more than 20,000 people that signed the wait until age pledge committing to wait until the 8th grade to give their child a smartphone the world around that's right kids get off your phone and look at the world around you
  you're missing all the hate crimes pollution and sweet sweet death by vaping
  it's always great to use your phone good luck with that if you don't introduce these kids to technology immediately they might as well be honest if I had a kid
  by the kitty wouldn't be out back milking a cow if you Shackled in his room beta testing his new blockchain IPO I don't know what the I just said what who cares
  I get why regular parents limit screen time really pisses me off is that the parents most worried about the screens are the ones you gave us those screens in the first place you might think Silicon Valley movers and shakers are consumed by the technology they create but a growing number of parents in the tech industry are restricting or Banning screen time for their kids to some of the people who made coach products one thing kids to do with a private Silicon Valley classroom turned its back on Tech more parents in Silicon Valley on your child screen time in some cases the addiction is so bad there has to hide the technology all together and sign a note phone contract screen to find for our kids but not for yours is Silicon Valley people don't get to Shield their family from the problems they created in fact every time they introduce a new
  brain zapping do smoke they should have to test it out on their own Bratz first hey Kids daddy made something that might cause cancer could you stare at it for me
  PLS Check Cashers need to stand by their own product that's why I love the Kool-Aid man not only is he Kool-Aid he carries around an extra strong of Kool-Aid just in case she runs out of himself now that's what I call Integrity Boulevard.
  welcome back to the Daily Show guest tonight is an amazing 16 year old climate activist who's solitary School strike for climate outside the Swedish Parliament inspired a global youth movements from Britain to New York City in a zero-emissions racing boats to participate in the upcoming Global Climate strike and un climate action Summit blazing Gentlemen please welcome to the Daily Show
  Welcome to The Daily Show thank you so much and welcome to New York City you came here on a zero-emissions boats and part of me thinks that's because you love the climate the other part of me wonders if that's just your Viking heritage why didn't you fly to New York City to come and you know speak at the UN and you know inspire people to to move forward in the climate change movements stop Flying because of the enormous impact Aviation has all the climates are individually and just to make a stand and the I am one of the very few people in the world who can actually do such a trip so I thought why not
  wow
  I mean I know I wouldn't do that as a kid and I wouldn't do it now but what is inspiring is your determination and what's inspiring is that it doesn't just affect of the young people it started to affect all the generations and Sweden in Germany people are starting to call at the Greta affect where people are taking more trained since you started this movement they said they they feel ashamed to fly on necessarily in Europe your mom is an opera singer and she stopped flying which means you couldn't perform the way she used to you sometimes feel bad that you can perform or or are you more excited that she's not part of I guess polluting the planet
  I don't care honestly about how she performs shape
  she's doing a musicals now so I mean she had to change career but it wasn't that big
  and the planet is the most important thing for you
  yeah I mean for all of us I think it should be
  why do you think
  why do you think young people are so focused on climate change now there's a definite disconnect between older generations and younger Generations when talking about the climate why do you think that is
  I mean I think it is because we in a way I feel like it is more I'm direct stretch I'll just feel like I won't be alive than anyway so screw it but if we actually know that's
  these consequences will face US during our lifetime and it is already happening now and it will get worse and so I think that is why so many young people especially care about this and the and of course they want us is nuts
  as it needs to be it's not as much as it needs to be people are still very unaware it's my experience and so we need to continue but you can see that you're among young people the concern is bigger what do you think people need to learn about climate change many people have heard of the climate warming up some people have a small understanding of what it means but what do you think is lacking in the understanding of this issue
  I think pretty much everything because I mean we know that something is wrong that the planet is warming because of increasing greenhouse gas emissions and that might lead to that's the ice caps will melt and the global temperature would rise and the they will be more extreme weather events and so on been think they don't understand how severe this crisis action is and it is because they have not been informed and I mean we are right now in the beginning of the sixth Max mass extinction and the people don't know these things up to 200 species go extinct every single day and
  people don't even know that we have for a 67% chance of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees we had on January 1st 2018 420 tons of carbon dioxide left gym it to stay within that Target and now we're already down to less than 360 if we continue at the same admission level as now we have less than eight and a half years until that budgets is gone according to the ipcc from the sr15 report and that is for a 67% chance
  I'm down
  wow 67% chance and we not even hitting those targets
  what do you think people could do and what do you think governments should be doing
  I think people should do should do everything but I think right now if I wasn't just one thing everyone would do it will be to to inform yourself and to try to understand the situation and try to the push for the political movement that doesn't exist because of the politics needed to fix this doesn't exist today so I think what we should do as individuals is to use
  the power of democracy that to make our voices heard and to make sure that the people in power actually cannot continue to ignore this as powerful
  you feel a difference in the conversation traveling from Sweden to America is is there a different feeling around climate change
  and I would say yes because here it's it feels like it is being discussed as something you whether you believe in or not believe in and out
  Where I Come From Where I Come From it's more like
  it's a fact
  so that I have to ask you this you sailed from Europe to New York City New York City is quite an assault on the senses
  when you come from anywhere else what is the biggest thing that is stuck out to you in New York City
  l i mean just everything will The Impressions everything is so much so big so loud and the people talk so loud here
  and because when you are on that boat when I was on the boat there is nothing that is just the ocean and the of course the sound of the Waves crashing but that's it no no smells
  apart from sweats but brights so I remember the first thing I noticed when I when I when we came into the Harbour was I woke up and suddenly it smells something and of course it was collusion with still something and that's
  and that was
  it was undescribable to go from this extreme environment you're disconnected from everything and everyone you only have yourself in the ocean and a boat supposed to New York and Brilliant description of New York it is undescribable and it smells
  so I can go to sleep after I'm excited for your journey I can't wait to see what else you going to do thank you for making time for us the next
  December 20th to find a register your local strikes go to Friday's for future. Org
