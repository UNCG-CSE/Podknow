funny how me and you guys are in a Dylan Jesus Christ how long is it literally drives around Los Angeles with his camera Anytime Fitness in the car and rolled down his window and your favorite DJ and you purposely ask people that he thinks won't say Dillon Francis and every single time most of the time it's one of those bits that I don't think David will ever give up now I always do it I love it it's so much fun on those bets I just I really looked at the reactions to the people saying DJ Khaled is the best until now he's a serious part of your life easier and I was like okay cool so I got down there and he's in a soccer chair like foldable chair and he has he has a fishing line on a fishing pole as a dollar bill on YouTube like I would throw the dollar out and people try to chase the dollar bill and I'd reel it back in because they thought I was a dollar bill on the floor I'm looking around like there's no cameras anywhere show me and he's like no no just tell me some fun what time is me and my me and my roommate Alex we went out we bought like it like those chairs that you would have it like soccer games did it for like an hour and a half is the most fun I do want to film

call the cash grab is that public scrap we are on a roll but it's it's where you do multiple shows in one night only on New Years it's pretty much you can only really do it on New Year's Eve you could go from east to west okay so Dylan Dylan will start on the East Coast on the East Coast so it's a going to be like 11 maybe 10:10 or probably be the better time 10 p.m. and then you take a jet to another place then play it out and then you go to California and play one last one at like 3 a.m. crazy Jason I love how you had to put a name I like it's called a cash grab any business that's a cash grab it's called a cash grab you're missing the point that's in the same three different shows there's no way that you three different shows in one night like that before in New York for an hour then what then you fly to you're probably fly to I would say Arizona play one show there at 12 you have to do like 9:45 wow okay well that sounds like it's cutting it real the Wes is it's now four hours you pick up 3 hours and you come get you back and then you land in an hour to go from New York to LA Live and a half, the Tailwind now baby okay listen Pilots over there but you don't do the math I want to hear it I don't show and tell me when you did it when we're 10 11 12 okay I'll have to look back just say it just say it so 10 would be somewhere New York you ring in the New Year at midnight New York you don't renew your there you really ring in the New Year in Arizona and then you would fly from Arizona which would be 45 minutes to get to someplace to play at 3 a.m. a heli playing Vegas maybe you could do the easier way would be like you would do Midwest and then fly to Arizona Arizona on the cash grab ya about how much would a DJ named X make you can't say I can't why what are you scared of no no nobody fucking possible huge DJs I listen to this right now and all I needs a little motivation from your cash grab that's all they need they should already know about that listening to this right now is there you can make up words of 300 700 maybe ml you can make on y9ur and where you're playing that's amazing and all you do when what is your girlfriend wants to go to dinner if I know you do here we go over here if I can sassy Sally always takes the girls side Scranton so stupid and jail is just a room what are you fucking talk another day everybody goes out that maybe for you cuz you go to like nice fancy parties and stuff but for married people who aren't fucking famous like you know you go out or wrong New Year's meant so much more to me when I was a kid every New Year's outcropping Mary every New Year's I would just stop my eyes out really yes lie every new years I had its bitter is bittersweet it's like I had so many good times this year and I'm bummed out there ending to see what it is let me start my photo collage on my MacBook Pro fuck you flip phone reset MacBook Pro you didn't have a MacBook Pro because I didn't have a phone to your homework back then are you crazy I'm just saying what are you doing for cash grab this year it's kygo on the phone what does 65 million dollars cuz I'm sorry I'm going to dinner with my girlfriends do people do multiple

I bet I've been before that I think might know I think my I think I showed up I showed up in the Tesla I know we got comfortable I was like okay, so bring the other day I was just on the phone with my personality how is his judgment it wasn't based in music the musical place a motherly Place Debbie's going to come out of from a musical place in somebody's been doing it for ya my lifetime and you I appreciate talent and potential you're making me sound so much better than no fucking idea what I was doing on that chest that's the beauty of the right I have written down here that you are named the sexiest man alive when was this maybe it's just someone left a comment on like a picture when you were when you were in the first to ring what was around was Backstreet Boys and it was an NSYNC NSYNC NSYNC drop that single Backstreet Boys who have been big in Europe for a couple years before that they came over and drop their first thing on so it was really that summer was cussing Backstreet Hanson was out and he had like Spice Girls come out that summer Hitman of the first summer around there was a little rivalry there you know cuz we we had met them couple years earlier and we kind of try and keep tabs on everyone else is doing and then we heard they were in our videos were both like black and white it was just there were too many but they beat us to the punch every time so they were the first ones on MTV and the coolest thing that happened to me on the show I think Sarah came into my room if you guys want to come to the next room or we're having some drinks and I go home and she goes so we went to we went to the share price of Maker's Mark bourbon whiskey or bourbon with the alcohol song I took a sip of bourbon and I mean I have to write off Sonos I couldn't tell. Just left it there in the we all get call does that there was just it's just that there are both of you it was all like the older people on Sat like in Nick's room was like four of us and it felt like I was drinking with like a camp counselors like it was so close and I was like this is so much more like laid-back but like I thought it was going to be that everyone was very nice where you ever think that they're just nice to you because you're the host just so sweet and I was like I was like to know how is like how everyone so nice here I wonder why I'm driving away in the Ferrari I wondering if I might not getting like the taste of like how people because everyone know but like to us like to like from what I seen from how she interacts people now everybody nice people everyone so sweet on the Shelf unless they're putting it up for us yeah I know I tap the bottom that it was a pretty darn good group of people was yeah it was a lot of fun but I like doing shows like this guy didn't know she'll call The Sing-Off for like five seasons and I like being around shows like this cuz I like being around young you know you're such a good because ability to it and I don't even realize I'm doing it but this is what I want to confront you about actually what the fuck is going on bro I remember the the Show wrapped up and you said you were going to invite me to your barbecue where the fuck is barbecue did you shave and you gave me a specific wife handles the invitations from socks and I slipped her yours Labor Day I was happy I was David I promise you the neck the next get-together we have my house to do with your clothes house on Labor Day sure I was having the best day of my life but you probably running around doing something about there's something about Nick that is so like a reminds me of like my hometown Nick's Barbecue or anything. There's something like very homey about Yu-Gi-Oh so I was like I cannot imagine what his butt cuz of this barbecue must be like our guy grilling for that is because there's a Holly's a wicked Halloween party coming up on make sure that you're invited to how many people show up to this party I'm so 1 blowout party we do every how long have you lived in the place you've been living in 3 years 3 years I could you move a lot I do social media two different things to me because it's like what do you do differently but you're in in the best way possible you're the least celebrity celebrity I've ever met like you're like the most chillest like that's why I was so excited but such a normal present first question to David outside and whenever I sit and talk about like my career and I will be starting I'm just I'm really fucking lucky I consider myself lucky to be 20 some years 27 years ago you said no but that's that's that's the dream to be able to do something like this how did you meet your wife we might do and we were co-hosting because right code judging Miss Teen USA contest maybe could be a know what the future holds see you guys were coaching a workout plan she has two dogs are allergic but really only thing holding us back I'm sure the dogs can go somewhere I was married and she was in a relationship and she just gotten the gig is be a VJ on TRL so all day with him just words that I say that aren't around anymore like one time one time we were talking about hiring a writer and I slipped up and I go yeah we'll have a guy facts in jokes like that six packs and I can't believe BJ's of thing that we are all the time at see your how you doing I'll probably keep in touch with you and Siri when every time I go there and then I got divorced she was out of a relationship just one of those things were just like it just lined up and you would always know each other we always been friends but we never know that was so interesting cuz I know like the Pony Express send an hour I've had a single coming out the time and I thought what better way to get my video played on TRL and asked what are the DJ's on TRL to be in my video so I asked if she wanted to be in the video and she said yeah shut the video and that's kind of been is it is it do a lot of people get together and in the celebrity world do they get together just to be just for press like garlic is that is that I feel you don't have an insight to this you don't have the secrets are you in the Illuminati did you ever have really bad diarrhea before like I shoot Stadium show or anything like that all of us for like this might be the night gosh I mean not slip and fall in a handful of times they had to share that with words you forget the words to your own songs and it's ridiculous parking lost my train of thought just thinking about Nick not to my knowledge but I'm pretty I'm pretty sure if it happened to my friends and that we were we were playing listen I did it for a good reason and I almost did it on purpose if you have to ask me I was very young I was 19 at the time I was like 12 or 11 and we are playing we are playing Mall tag and God damn it before you play tag inside the shopping center so basically we play tag and we are all sending the elevator before we all ran off and my friends are having a farting competition so I joined in and I mean you went too far out you know I did I take things I take xtend extreme and I ended up winning but I would say so I went to go to the bathroom and then I went home without my friends knowing that I went to go change and take a shower and had no idea where I was and I was the last one to be caught and multaq so I won twice that day as the best victoriously but I have a good reason what's the biggest crowd you play 2 what's the weather in a couple like shows in NASCAR tracks and had to be like 60 70,000 people are some NASCAR tracks and people performed out the Southaven that is fucking cool music for tires on a car that's been have you been there no I'm not I leave the country do you know this about me is all right yeah you know what the Years cuz I wasn't born here as in I'm going to Trump like really fuck me on like everything so I can't leave basically some stock did you not listen to what I just said where can people find you if they want to look you up in the Zodiac American Dad Nick Lachey Instagram Twitter come out hey David was a shark mouth but it's a good time we have thank you to Nick Lachey make sure I follow him and everything he is the sexiest man alive so sexy I'm David that was Jason this is going to be spanked a sauce and it's going to go over by okay bye
