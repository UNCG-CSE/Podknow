want to know how to break into the fashion business are you wondering what trends were sitting in the industry or maybe you're just curious what goes on behind-the-scenes When developing a clothing line today we're talking about fashion I'm very excited for this chat not only because this is my profession and something I'm extremely passionate about but also because I can't wait to share some actionable tips about how to break into this field I took a really untraditional path for my career and my guess today had a more linear one so hopefully hearing from her will help you on your journeymy guess today is a design director with 12 years experience in the industry she's worked at Kohl's for the past five years on the LC Lauren Conrad brand and she also recently helped build a few other brands that the company is about to launch her name is Courtney Kerwin and I've really loved getting to work with her she is an incredible I and I'm really excited to share her vision and story with you today I think about just items or outfits that never go away just looks like looks at just are a Timeless and season legs and just are always going to be classic things like a white tiene moto jacket back to like a great pair of denim that sort of look in the items at support that look those are always just around things like all white dressing you know those types of Trends they're just they're always going to be cool there always going to make you feel great from our conversation you'll learn whether education is important to build a career in fashion where the industry is at when it comes to size inclusivity and whatAli take to develop a collection welcome to Lauren Conrad asking for a friend Courtney and I were together for about 5 years and she happens to be in town we're at our house in Laguna because we trade off every other month and every other month I go to New York and then come to Laguna and we do all of our design meetings and are working sessions so that's that's why Courtney's in town like Amy is it is it is got some sunshine okay so the first thing I want to talk about is sort of your story and how you got your start and one of the many reasons that I'm really excited to talk to you about this is that it's the thing I get asked about the most and haven't asked about the most over the years and my story is a really unique one just because I was given a platform by being on television and I just it was always a little different for me so I I struggled a little bit with giving people advice because I was like I don't really know what the traditional roots it's like so I wanted to talk to you about going to how you got your start and maybe even like what kind of pushed you in that direction so we think you know I knew early on that I wanted to have a job in the creative industry I didn't know for sure if it was in the apparel industry but I knew I wanted to do some sort of design from really early age you know I remember being you know really interested in art and design in high school and just not really sure what I wanted to make of it so essentially you know when I was in school I started exploring my options and I ended up going to fidm so I went to the same college that you did actually in the Fashion Institute of Design & merchandising I didn't know that yeah so I did my first year in Orange County and I do my second year in Los Angeles and two I know it's so funny it's so funny what did you major in when you went to feed him so I majored in fashion design majors in fashion design okay I did product development the reason I picked product development is cuz I wasn't sure where I wanted to end up I was a girl I want to be a fashion designer but I didn't know exactly what that looked like so I did practice elements they said it was sort of the you got like the broadest range and end you I learned about marketing I mean like I had a speech class Yeah by 100% drops a thank you. So funny is I would like when would I ever use this but you would use it because you present during all the tigers at the collection so it's funny it like there's certain things in school I don't know if you thought about this but I was like there's no way I'm going to use this but it does make sense you're on me to get into the industry cuz a lot of people going with expectations I like what is this going to be like and you just can't really imagine it to you there right yeah I know it yeah I think he know I wouldn't say at the end of school it was you know I had my craft fully developed or I knew everything I needed to know like after school is when the real work really starts and that's when you know take all of these foundational things that you learned in school and then you start applying them to your career and really putting them to work yeah I'm a believer of learning on the job yes even turn you know what I never actually interned but I really believe in internships you know if I've had a lot of interns myself it's about my career and I think it's such an important part of you know getting your foot in the door and really broaden your perspective and seeing like a great snapshot of behind-the-scenes what goes into the fattest a career in fashion because there's so much work that goes on and you really see the reality of it come to life and you see you know just how much work goes into developing a line and watching a creative team work together and how fast pace it is so I think internships are great but yeah and I actually never did find myself which is kind of surprising actually as I told I did I did I interned in a couple of showrooms so I experienced sales I did a PR agency I did magazine which was it was a smaller one cuz it was like during filming so it was kind of limited but I still I got I got to see so many different things and so we having it all within the industry but they all just like took such they all require different skills and different interests and for me and turning was sort of like a trial not so much like it wasn't necessarily about like them hiring me it was more like am I interested in the right when I was like I'm not like for me mac the magazine industry and it was I don't know what was that for you to kind of realized right away you know and that's what's great about interning as you can just see you know there's so many different Avenues you can take in fashion and it gives you early on an idea of okay yes no yes no this is for me this isn't and then you kind of can just keep moving forward and find your own path are you involved and I called has a great internship program do they really do during summer or is it it's it's happens in summer and then fall through I think it happens two times a year okay yeah it's a great program though so are you involved in the hiring at all I do yeah I am I do a lot of the interviewing I got to be involved in the interviewing process there which is really exciting so I get to meet with a lot of the candidates myself which is great so if you're I've only done like a handful of interviews for different jobs throughout my life I've conducted interviews and it's like a weird thing cuz I feel like I've interviewed I've been the interviewee more than the interviewer ask people questions what are you looking for when you're sitting down with someone I'm looking for someone who's passionate who's highly-engaged who you know I mean personality definitely plays like a little bit of a factor in the cuz you want to make sure it's right fit for the team that you're looking to build or the brand that you're looking for them to be a part of it but I think just someone who's engaged focused passionate who is able to package their ideas and articulate themselves really well when it comes to their work because that's something that's a skill that you just in the industry need to you know really need to be comfortable as and you need to be able to you know everything that you do you have to present so how you package your ideas is such an important part of your role as a designer so I definitely do look at the portfolio how they're absurd of presenting their work yeah it's the first thing you mentioned was personality because that's honestly the biggest thing for me I think as long as you're willing to learn I never expected in turn to to come in like fully prepared and with all the knowledge that that's why they're there of course but just like someone who's really like a team player and they're just there do to be helpful and to really experience the job that's always more important to me than someone who's like really qualified but right be like I don't know GIF brings like a weird energy so yeah I always give people that advises I'm just like just just try and beat you know really positive and an easygoing and that's going to give you yeah I mean that's everything right we when you're interning it's all about just being open and absorbing all the information in front of you and you know having the personality that is you know able to do that and just be really positive and be a team player along the way yeah I think it's also you have to sort of be humble a lot of times I will conduct an interview and then they sort of say like oh I'm here just like almost like already above the job and you're like oh no I'm not asking you for a fever every time I'm asking you to do something like that the job right they got at a stove small exactly I think that's the attitude you want to be helpful definitely our kids are the future and it's our job to prepare them for that so why not Empower them to be creative confident and fearless and all of their Endeavors with kiwi Coast Innovative projects kiwico create

somewhat of an understanding of what goes on behind the scenes when you're developing a line but it's always it's really interesting to me like how fast-paced it was like what I see when I started working with Kohl's like it's a it's a very large well-oiled machine but it's just so many moving Parts it's crazy do you want to give like a really quick description of like start to finish how you would desire a line and when I say a line close has monthly collection so do something when you do so I think you know when I think about the process of developing a collection or align the the most important thing to start with is a really Clear Vision right you have to really invest the time with yourself thinking through with your fist yourself your team with you thinking through you know what is it that we are trying to achieve what is the story we want to tell and it just putting the right amount of energy into because without a clear InFocus Vision the rest of the execution of the line is it can be really challenging so I think for me but such an important part of the process and it's something that we do so well where do you find the most inspiration is it you know just kind of paying attention to what trends are out there on the runway and high-fashion is it entertainment is it yeah is it what what is it that usually directs that there's different sources of inspiration number one is always the customer we're always looking to our customer for inspiration whether it be how she's wearing the line what she's fine when she's not buying so she is always number one second is you know we pull inspiration obviously for much is happening at retail at large and having your finger on the pulse of you know this is a tapping in the market and set the trends that we're seeing showing up this is how we're seeing color evolved how we're seeing you know outfitting shift and the way that you cool. Inspiration is comes in multiple facets it comes from you know shopping internationally it comes from paying attention to what's happening on run away to pay any attention to what's happening commercially in retail and then also you know being analyzed the designer of paying a lot of attention to just your own intuition and noticing like what it is you're responding too and really paying attention to what feeling that evokes and analyzing okay you know I might be looking at something and it makes me feel a certain way I'm gravitating towards it because of the color or the print or the pattern and really spending time looking at that analyzing it and yourself why and then applying that to your work yeah I feel like a lot of times you pull like artwork or like photography and it sort of pulling the colors out of that and creating a story that way and I should mention that not only are you doing this you're also having to take into consideration The Collection that delivers the month before and the month after and making sure that there's a flow there so you can't just have like a random story every month you're also like you're like being creative and you want it to look different in fresh and new but you wanted to sit because the reality of retail is that like nothing it's not the entire collection sells out in the next ones delivered like there's a lot of crossover so it all has to like nicely said together but stand apart that's what we've been challenging me to me I was crazy as we're working on so many different deliveries all at once and then you know isn't it I always find it I never remember what year it is because it's you know we're working on spray or I'm so all of the deliveries to start overlapping no no yes and then also when I come to New York and I'm doing all of my meetings all at once every every category has a different time lines are parallel right about this is that right yes so I'll go from your meeting and apparel to like handbags or shoes which have like a really long lead I'm so I'm always asking what year were talking about cuz I wanna make sure like things are aligning that's one of the challenges I have always faced like when looking at the collection is a whole as you want to make sure it's always cohesive each month but everyone's developing a different times and it's like you don't necessarily want to have like shoes lead the apparel but then also like shoes has a wider collection it's all very confusing when you have to have we have to build their Peril concept for the shoe line even get started being the I mean yeah yeah you so there's so much you have to think about okay so you've developed the concept you've made your Beautiful Boards you have the fabric swatches you've purchased artwork which is always really fun to live on his part right. That works and may you think that to those who never been in a meeting like that it's basically a different Studios that come with giant suitcase and they have just like hundreds and hundreds of other little friend like to buy two pieces of fabric that they flipped through and you flip through all this artwork and you pick you up you purchase artwork from art best to use on your garments and sometimes it's your even like buying a piece of art for like a single flower sometimes you love everything about it sometimes you're like this is beautiful we have to change every color like it's just such a thought and I don't know those are some of my favorite meeting it's important part of the process right the artwork and oh yeah it's like you know it really does it speaks for you when you're not there to sort of speak to the DNA of the brand when you're walking to the store and you know the clothing is there the art in the color is heard of the voice of the brand right if you think about it that way so it's so important to make sure you're getting that right and that the motifs in the color and that the use of pattern really captures the essence of yeah you're trying to achieve I don't always understand like how much that goes into that right like for example this year animal prints were really big and so like as a brand we have to look at that and say how do we interpret that like we're not going to do like a classic leopard print wedges us but we can do like a micro leopard in like nude and blush that you like barely see it's more of a texter but we're still addressing the trends the right leg and even just like the medium in which the arts created to like we're always going to look where we going to love like watercolor is in more painterly interpretations of florals where is like other brands are going to do like pop your graphics yeah I just the artwork is so important and and we have so much fun looking through it so then what do you do next you got it all so okay so yeah you have your vision you have your art then you start sourcing are Fabrications right so I'm not a part of this cuz this is the least fun I did I did I did my time with sourcing and dealing with minimums and all of that. So it's a lot of work but so then it's just about okay so we have our vision it's clear we know we want to do we have our art and color directions and now what materials do we need to then bring that to life so we're going to sourcing Grand materials and doing some component building whether that be you know for loving you know the idea of embroidery or I lets you have to start working on that earlier versus some other types of materials that take a shorter amount of time to produce or develop so you know we need a good we go to that part of the process and then we know once you got all of your component tree back that's when you start sketching into the line you piece of everything together and then when you say sketching into the line yes a lot of people asked if if we still sketch everything and yeah yeah I mean no way I was going to say I was like I don't think we did we decide to sit there and sketch everything by hand. We do commute like computer sketches we do everything in the computer yes and I just I think that that's like such a beautiful image of just like sitting that it's it's like what you think of it like a Christian Dior like designing his lines right beautiful sketches when really we're doing like Flats on a computer right I mean I think so in the sometimes you'll do little scratches on your iPod I like when you do that when you take the but that's just how I do that slightly yeah I think because we work so quickly it'll be you know if you need to do hands get quickly to get like something out of your head out to party for I will do that but then yes all of the all of the sketching is done in the computer we just we just moved so fast and I need to do that in order to you know get the sample develop correctly alright see you got your fabric what's next after Fabric and then we talked we merchandise we strategize what it is we're looking to you know we're looking to do as far as you know by category so we'll decide okay how many woven tops do we need for the season how many knit tops and then like you said how do we want to evolve those and then we go pen to paper and just start sketching into our ideas and then putting them into Tech pack and then put all the design details in there so it's it's basically a recipe for our vendors as far as how what they need to know in order to actually create the Garment and make the Garment so was sampled this sample the starting point so so it just causes all of the really detailed information that takes a bit of time to build yeah yeah but very necessary necessary sample horse and a really good for a sample is just check EFT it really is like, then you're like oh yeah that's exactly what I meant where is like most of the time when you send a text back it comes back in a fabric which isn't necessarily yours oh yeah yeah we would get like like a penis I know most of us understand why it's so important to use natural products in our home but where do you find them wouldn't it be nice if someone would just curate all of the highest quality natural non-toxic sustainably-sourced items you need introducing Grove collaborative Grove collaborative is an online Marketplace that delivers all natural home beauty and personal care products directly to your door they aim to make living a healthy lifestyle easy and accessible for you and your family every product they sell is guaranteed to be healthy effective eco friendly and affordable so you can shop with confidence knowing everything you buy from them is good for you your family your home and the planet Grove collaborative wants to make it as easy as possible for you to make the switch to Natural Products so they carry the brand you know and love like mrs.

A little bit that was crazy how did they let us do that I don't know attract. I ain't like that slip through the cracks someone like suggested and it just sort of like. Bowling that was so fun I remember being know that dayveon like how in the world did they let us do a fashion show it was huge as it was and it was really cool and I'm not taking credit cuz I know that a lot of people were on this trend but I thought it was really cool that we had a runway show that was immediately shoppable yeah that was amazing that was really cool. A lot of people are doing one of the first people to do that we were we were just crazy I mean weren't the first but we were the new show yeah but yeah I mean that the whole that whole process is absolutely incredible just you know where they just like thinking back even you know scouting the models cuz I got to see when you were like picking out all the models and styling it head to toe working with the stylists taking all the behind-the-scenes you know photographs and still have sound under my desk so I just moved us recently I found on the boards that we had that had each model with the owls are all the looks into the boards I still have those in my desk. I just smiled and I found them never get rid of them to get rid of them tell me I'll take it I would know I did I would love to have that on my wall don't ever throw that away other great yeah that was a really that was just like a it was a pinch me moment. I really cool that Kohl's let us do that yeah that was awesome that I want to talk about just industry-wide I thought this was so interesting and it made me really happy of all the like looking at all the questions that I got sent in on social by far the biggest subject people wanted to talk about was eco-friendly clothing which is great I love that like what a topic this is becoming how important it's become to a consumer it's obviously something that we've we've been working on and we have some really exciting stuff coming up but it's just I think that is an industry we've been talking about it for a while but it really at the end of the day you know as I know it comes down to a consumer and what's important to them and what they're going to purchase cuz really they decide what's in the market so I want to talk about that for a second and you I mean I can kind of highlight causes a company is actually a very green company and that's part of what makes him a great partner and I think they don't really get credit for it cuz they don't really call it out there's a lot of big companies that don't necessarily call out there green initiatives they just kind of do them and you can find if you can do a search online you can find some of their stuff but you know some of the things that close to their bags at the store a lot of them are made up of recycled materials hundreds of their stores have solar panels and like getting up to like 50% of the power comes from solar and they do a bunch of stuff they won tons of award so it's it's a huge Initiative for them and it has been for a while but we've actually start doing some of it in products for example we this year released in organic towel that we really pushed for and it came out and it's been doing really well which is so exciting cuz anytime a customer votes for it then we get to do more of that which is really cool and you know not only is organic you know better for our planet but it's also better for the people harvesting in the materials cuz they're not dealing with chemical so it's it's sort of a win-win for everybody and then obviously you have an organic product in your home so we can talk a little bit about some of the stuff we're looking at yeah yeah I know this is such a hot topic cuz it's important and it's 6 it's really exciting to see you know how the industry is making some big moves and ships and how they develop and produce their product I mean we're always looking within the LC apparel line four ways that we can you know two things a little bit differently when it comes to you know even sourcing are raw materials that would be recycled poly or you know organically sourced cotton it as well as just within the development process what we can do to reduce sampling it's things like that that that that I think are really exciting and and I've just talking to different teams it sounds like within the industry like when everybody sourcing materials that is but I don't again I hate calling it a trend but like that is like the big thing that's on everyone's mind to like they're like all these companies are offering eco-friendly options and even a everything from like the way the materials are created and Soros to the use of recycled materials which we've actually we've use recycled materials in our line so yeah it's really exciting and I think that it's just one of those things where I like he want to encourage the customer to continue to support that message because you know as that's exciting. The direction we want to go in and end this again with a very popular question was just size inclusivity so a lot of people ask this and maybe I'm I'm failing by not making people aware but we do offer plus clothing and that's important to us yeah definitely yeah so we offer plus and petites both available online to go on kohls.com you can find a full selection there yeah and that's really important and and again a lot of people were kind of asking about that and it always comes back to the consumer if you have brand you love if you have a retailer that you love cuz sometimes the brands offer up but the retailers are necessarily buying a let them know say I'm interested in this I'm a customer I'm here to buy it because at the end of the day like we're here to create whatever the customer wants so never be afraid to speak up and let people know that there's a need or a want there because I've been coming I know it was really important to us to be able to provide you know full size run and be really inclusive with hellofresh America's number one meal kit get easy seasonal recipes and pre-measured ingredients delivered right to your door all you have to do is cook and enjoy

take some questions from you you'll learn how to get started in the fashion industry whether you need to know how to sew to work in design and why there's so much inconsistency when it comes to women sizing Katie wants to know if you know how to sell I do know how to sew I mean I have it let it I hope you haven't done it in a while but I was thinking about actually getting my sewing machine out of storage and starting to cycle again but my Brother sewing machines that we learned on his school the really high power ones we had to like put your foot down and garlic sew a button like repair a tear I embroider does that count I can't have definitely can I have a whole garment like I'm like a needle and thread I don't think I could do that now I mean maybe back in the day right out of school but now they think I can make a pillow neck pillow was that wants to know what are some friends that never really go away like what are things that we're always maybe it's not every season but it's like a really eat like a wrap dress right as a good example like that's never going to go anywhere I also think about just items or outfits that never go away just looks like looks at just are a Timeless and season last and then just are always going to be classic things like a white tiene moto jacket back to like a great pair of denim that sort of look in the items that support that look you know those are always just around things like all white dressing you know those types of Trends they're just they're always going to be cooler there always going to make you feel great a wrap dress is another great example of a good Blazer like the perfect Blazer definitely yeah I think it's it's trends like that they're going to the Silhouettes are going to shift through time so that Blazer it's going to be shrunken it's going to be oversized or do you mean it's going to kind of change at with the trends but it's still there is a statement yes like a black pump Journey mean right or the perfect black dress yeah like the shape might change Orleans yeah they send the trend in how people are addressing but the idea that you know that trend is going to just stay up forever Jen wants to know why pockets are so sorely missing in women's clothing took a question I also think you know have you ever noticed the pocket bag the size of the pocket bag in women's pants is what is really short so tiny quarter I know it's and then you know guys can't they have like the longest time ever I mean that has to do with the way your fitting the Garment right because it's flat it's more flattering to have a smaller pocket bag you know on app and then it is having a bunch of fabric do you want the gene to fit you well at the pan to fit you well and then you know the same goes with like the reason maybe isn't as many pockets on women's clothing it's because the place it might be off or you know the placement off and off and hits right at the hip right so I mean I've altered clothing and have pockets removed white denim I always have them taken out cuz they show crew I just sew it shut and cut the every pair of white denim in my closet is for my own line and I'm very fortunate because when we shoot it we have a tailor on Selena's how do I cut it out can you just cut the pockets out real quick it's always a pleasant surprise egg when I have a full skirt and then I find a pocket I'm like oh cool but the reason I guess the simple answer that I would give is that it's usually hits in an unflattering spot or it's costing right it would cost more to have PA yeah I mean if you can spend more money on a greater like a good Fabric or a better quality fabric then he might have to lose the pocket so he's our sisters compromises you have to make I'm so sorry Jen there's not a lot of pockets in our stuff Katie says women's sizing why is there so much inconsistency so I think she means like from Brandy Brands like that can't be right I mean we'll see each brand fits on its own fit model right in the fit models are provided by an agency and the way each brand fits their garments might be different because of the ascetic so we know within our brand we want everything to be comfortable we wanted to be versatile we wanted to have like the perfect amount of ease and just the right places so that's how we fit our clothing and then another brand might want things to be a bit more bodycon or a bit more you know low-cut or I don't know whatever and so the way that you know that brand fits their garments is going to feel a little bit different yeah everyone has a signature fit and also I've I've experienced this I'm sure you have as well like where bran clearly got a new fit model that had a completely different body type because like all the pair of jeans I buy for a couple years and then I go to buy the same pair and thus it's completely off and they're like whoa something happened to their yeah and I know that like from us we're always just doing our best to cater to a customer so like if we make a certain top for a pair of pants and we're getting consistent feedback about the rise or you know maybe they needed more room across the bus do you know whatever it might be we're taking that into consideration in our fittings so we're really just doing our best to fit a garment that will please the most amount of people that are trying a lot yeah I got going to go easy on I mean we read this customer reviews daily yeah yes because I think a lot a lot of people are really helpful. Go on and say I'm this hate this way this is my cup size and this fit me and you know and I I think that's helpful I always tells me weather decides he's down yeah read reviews but also if you buy something really that you really like right and I serve you because you're more likely to give negative feedback then positive and isn't people take reviews like I said really seriously so like if you ever buy something for Moline you really like Take 5 minutes and don't be like I really like that we really appreciate you would appreciate that and other people would appreciate that cuz he might not buy it cuz they'll be like three negative reviews but it could have been something great for them Amy asked what's the biggest misconception of working in the industry probably just said it's all Glamour and you notice a lot of swarthy noticed that when we travel internationally for inspiration when we're building Concepts and episode of collecting ideas early on in the season I think a lot of people think that that just sounds you know just so easy and So Glamorous but it's so much work it's so much work and you know these trips are great I love them but there's just a lot of work and heavy lifting that goes into it so I feel like that's the one misconception that I think a lot of people have that just threw a walk in the park or something I don't know yeah I think that there is a misconception I think it's a lot of people I think it's changed a little bit with people kind of Shining Light on the fashion industry and what goes on behind-the-scenes it's it is a really tough job I mean it's great I love it you obviously love it I love it yeah get your I think that you're probably right there not glamorous people Allison asks do old rules like no white after Labor Day excetera still apply in fashion today I mean to keep that in mind I don't I don't think so we do white year-round now I do yeah maybe white denim we have limited yeah I mean like we're not delivering that typically in December we usually it's true that's true but I think I said Trend rule you can wear white all year round do you think there are any rules that apply I mean I feel like fashion nowadays it's so like there's not as many boundaries around what you can and cannot do and everyone is so expressive with how they want to pull their outfits together and so I don't really think I don't think a lot of those old rules as their least still apply today do you I don't think so but I wear white to a wedding but I think is Attica Trolls but yeah I think that we're also living in a moment but if action is all over the place right I mean there's there's definitely trends that we're looking at that people are following as far as color and silhouette but they're really I can't run the last time I saw someone and I was just like that's why I called because like yeah anything goes now which is great it's really exciting it's inspiring it really allows people to be individuals and dress the way they like I think that for a while people were so married to two Trends in the idea of like these that runs this season not all Trends suit everybody like there are things I tried to pull off or I look back at him like that was not for you skip that one with the worst Trends this no one will know that you've ever ever worn yes on their head as a headband remember that oh yeah yeah any anything you can wear as a headband I wore I guess cuz like the head scarves and reloaded that I'm also remember wearing a beanie all the time for a little while the beanies where I got that was like getting somewhere like that summer BFF like loose ones you're a pretty stylish person and you tend to take lots of rest so I'm I feel like you probably always pulled it off not sure what time yet to see you fail my favorite part of the job I really love the process I love getting to the job but I would say the most rewarding part to me is when I see someone and one of our pieces and you can tell it makes me feel really good that's really cool to be able to like I know that feeling of like putting on something and being like I feel very beautiful in this and like that is the coolest part of the job to me no I mean that that's a that's a really great part of the process I think so for me I mean it would be when we do all of this work and we have our line and we get everything back and we're just looking at it and then when you share it with other people and you see their reaction and the reaction is if the reaction is really positive that just is the such a great part of the process cuz you can see oh wait yes we did it and it's looks great and you know and then seeing it on the streets and seeing it in the wild in the wild and seeing a customer wearing on the work that we've done is just distance brings me so much joy it's so awesome to see yeah it's cool that I mean and also because of social media were able to see that so much more like?
