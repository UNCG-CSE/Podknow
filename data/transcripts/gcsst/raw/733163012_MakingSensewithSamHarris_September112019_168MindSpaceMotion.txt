But before we jump into that the book itself can you summarize what your intellectual history looks like what have you focused on and and who have you been back to Childhood let me start with graduate school in Psychology there was a long story before then but when I entered cognitive psychology and it was an exciting time everything was open brilliant people were around me the language was King and I in many ways it still is and that came from many sources it came from propositional sing King in philosophy it came from Chomsky and language and both of those areas were very much on everybody's mind exciting us it came from our own intuitions that somehow when were thinking were talking to ourselves and even that so that seemed wrong to me there's so much thinking that isn't that and how do those thoughts, and how does it works, they just pop in our mouths and their where it came from psychology where people were showing that the length of a verbal description predicted your memory for The Busy World so all that struck me is incomplete we have a huge memory for faces most of us we can remember faces that we haven't seen in years we could begin to describe them same with scenes and if you sync phylogenetically and brain-wise space in one way or another and its multi-modal occupies half the cortex it it was around evolutionarily long before language came so it struck me that it first of all I must have its own logic that's different from language and that if anything space served the foundation for language and thinking not vice-versa so if it's that government more or less what I was doing at first it was intuitive later I realized it was pretty systematic and that help me carve to to research but it's been many ways spatial thinking was Marjory wise because of that Gemma native language of people thought it was maybe like music or like smells some specialized interest but not Central what seems to have changed that and now everybody's jumping in to space was the Nobel Prize in 2012 to okay from the Mosers for play cells and grid cells which seem to capture our special thing and then very recent research has shown that those same cells in the hippocampus don't just gather information from all over the back or text to code a place but they also Cody Benson time and they and people again gathering multimodal information from the cortex and set those play cells are map in a two-dimensional array on the grid cells so the grid cells and rats map space but in human beings they seem to map conceptual relations Temple relation social relations that helps me argue that spatial thinking is the foundation of faith not a whole lot but the foundation but that's taking a long time at first glance I think we can easily argue about the Primacy of space and movement through space because it's just an evolutionary terms if you can move if you can't send the environment around you and respond it with any action in that space there's no basis to evolve intelligence or anyting else intelligence only matters because you can do something with it that affects your survival the sense of space in the world and a capacity to move within it had to have come online very very early and you know as we know Lily how long before language does the point you made about describing faces is fairly revelatory about the Weatherguard today the importance of of language compared to a memory for 4 in this case the visual object of a face which we knows is represented uniquely in the brain you imagine trying to describe a person's face so that others could recognize it on the base of your linguistic description apart from unit describing someone who has a huge scar or you know who's missing an eye or something and it's just it's completely hopeless task and yet as you say we instantly recognize faces out of among the thousands or tens of thousands we we might recognize instantly so Adams going to kind of just feeding you more areas where we might go hear the other thing that occurs to me is that our sense of Space is really the foundation of ontology our sense of what is real or what exists when you think of the existence of something you're really thinking of a of UniFi default things in space and then they're there are abstract ideas or abstract quantities that people who don't forget me to philosophers have wanted to argue for Millennia now it had to have some existence but because it's not obvious where they exist that has always been someone inscrutable so when you when you think of the things like numbers right. Does the number 7 exist in what sense is the number 7 invention and what sense is it a prior reality will the impediment their eyes were thinking about this seems to be the question of where are the numbers you know without people wear with the numbers be and if so I would I would I would add that that our sense of what is real and what what can be real is also anchored to this this prior sense of space thank you you don't over a lot of what I tried to do in the book and number is fascinating because animals many animals many species everyday there's something new there another new animal that can count or not really count but estimate quite accurately so and animals without speech without any complicated language like ours can solve all kinds of fascinating problems that are very difficult to so babies can do that and all of that seems to be without language so there are other ways of thinking that aren't language and number seems to be tied very much as you suggested to space those of us who have number words and not every language has a number words tend to line up numbers on a line the spa missing between numbers affects how we collect terms in algebra if you look at the notation system that we now use and there were many notation systems that preceded it that weren't a successful the notation system depends on Space the most right-hand column or the are the ones that and to the left of that are the 10 listen to the left of that or the hundreds and so forth and that's special way of erasing numbers becomes essential to toward thinking and we do it without even realizing it's one of the reasons why the Roman numeral screwed everybody up there are many things you can't do well with Roman numerals they sent a complicated way that didn't work right exactly so running spaces underlying how we erase things in the mind and how we then araiza in the world are natural state of awareness of ourselves in the world presents the body of a kind of object in the world for us the most people feel that their their interior to the body in some ways the subject and that they're their body is out there among the other bodies you know what are invulnerable to the the in positions of the environment how do you think about our sense of embodiment of God I can keep the men organized first I avoided because it's you so differently by different than cars and because it's become a buzzword and I always worry about buzzwords the first celebrated and then vilified sne fat is so I worried about that and I thought if I brought it up in a in a Bookman for the general public art have to go through all that philosophy and what did Andy Clark mean what did David course mean what did Larry book and I didn't want to do that but I do think I've shown many phenomena where the body is involved in thinking certainly is a mirror neuron system that we we internalized facial expressions that we see we internalize actions that we see in our own motor system and often that gets expressed in squiggling in moving the body and one way we also imitate and that is a way of thinking and it's a way of remembering and it's a way of understanding so that's one component of embodiment another that I've looked at another people's looked at his gesture and there were three external lising internal Thoughts by setting up some sort of special motor a special mode of representation of what are the four it is worth thinking about so if you ask someone for directions they'll almost inevitably use their arms and their head to indicate how are you should move an offensive gestures say more than the words do the words are more brutal people can't necessarily Express that information well and words they forget turns and so forth so you want to watch that the gestures and usually we do even implicitly we somehow pick them up without conscious awareness that were looking at them or when we're making them that we makes them so those gestures comes to your thinking they can also serve my own so if you sit on your hands and try to describe a route a complicated route to somebody else you're probably going to have trouble doing it and we thought that phenomenon into the laboratory we had and I wish I could show you the videos cuz they're quite fascinating we ask people if we put people alone on a room there were reading complicated descriptions of space locating eight or nine landmarks in an array and either you're walking through it and this is on your right and that's on your left and now turn right and now you see that sort of description or a north south east west description so people had to read these they're hard we were going to test them well they're doing it 70% of our subjects of our participants are staring at the screen and their hands are essentially sketching a map so that's an abstraction has lines lines for passing and points they stamp on the table for places people do it quite differently though the lines and dots are pretty similar we've done the same for explanations of mechanical systems like how a car brake works and it can people are reading their enacting it was their body often and huge gestures sometimes smaller people again do it differently and when we tell people to sit on their hands swell their reading they perform worse on the test so it it's not it's 70% is not everybody but a good portion of people spontaneously gesture so not looking at their hands so somehow that representation that encoding is special motor it isn't Visual and again if they do it there better blind children Jester Camp know that they're just yours are communicating something to you or they're unlikely to a four years old so it it seems to be helping their own thinking and that feels like a mystery to me that those actions of the body that are actually abstractions helping you comprehend and remember and what do you watch these people just touring you get the feeling force of all you season thinking that's exciting but you can't two feelings at the gestures are translating the words into salt times when I speak that gesturing is helping me complete a thought and that if I were prevented from gesturing it would be a kind of impediment so but the words to happy with our use them alive and I rather likes him but if we reach is again expressing actions on thought we raised our ideas with put some fourth we tear them apart these are always we talked about objects so were thinking of ideas as objects and acting on them like often Johnson went through many of these metaphors and tell me and other people before him it would be for them but they're almost is another way of talking about song except his actions on objects role of action and the ways in which we represent it and in the body that can can perform it so much of this is counterintuitive end and unconscious and maybe some of its principal unconscious some of it I think we can become conscious up or we can become conscious of some of the some of the related facts some thinking of things like the the sensory and motor homunculus in the brain damage that the strange proportions with which various parts of the body are represented and and tie to action with a person Suite we have a much but most people have seen this from a psychology textbook is something you talk about in your book as well but you know we have much larger areas of neural real estate devoted to representing that the hands and the lips then the you know the feet you know where the shoulders and so that that the fact that those areas are so much better mapped is is tied to the fact that we would do much more with it with it with our hands and lips and then other parts of her body and we and we we derive much more information we can we can act on the world which with much more precision and yet it's not you looking internally you don't you can't necessarily sense that your your sense of your body is is Warped in that way and then ends and people are surprised you know when you can perform this experiment on yourself and see just how different you are at your two point discrimination is you know if someone puts Tina 2 pencil tips on the palm of your hand you can differentiate that that it's too with the pencil points very close to one another but if you if they do that on your back you know you either they say feels like one point even when there's something like anal I forget an insurer half an inch between pencil points so it's it's not necessarily intuitive and end of ailable for direct inspection and so too with things like maybe mention mirror neurons in the end maze these are these are neurons in the brain that that were discovered by Rosati's group and an actually want one of my advisors at UCLA did work mark yacavoni on this topic and a much has been made of mirror neurons and then perhaps too much has been made of them but they're the regions of the brain and now more than one which respond to the actions of others and it's only a case can be made that we understand the actions of others both there and their intent intentions and goals by mapping them back onto our own bodies you know essentially moving in our imaginations as we as we see other people move and I think I did think of somebody saying your buck are you awake we can notice this in the difference between the way experts will watch certain kinds of of behavior amazing if you're an expert in yoga or ballet or some sport your brain will show a different response to the movements of another expert performing those disciplines than a naive brain will because you know what it's like to open that way and and I think many of us to appreciate this internally from watching sports where is different watching a sport that you spend a lot of time playing yourself cuz if you really you who you know it from the inside and and and it's just amazing to see the best people in the world perform that sport because you can sort of emulate what they're doing in your imagination but then they take seed what you what you've ever done so I guess I just Deluge you with a lot of of your own information but I guess you and I want to hear whatever you have to say about what's available to Consciousness here for a sin in hell we represent the body in the in the bodies of others in and our actions and the actions of others wanted to say and things that I've learned since then and frustrate me cuz I want to add them so going back to the today I'm okay this map which is because hereditary suicide and we did find that recognizing other parts of other bodies is often more tied to their normal size then it is to their actual size so and those were studies done long ago if you look at children's drawings all over the world they tend to be these tadpole drawing cylinder heads Big Heads and arm sticking out and legs sticking out and the rest of those and feet and hands often lots of fingers and things again seems to be how children think of the body even though what they're saying is very different so I think some of that is coming out nicely that the child is drawing what they think and they think of their body is really big moving parts and functional parts and and not so much the actual sizes and I get frustrated when parents want drawings to be or teachers to be more realistic and there's something to learn from drawing realistic things but I also appreciate the expressiveness of drawing what you think and certainly modern artists full of that and charming and frightening and when those kinds of abstractions that that are always fascinating so that's parties one research project that I admire and this is what I did to the mirror system is work of Magnesia for on her colleagues and she brought so there are these Point light demonstration to take somebody in a lab dress them all and black put lights at their joints and ask them to jump play ping pong dance to all sorts of different things when observers see those lighter a statically they make no sense at all you hardly even know it's about it but when they move as they naturally move you can see it's a man it's a woman you can see if somebody's happy you can see if somebody's having you can pick all that up from these lights and there were fewer than 10 of them scattered at the joints you pick up all that information and you pick it up quickly again and it helps small women like me walking dark streets at night to pick up somebody else's movement quickly so I know if I'm in endangering some play or not it's so those those skills we need quite quickly what she did was bringing Paris of people friends and have them do these different videos and bring them back three months later and watch those videos and they were watching videos of themselves of their friend and if a stranger who was part of another couple and their task was to identify what the people were doing playing ping pong are dancing and that they did pretty well but they were also asked who is it and naturally not surprisingly they were better at identifying their friends then perfect strangers I think we're best at identifying themselves that's actually kind of counterintuitive because you you spend less time actually seeing your own certainly your gross body movements mean you don't actually see your leg movements very much for your body moving through space so that's that's kind of surprising it's surprising and it is so what's the theory and there is in the bed with a reason then mirror that you watch that movement you implicitly method on to your own body and the way your body moves and it feels right it's like trying on a piece of clothing and it fits and here it's trying on a pattern of motion and it fits it feels like me so that that is I think counterintuitive as you say and in quite surprising and relates certainly to the work that was done later on recognizing motor activation when you're watching something that you're expert in the classic experiment was comparing caprea dancers with ballet dancers and for both observers both kinds of observers watching either kind of dance did the Rosa motor cortex but the dance who knew aroused more and that could send to your observations about Athletics and hear it again it's a split-second inferencing that we're doing nonverbal there's no way in a fast-moving basketball game that you can figure out what your team is doing what's the other team is doing what they're going to do who's faking me how do I fake when's the levels of complexity that are required for those sports are extraordinary and against split-second of course they depend on the expertise and practice and so forth but none of that is it's much too fast forwards it's it just couldn't happen otherwise so the Athletics so one more thing on the inferencing this is work of a of a talented group in Genoa and Italy and I were with them a little bit but they did the major part of the work they can show videos of an arm reaching for a bottle and they trunk has the video before your hand even touched the bottle but you can tell from watching those truncated videos whether the person about to Grass the bottle is going to drink from it it's going to pour was going to give it to you and even know that before the hand gets there was so those intentions about their bodies even normal people are reading very quickly it turns out in this again I learned later that children on the Spectrum have a harder time with it and they also have a harder time making the movements as you know mirror neurons have been implicated in in autism spectrum and I know exactly that way and to think that it's a motor function deficit that underlies this very deep and disorder that seems to have huge implications for people's lives is fascinating and again coming back to motor it turns out that for people who are aging and I belong in that category moving is is a moving in space is more essential to preserving cognitive functions and doing crossword puzzles motion again is is not just important for our immediate survival but for our cognitive facilities and certainly for emotional and and social and just about every aspect of Our Lives that I hadn't heard of related to this gesture set of you you just described with with videos of reaching Behavior there was a video study of basketball players shooting free throws where they they would stop the video in a before the the ball reaches the basket and eat at various distances from the basket and it showed that basketball players were better than coaches and fan and the News sports journalist at predicting which free throws would make it into the basket so you have become an expert audience but still that the basketball players themselves were better at making these predictions based on that the visual cues is probably being math than one way or another on their own body and they've had enough practice people talk about basketball players as being free throw machines that they consent whether it's going to make it or not I'm in that study I don't think has been done but it would be nice to do about sense of direction I'm always I bet I think we're out we're all that we've all been enrolled in a vast psychological experiment where we systematically degrade our sense of direction and also our sense of map Reading because we're now totally dependent on GPS but some people are famous we have great sense of direction and some people have terrible ones I can attest that my wife Annika has a sense of direction that's so bad it's truly perverse I mean it's actually would it was fascinating to me about her sense of direction is that it's reliably wrong it's not just randomly wrong it's just it actually contains information she she wants to go more often than not in the wrong direction that is used to the other diametrically opposite direction we're supposed to be going in and it's almost like she she knows what the right direction is and then has to has to flip it somehow to go to and go in the wrong direction do you I don't remember if you touch sensitive in the book but we're in directly at it right and there's a egg and there's a long answer they are and it's complicated you can remember Roots as as procedures you go down the street turn right turn left you can have a more global map of the environment here in but you still have to place yourself in it so you have this overview perspective and then you have this immediate surroundings perspective or you're placing yourself in it and that's a trick that's hard and the harder for some people than for ulcers Russ Epstein at the pain has done beautiful work on on the Myriad components that it takes to navigate space and understand space so there are levels of understanding space and I have a suspicion that what your wife is doing is something that one of my kids and I sometimes do events if you interrupt if you go in a straight or enter a store by turning left when you get out you turn left again so then you're in the opposite direction is as opposed to reversing the direction and turning right so it's a kind of heuristic that that is 90% or 180 off and that might be what what Anika's problem is I have no idea my father was helpless he kept getting us lost in and so it turns out that the ability to keep track of yourself in space is independent of other special abilities and that's fascinating to the special abilities are a complex of things and people trying to make sense of them and interrelated me some of it three-dimensional some of the two-dimensional is some of it and majnun yourself moving imagining an object moving sensible ways of trying to make sense of the abilities but they don't seem to make sense of the abilities and navigation seems to be independent of these other special abilities I want to also am going back to some of the threads that your question raised the overview and the road View and perspective taking because that score in many ways Court to our lives taking out their perspectives and taking other perspectives on the ground when I'm facing you and I have to explain something to you and do I take your perspective on mine when I'm interpreting your behavior am I taking your perspective or mine and then going above and getting a map of a territory so we can think of those overview maps not just of a spatial array of places but also of ideas we said the grid cells map conceptual relation or social relations and or political relations and people can map their social networks right these are networks there points for people or ideas and the lines between them or the relations between the people or between the ideas and that's again like space we navigate from place to place along paths ideas because that that's fascinating is it in your book you discuss how categories can be presented to us as natural or again kind of perverse act passage here that I think I'll read it just reminded me why I Loved Before has the South American writer so what we were talking about the eight categories and that is the passage from Bora house that you use proper as an example of how not to not to do this the following is a taxonomy of the animal kingdom it has been attributed to an ancient Chinese encyclopedia entitled Celestial Emporium of benevolent knowledge on those remote Pages it is written than animals are divided into a those that belong to the emperor embalmed ones see those that are trained Dee suckling pigs e e mermaids F fabulous ones G stray dogs H those are included in this classification those a tremble as if they were mad J innumerable ones K those that are drawn with a very fine camel's hair brush and that resemble flies from a distance and so what's funny about that is that it plays Upon Our or intuition which is your way up we started Caracas naturally that it would be completely useless to organize things that way and it because one that did that list of different types of animals is infinite that mean you could expand it indefinitely and we started get that into ends and your point is that we have a natural way of categorizing things and you breaking into the exhibit at the basic level the superordinate level in the subordinate level instead of the basic level would be a dog that a superordinate level would be an animal you know all dogs are animals and the subordinate level level would be a cocker spaniel say so a specific type of dog and you make a point that we all learn the basic level first anyone who has kids you know knows this that your dogs are discriminated long before the the general class of animals or these specific class of cocker spaniels perhaps draw the connection there to spatial thinking and then the rest of what you've been talking about a quote from Eleanor rosch did the basic work on basic level category a beautiful research project and Shifting The Narrative the way we talked about scores from artificial ones like large red squares and small green triangles two categories that are meaningful in the world and so her researches beautiful in it was the basics of Warren and sub Lorton is her work the contribution we made was showing that the basic level seems to be privileged partly because the parts are organized in a way and that the parts connect people's perception with function so we can look at a banana in the peel is for taking off and we eat the inside or a chair we could see that it has a seating arms and a back and we we connect those with a function and this happens in particular at the basic level so that was our contribution but the major contribution is is hers and her research group what's we need to categorize you think of a baby and a baby is is having a hard time or takes a lot of learning before the baby can distinguish objects from the background the world of the baby is just a bunch of pixels that keep changing and doesn't yet have meaning so figuring out which things are objects or figures and what's background is is a huge feet of the mind and or the brain and the Brain eventually ends up with places that are the tools of computations that let you see that this is a fruit or a vegetable or a piece of furniture this is a scene this is the body and there are places in the brain more than one usually dedicated to doing the computations that are required to recognize those objects so that's a huge amount of work for the brain and babe these are doing a very quickly and very orally in the first months of life so they'll recognize when a spoon is coming at them or a bottle is coming out there and cry and they were taken to the bedroom cuz they be taking a category important think of me walking dark streets at night I need to quickly recognize friends and Pho and what's moving what is it and so forth in order to plan my own behavior if I had to recompute that every time I wouldn't be able to act or move so those for me cuz I was basic categories and of action of objects of people is crucial to our existence it can get us into trouble when we miss categorize cuz we can't help but doing it do you know the classic example is mistaking a toy gun for a real gun and being defensive in a way that is tragic but so categories have bet the advantages and disadvantages and like almost anything or think it's hard for people and hard for scientists to think about trade-offs they're always looking for maximizing someone best thing and it's it's everything has advantages and disadvantages every cognitive and it's easier for us to thinking categories which are conglomeration of features than to think of continue Bradshaw gradations and were not very good at thinking of the intricacies of continua on an almost any any Dimension going from probability this is something that still tedlock on his group keep them for something that people think of things in terms of likely unlikely or unsure and don't think of the whole rain and it is time for us to deal with a whole range it's much easier cognitively to just say these are good people these are bad people yeah yeah I would at that time I was thinking that when you used to talk about by the rigidity of these categories are the real kind of binary nature of it some of the most consequential limitations of this thinking appears in in this space of of the social domain admin to think of good people versus bad people or racist vs non racist or Flyers vs truth-tellers it's so inflexible to the complexities of of what we're actually confronted with in in terms of the the continued of human behavior and character you talk about these 9 laws of cognition and I thought we could just run through them and that you really just show you for you hit upon the first law already the first law of cognition is there are no benefits without costs so maybe perhaps you we can just I'll just run through them in and you can give us whatever color you want want to give us there or so on this first one one trade off and it comes to mind for me is the the trade-off between type 1 and type 2 errors right if you're if you're going to have any Machinery or act of cognition or Human Institution that is going to be better and better tuned to find certain things in the world certain problems is he trying to dial right or left you're going to let you have this trade-off between false-positive and false-negative I don't know if there any exceptions to this rule but this seems to be generally the case if you turn your detector up in a too high I'll get a lot of false positive you turn it to low you will get fewer but then you'll fail to detect things you want to detect what else do you think of in terms of there being no benefits without cost yeah I know that would certainly be one of them and they are you you try to evaluate the costs of making those two types of errors and people sometimes in places they do but it or even explicitly when they're making marketing decisions are business decisions or choices in life what would I regret if I did this and we don't always think through all those consequences and I think that's a real problem everywhere of is how to think through the temple consequences of of any action that we might take cuz it gets more and more uncertain as weak as we go up further into time there's also a spatial Continuum that we often don't think about in here is kind of perspective-taking is we want to know what landscape is again going back to the side A of a method how can we fill in that map and how can we do make other prospective so perhaps even thinking of that is one of the special aspects of a decision and what of the temporal ones the consequences and what station would be the other possibilities is that small reminder could be a corrective when were planning and if we have the time to plan so back that could be a corrective the trade of Summer everywhere it's in evolution we're not maximizing were and we're not we don't want to completely fitted mesh because then delish will change and we have to adapt to another Manish so that's creating variability Evolution does that and learning that learning is another I think another one of those trade-offs and in some ways they praise off with creativity so that there are cases where I want to learn an ADB Association that whenever I'm speaking French whenever I think of chair isolation and that getting that Association tight will will let me speak French more fluently and it'll help me learn historical facts and scientific facts and we all is school children spend a lot of time of memorize things those associations for my ADP so we could know history and no science and perform well on the test but when were trying to be creative it's exactly that was highly learned Association that we have to break so they can in some ways being creative is is a bit the antithesis of learning so again we have a trade-off and somehow we want to be able to do both and we can develop tricks or heuristics for Learning and keeping that learning intact and and systematic and Malaya and we can also learn tricks for expanding almond when we need to be Innovative and creative and maybe taking this special view in the temporal field is our ways of doing that on the other side of learning in which is that you know we we come into this world not knowing a whole hell of a lot I mean is there other species that know much more than we do and then so we don't we don't have much that's hard-coded and that's because it seems that we've evolved this truly broad capacity to learn so that we can we can flexibly adapt to our niche in our in our in our social situation so we come into this world just unable to walk where I was you know a gazelle is born especially born running the fact that we have this level of flexibility in certain circumstances makes us vulnerable and as you point out creativity is breaking the pattern on the other side of learning so I get to the second law of cognition action molds perception what do we mean by that it is very science-oriented friend said to me yesterday what do you mean by law and I said you were thinking of chemistry and physics right and of course she was these cognitive loss or lost in that way and they aren't lost in the sense of of law of the legal profession that it's something terrible will happen to you or you refined or put in jail if you break them they're meant to be ways of capturing generalities that is that are not always true but very much capturing them so immense that by law and action molds perception again has been shown over and over again that are learning our perceptual learning depends on acting in the world so classic experiment was done of the two centuries ago now by Stratton putting Prismatic glasses on people that up turn the world upside down or shift is it by 60° and eventually you would but the only way you would that this by moving in the world and by reaching for things and moving your body in the world and then you adapt and within a certain amount of time the days or weeks you know number of perceiving the world upside down without glasses but you're perceiving it is normal so your perception has adapted to the action but without the app your perception wouldn't have adapted to that experiment and I think he wore the glasses for a month if I'm not mistaken and that was that seemed pretty painful right right it's sort of amazing how how and when the brain adapts it pass, the only did experiments on students at Harvard they were volunteers and they volunteer probably for a high sum of money to wear blindfolds and essentially turn them into blind people and what happened to them quite quickly in a matter of days in weeks was what happens to blind people and that's the occipital bone which is usually used for vision was taken over by touch yeah which is fascinating that kind of plasticity than some of the same computations that are done for the visual world are done for the tekto world and that our sense of touch can partially replace our sense of vision of David Eagleman who's trying to utilize the same property the brain but without without limited Vision he's just creating devices like I like a vest people wear that takes in visual information or you may have a an acoustic one as well but he's definitely done it with vision where did uses touch receptors or touch effectors in the vest to cut a map visual data in addition to what people are saying with their eyes as a way of him growing up a new sensor and augmented sense of the environment based on haptics you know it's fascinating and a lot of work is done to help blind people so he was at the Apparently using the tum using a camera mapping space on to the time is is one of the more effective ways than the best in the back is unused real estate but is he pointed out the back isn't that discrimination on the back of some very good so yes people are being very creative and in Prime 2 math different sensory systems on each other to either enhance or replace right now it's exciting exciting uses of Technology a lot of trial-and-error and it's also a way of experiencing our computer Okay the third law cognition feeling comes first so this again his work of that is most associated with Bob designs and he showed people nonsense figures sort of 10 grams in flappy things made out of our appointed things made out of that work just black filled in and he had people remember them and also react how much did they like some and he found that the liking really came first the people the more you saw the same figure these are not particularly beautiful figures is it more you saw a particular figure the more you liked it and you're liking came before you recognized it so you knew you liked it before you knew that that you'd seen it before so it's our emotional reactions could come very quickly and think of all kinds of evolutionary reasons why that might come quickly and the cognition the awareness of having seen it before and the recognition explicit recognition that you've seen it before it comes later know if you didn't try an implicit recognition task now that might have shown that are implicit recognition comes just as fast as the emotion but showing that separation was interesting and later work has shown that some of the emotional pathways are different from the pathways that establish more stable visual representations so it's in many ways behavioral research comes before it's not just the feelings come before recognition Behavior research is establishing the phenomena that later brain research can back up but it's the phenomenon was demonstrated behaviorally Sebastian apply in Spades two faces and bring us back to the first law of when faces might arouse for Motorola's Beauty and any kind of emotional responses those things are going to die together before the mind can override perception of other people's work and then and it is an old one by Foreigner and powder and they showed out of focus photographs of things in the world they were unusual angles of things in the world and one group was shown in the photograph immoralist info in focus and as to say what they were in the other group was shown them first out of focus gradually brought into focus and people were asked to guess all alone the guessing interfered with a scene so that by the time the object was in full Focus they couldn't see what it was formed a theory in advance as I guess I would you like that to confirmation bias and in some way or confirmation bias it could be linked to the way we interpret other people's behavior I mean David rosenhan's famous and maybe Infamous study done in the in a psychiatric hospital where people say an episode got themselves admitted to the hospital and later tried to get themselves out as manifestations of whatever diagnosis they've been given in the first place so it is that is an example of confirmation bias that were looking for supper even though it sometimes makes sense even existed but that was hilarious and and also depressing punchline of those studies but I think I remember that they they warned the hospital that they would be doing this or perhaps it was a second study done after another are there complaints about the the results of the first study that you know they would they essentially ambushed these hospitals that I believe they actually worn them in advance and it's still work Mehmet my memory could be someone confounded here but you know my memories of that either en espanol since I read it but I think in order to ensure that these graduate students would eventually be released cuz the different time somebody in the hospital knew that it was happening I don't think the diagnosing psychiatrist news at I'm where the diagnosing psychiatrist said this could never happen to us because we never work in our hospital and they in the researcher said okay just get ready and then and it and they still were unable to detect some of the people who were sham sham patients but I'll have to look back and see I wouldn't be surprised again confirmation bias is something it's been one of those things that has benefits and cost when were trying to understand somebody's behavior and 1/2 hypothesis we need to look for a little bit of confirmation to confirm what we're looking at now that can get over you cuz we could be wrong and we have to be open to that but figuring out if somebody is about to attack us over or not we need to look for more than one piece of evidence that our hypothesis is true and then if were super rational will rejected when we find inconsistent information always do that we tend to dismiss and that's been shown over and over again in social psychology that we tend to dismiss disconfirming information explain it away and to keep the information that that's it's our hypothesis cognition mirrors perception this again is many people have gone through that I think one of the nicest examples has work said my husband is an account him and died years ago and I think it's it's what it is really got them excited together I must have been working on certain errors and decision-making data had been working on certain phenomenon perception that they both saw that your current state was distorting everything that your car and stayed in perception your level of adaptation was influencing how you responded to other stimuli in in a perceptual world and your current state in an economically world was against the way you were looking at at games and losses so the fact that the same phenomenon of your current state exaggerated those changes that are immediately around it and your current step count change that was true in perception it was true in cognition so that is the one I think nice example another is the sort of hypothesis the downsides of hypothesizing in the experiments that coming up with I pappas's distorts your perception and and makes you blind to two Services information in the perceptual world and we know that that happens in the social world in the political with in the scientific World War Lowe's to give up our own theories and see things as fitting into them so those same cognitive abstract hypothesis can be explained show up in perceptual in in our own work on an understanding how people understand space so turns out that people think that cities within a state or closer to each other with Insidious between so we group them in that way and that same phenomenon happens with social group so we think that that Democrats are more alike to each other then and Republicans are more alike to each other then a particular Democrat and a particular Republican and it's again a matter of categorisation and and within category distinctions are ignored and between category distinctions are in large is something that happens in perception is something that happens in every form of cognitions socio-political theoretical scientific it's there all over run the sixth floor spatial thinking is the foundation of abstract thought we might have touched on this a bit already. I think we did just both that brain Foundation to language that were using were talking about ideas as if they were objects in space where our minds go from idea to idea the way we move from place to place so I think that's again another phenomenon that seems to show up in many in many forms the 7th Ward cognition the mind fills in missing information for example of objects include other objects and we feel that in we connect the dots we see I'm looking out a cut behind a Kleenex box a whole cup isn't there but I can imagine if there is Scott McCloud someone whose work I love understanding comics and it's a book I recommend to anybody who wants to understand the way we make stories out of the world and visual as well as for full stories how they work together and and complementary supplementary and he talks about when you show images in comics you might show somebody sitting behind a desk you know they have legs typically so you're going to feel that in my colleague is Stanford a shown over and over again in language that we're constantly making inferences and feeling in our information is incomplete and again if we didn't do that would be flummoxed by the world if we didn't constantly feeling information that's not there play play 1 thot overflows the mind the Mind puts it in the world is not distinctly human it's there seems to be a break we're missing those links between the gray Davidson and us we're gradually filling them in with with skulls and bones but we painted for cognitive or esthetic or social behavior from those things and it's a mystery it will probably always be a mystery maybe not every night around when it's all but we puts out in the world we've done it since Antiquity you can find Tali Bones from 70,000 years ago or Telly's roxor on Bones so there seems to be a need to put toner in the world we do it and words as I'm doing now with the word and gesture if we do it in what's that we put on the faces of cave walls or stones and what's interesting looking back at those things I've always fascinated me the Antiquities I had for those in any Museum and I dragged my kids to Antiquities all over the world instead of resorts it is what did what ideas are people putting into the world and one of them is space maps go way back in many forms time goes way back or some time is indicated by events and times so cave walls will have hands on them and petroglyphs on them so space and time calendars don't go that go back so it's another some more abstract way of representing time people objects bows and arrows animals so the things that are important to us and have dedicated real estate in the brain are other things that we represent and then rudimentary number not number the way we think of it one two three four Batali's and Telly's again seem to be found all over the world in many places and it's usually a one-to-one correspondence which all cultures seem seem to have even if they can't count they don't have number words that can have to write and Telly's we use today you go to a restaurant to get a reservation to see if they're there was a table the person that made her day we'll look at the map of tables and see which ones are unmarked that's the kind of tally and give you that table so we're using that kind of thinking 121 Tally's and representing at in the world so those are ancient representations and we certainly do a great day for that today with diagrams and maps and charts and sketches and and visual narratives and all of those have communicate ideas often more directly then and then the words to okay the ninth and final law of cognition we organize we organised stuff in the world the way we organize stuff in the mind and so much of the world now is designed and it's if you started out with categories in the mind so we have vegetables and fruit and within that apples and bananas and carrots and we have musical instruments in and we have clothing and furniture and so forth while the world we do the same thing in the world those categories are on my mind that we have furniture stores and grocery stores in within grocery stores foods are categorized in some kind of world we have one to one correspondences in our minds and we put them out in table setting this and we put them out and buildings every apartment has Windows and a balcony and doors and so forth Wanderers correspondences what's an apartment so we have orders we order our children by the order in which they were born we order our students Spivey when they finished wait wait for my orders what we like we ordered so orders when kids are doing that what's your favorite color your favorite food so we're ordering things all the time and run orders in our minds we put them in who's on top who's the best we put that on our bookshelves we order them so all of these ways of seems that's another another biggie that's comfortable anyways two categories that all the things we need to prepare a male they're going to be in the kitchen the things we need to keep clean or going to be in the bathroom and so forth so we've organized different kinds of things by the way way use them and again that goes out into the World movie theaters versus versus dance halls versus schools there seems that are organized around the things that are done all the things that we need to get those things done train station so it would be willing nomadic ancestors didn't have that they had minimal organization so the world had our children are experiencing that we're experiencing as so much information and so many abstractions like one to one correspondences and repetitions and cemeteries and categories there's so much out there in the world is giving us so much abstract information cuz we put our mind into the world so I go one step further than that it didn't get into it design the world with diagram so if you look at the street systems they tell us where buses can go where bikes can go where people can go when to go when does stop how to turn if you can turn so if you look at it it's all out there telling us how we can move guiding our movement but also enabling her movement so it's really no movement with essentially diagram the world see my desktop Barber you would know that they have a knife law of cognition breakdown catastrophically in certain cases with window messy desks lead to more ideas for parents here is is is there anything that is actionable I make it I think like much of what we care about spatial thinking is trainable in some sense and Ebenezer is just at one point I was so surprised and gratified to see that you are at your big fan of comics and you think that it they convey information in a way that is distinct enough from books that to the fact that there are considered a a lower art form is not especially productive when it comes time to to get children to appreciate storytelling temporal and spatial relationships seem like a big fan of comics so what else should parents know about this we all wait for babies to talk and get all excited and then when they're talkin everything sounds like but it could be banana but they could be bus but it isn't a deep dive into their mind but you couldn't really see what they're thinking by watching them by looking at their eyes if their heads what's attracting their attention there is more that you can see so I think there's a lot we can learn about how to look at babies and how to understand their minds before they talk sure we can also enhance their cognition and then special thinking I'm glad you brought that up as one of them it turns out that spatial thinking is important for stem and now look for stem education science technology engineering and Medicine our world is becoming more technological understanding those things is more and more important schools typically don't teach them they teach Reading Writing arithmetic but they don't teach understanding the world is represented on the page on the screen and exact can be fun giving kids naps and asking them to plot the route as I used to do when when I was taking my kids places I said one of you can sit in the front with the map and give me road construction but you can't fall asleep and of course they always did so they doing fun things like that having kids construct them I having kids and it make diagrams there's no movement in fact in art to have kids represent information in one way or another not all houses in flowers and in cars and horses and the sorts of things kids are prone to drawing so in other think that's useful for finding other ways to express ideas that can be abstractions and can communicate and express and Reach people in many different ways so am I'm all for that language helps hear there was some studies done by colleagues at the University of Chicago but other places showing that if you call attention to spatial relations two small children this has 2 3/4 you can do it called attention to parallel special parallel to sizes the movement all of that calling attention and language helps Advance the kids understanding helps them attend is possible that it will help them to understand mathematical relation and other abstractions so yeah and I'm going to call Mike that you know I'm not a universal fan of, very dark, except I walked into a comic book store and my youngest daughter was getting into Batman and some of the associated characters and I naively just grabbed a bunch of comics in that section you know related to those characters and brought them home and they were they were so inappropriate for a child of you know really any age that it will go down in the annals of bad parenting that fact that I just handed these Comics over what happened with my older daughter who discovered that I had invited her younger sister into the darkest dungeon of the adult imagination but if I could lyrics, fiction or nonfiction there's good stuff in bed stuff and stuff that will capture some kids in France was Mele who's the cover a figure of the New Yorker and used to be an underground Comics editor has developed a set of readers that are comics for children from one up their excellent they're called tune books and the content is appropriate that she brings in fine, coo, cowardice and storytellers to do the the drawings and the drawing sound illustrations the story is really told in the visuals of the combination of the visuals and the words and so those are safe I think and I've sent them to my own granddaughters grandson and they love them sometimes they're a little subversive mischievous but but I'm the holes are they were safe there more and more good graphic novels for girls boys that again the content is perfectly appropriate I think what it does it was some of them do and why I'm a bit of a fan is they draw attention to the visual World they help kids learn to scrutinize the visuals and understand them to understand how pot Pastor expresses emotion and expresses action and her facial expressions through that help people are interacting how close are they how far they those sorts of visual spatial interactions that are happening amongst people there are maps and diagrams and in many Comics Dora has maps and it's so is helping kids understand those abstractions and see them as a normal part of life so that's one reason I'm I'm in favor of comics for kids it doesn't their words there too so the kids have to read and it turns School teachers love them because they know that kids it gets kids into reading and I've seen that too I mean I hate it and it don't sound the plural of anecdote aren't data but is there when you get to older people and kids and adults it turns out that often especially in explaining abstract ideas the diagrams and charts and maps are more effective than descriptions of them so it can Tunes kids into integrating the visual world the abstractions in the visual world the spatial abstractions with language think about ordinary conversation we can see each other now but if we could again the gestures would matter the facial expressions would matter all of that matters and real-life interaction in meetings who gets looked at is the next speaker and people are aware of that and also aware of who they look at is an indication so those subtle forms of social interaction that again are happening in that one can be expressed in comics and kids can pick them up when someone someone's looking away not seeing and someone else is seeing so that the good graphic books capitalize on all of that there was there was so many clever ways that they convey information through metaphors two boxes inside boxes it is just the art form as an art form is 10z not everything but it can be extraordinary will be aware of your time and sideswipes one final question you you mentioned your late husband Amos at one point and you know it while I I really just wanted to talk to you about you and your work in this interview it seems remiss not to ask you at least one question about him just because he had such an outside influence on psychology and I never had the pleasure of meeting him and I'm I'm painfully aware now of the fact that I was at Stanford at a time where I might have met the two of you much earlier in life that was us turn a missed opportunity but what was it about him that was so remarkable because he's one of these scientists who in the stories that have been circulated about him he achieve the kind of mythical status and you get the sense that more or less everyone who came into his orbit professionally felt that they were then functioning very much in his shadow anyway you haven't got the sense frankly to Danny felt that way Danny is many people know Danny conoman who later went on to win the Nobel Prize for work that day he did jointly with with Amos that's why your name is Hattie live would it would have certainly one that same prize what was so unusual about him so much is a brilliant Sparkles the clarity of mind the vision the phone and made everything fun let me just terrific fun the energy was there and the fun was there but the clarity of mind and the vision. Justin psychology and philosophy but I'm politics he'd been active in politics in his room before he came to the states is it basically as a teenager and and the friends and his will would wait for him to come back from the states to give them the clear the political scenes of social scene when we will graduate students I remember walking him and he was many years ahead of me walking home one night very late it was 27 so almost done with his degree which was late because of three years in the Army and one of those dark nice when in the years when you could still see stars and were walking home and he described his vision for his career he said there were two filled their similarity there's judgment and he's going to work on both of them and he had a vision for how he was going to work on both those fields and that's what he did he was right on picking the feels he was right on how they were developed under their centrality for thinking and for the implications philosophy and politics in in policy and whatever and they could not mix and he was right on thinking ahead and if that was there when he was 27 so you have to fall in love with that I was already there throughout life I mean with the decision to go back to Israel the decision to leave his real his political Acumen and prediction he just he just had that quick understanding and vision almost prophetic so we arrived in Israel I'm someone who's never left the United States if I don't know where the people I'm in the middle of graduate school I arrive in Israel and 5 months later was the Six-Day War and I must have been a paratrooper and a officer and he said on May 22nd windows are closed the Straits of tiran they're going to come in and get me and sure enough at 10 at night they came and got it and the City of Jerusalem was in a panic that remember decision so he came home once or twice before the war started and he said not to worry it's all are power and who is right so over and over again he would say something like that that was prophetic just so yeah and then addition that was the fun it's just was well and in some counterfactual world I got to hang out with him but in this one at least I met you and that that was a great pleasure to meet you at that you came to the event that Danny and I did a New York and try to meet you my side to a joy I point out rather often and his interviews that the conversation almost never exhausts what is interesting in the book of that that's doubly true and in the present case we really did it this much more in your book about the psychology of space and action and and it may linkage two more less everything that makes us human cognitively thank you for your time Barber thank you it was a pleasure if you find this podcast valuable there many ways you can support it you can review it on iTunes or Stitcher or whatever happened to listen to it you can share it on social media with your friends you can blog about it or discuss it on your own podcast or you can support it directly and you can do this by subscribing through my website at samharris.org and there you'll find subscriber-only content like my ask me anything episodes as well as the bonus questions from any of these interviews you also get advance tickets to my Live Events you'll find all these things and more at samharris.org and thank you for supporting the show listeners like you make it possible
