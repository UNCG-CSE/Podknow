Limo from gimlet this is reply-all I'm out School Alex Goldman PJ Vogt or back we are did you miss me I feel like I could see the point I actually said I miss you a lot buddy or something oh yeah there was a giveaway week we have a super tech support super tech support is the segment on our show where listeners come to us with tech problems that seem totally intractable and unsolvable and I do my best to solve them so this week we got an email from a gentleman named Halen okay Smile as big fan of any 1-day llen and every time I see my brains like Van Halen for every single time I want a new brain so let me tell you what happened to Halen Halen has what I would call a strange passion which is that ever since he was young he loved air conditioners I was always obsessed cold weather when I was a kid and being in Louisiana on TV didn't get a lot and we always had like a window units so I would just sit in front of the window unit and just let it like blow in my face and just think about like skiing I would pretend I was like skiing or something like something in the cold weather it's so cute so a couple months ago Halen who's now in his early thirties move to Colorado Springs and he's super stoked because he's no longer in like human Louisiana whether he is in like cool Colorado weather okay soheila moves in with some people you do from Louisiana and he takes a room in the basement it's unfinished it all tile and one night not long after he moves in his roommates have all gone asleep and he's just like downstairs by himself in this big echoey totally bear room at nothing down there it was literally just a mattress a blanket and a pillow there's literally nothing down there and then when he's ready to go to sleep he has his and he's looking for like white noise to help him sleep and he finds a sound that says air conditioner and he's like oh the comforting sound of my youth that's perfect that's exactly what I want that's wonderful and he lays down in bed closes his eyes and you know drifting off and then I hear what I believe to be the jingling of keys and a door opening the back door leads directly down the stairs of my room and my first thought was my roommate which they go to sleep at like 9 p.m. so I'm like that's weird that they're up and coming in and I was sure everyone was home for the night and then I hear footsteps like they're coming downstairs this can't be them but I'll just start one on my way who is this did I lock the door cuz I start panicking my heart I mean it again began to palpitate and my hands kind of went numb the footsteps get closer closer and I was real basically just paralyzed it's pitch-black he can't see anything and that's what my best bet was to just basically hide under the covers yeah I didn't think there was any Escape at this point and then he hears a woman say something he can understand it sounds like it's in a foreign language in the footsteps stop all we can hear the air conditioner but then he hears the footsteps again and here's the woman speak again somewhere in the room and he realizes she saying the exact same thing she just said and when he finally picked out from under covers the basement is empty okay over there about what's going on yes those footsteps and I wasn't talkin are on the artificial yeah so he's hearing it Loop yeah okay so he must have felt somewhat embarrassed yeah he was he was pretty embarrassed but he became he was like why would an app that's meant to calm you down have like the serial killer sound of like a woman jingling her keys with a protein footsteps so he wakes up and starts trying to figure out what's going on robley upwards of like 30 to 40 times and just listen to on repeat that sounds like an activity I would do if I was super high oh yeah well it's Colorado she just had moshi moshi yeah so she said hello in Japanese so it sounds like somewhere in Japan a woman is walking down a long hallway while jangly her keys and then she sees having intestinal out it sounds to me like she's like saying hello to the security guard in him at the front desk of a place and being like hello I'm going to my office now in my head it's like she's walking down the hallway of her apartment and it's like when you go to let yourself in until it's already there it's so weird it gives me more feelings I thought it would what kind of feelings does it give you in the world before you met them this is a real PJ thought that we were like at the same bar on the same street or at the same show I'm only ever in my basement so I don't know whether it's not true I just want to get that out there and on the record I don't have never killed anyone your denials noted I don't know you I guess you don't feel so the people in your basement but like just a weird like there's a slightly like weird sweet lonely feelings just like someone out in the world doing something to dry sense of a human being totally I do understand that before you snap their life's out before I watch the light go out of their eyes and up on this White Noise app right so I actually heard the clip left talking to him on the phone but would I want to do is recreate the bug for myself which I thought would be very simple I don't know how to login but it turned out to be a hard hey Google play the sound of an air conditioner I thought it was treating eye in the studio maybe you should tell it what kind of sound do you like in the Google home app hey Google play the sound of an air conditioner Google Play sleep sounds okay no damn it that's not what I'm so I actually gave up on the Google home and I had to install the Google assistant on my phone to get the sound but I did get the sound you gave up on yours like I can't use a Google home I don't think that's the thing that children use but in the process of trying to make the sound play on the Google home I figured out that it actually came from a third-party app that you have to install on Google home that's made by a little company from Melbourne Australia called healing. FM okay and all they traffic in is like meditation and relaxation apps that's all they make theirs they make more than one yeah they make sleep sounds healing sounds storm sounds just anything and everything to help you relax so I reached out to the co-founder if you . FM this guy named Adrian rush and he told me that he got into the relaxation app game because he himself was trying to be a more relaxed person personal I guess journey I can call it quits smoking I quit drinking and I was also looking for ways I could actually relax and meditate myself which is something you know was already used to at the time and looking for a way a way to solve that problem starts pulling together all these sounds for this app that he wants to build really surprised at the level of thought that goes into picking sounds for relaxation. So like what do you want your rain you want your beach with waves and words with sort of like humming sound in it when kissing people really want is you have to mix up a sound like they might have a wave sound and then they might want to rain on top of that some people don't like seagulls on the beach noise he calls in the wife's really crushing the sand sunny I know when I play like a beats that never occurred to me to be like I don't like these waves are crashing too hard to what it what does that mean like do French people need to hear the sounds of French beaches he was like does that mean there has to be like there's like a Frenchman selling like french punch and like French lunch anyway I asked Adrian about the air conditioner so the reason that I'm calling the specific sound that I'm calling about is the air conditioner sound like I have some talk in the background of it I think it was someone was soaking the background to say hello in sinhala language so Adrian make sense we did not mean to put that on the app that actually now and if you went on there right now in my footsteps and I apologize for that 50 sounds and about that that's no longer a snippet Penney's women's life end up on the sleep sounds app which seems like every pretty easy to answer but it was not easy to answer like for starters Adrian told me we didn't make that recording we get our sounds from other companies as I thought this is exactly what you guys did you made recordings for your sleep sounds app there is this other company that has a whole library of sounds and that is where we get our sound from nobody does anything in this world it's crazy but like the whole game is like you try and get the best possible sounds like a market for hey you want to buy an air conditioner sound basically do you know where you guys got that sound we got that from play sound effects Pro sound effects as a company yes what one of the biggest kiss one of the biggest companies that recordes these yes interesting sound effects is a company based in Brooklyn we are rolling we are rolling we are on the corner of 10th Avenue and North 1st in Williamsburg Brooklyn we are about to go to meet Douglas price the owner Pro sound effects. Calm he is going to hopefully shed some light on the mysterious recording of the air conditioner hi to my producer Damiano and I met Douglas in the lobby of his office and he is a very physically imposing guy he's really big but he was super friendly second floor great room should I sit over here that you would also have much more on the business anything but we have a bunch of audio nerds allowing came from NYU Music Tech and I'm the boring business guy show any sound effect for any situation they want to be the ones that can provide it for you and what Douglas told me was like every time you hear a video game sound a lot of times when you're hearing like a notification sound in a nap a lot of sounds from sound effects in movies they will Source them from companies like his right so surprising that I think it is surprising to me before. Did you think that when you like using i m program on your phone that the company hires a wind chime or something and I don't I just figured that they made the sound in house I mean you know that Windows 95 South by Brian Eno hahaha so I'm just like oh my my my understanding Brian Eno just as God's got to figure they're like I want to think about the refreshing sounds from like a sound you get your refresher like Facebook feed it's like this really cool like what I assumed that I cry during a obtuse okay so it's shocking this is shocking news so they have betrayed now. I guess that I'd never really thought about where, where it comes from fear that everything the world is somebody's job right I'm curious what are some of the weirder sounds that you have we have animals were animals like we have this one called the Jupiter mogollo and then we have another one called Azaria which is X a r y a h then getting to you no more play things like we have a 911 the ambience to 911 on 911 before 9/11 happened we have you know NASA spacecraft taking off you know these are things that cannot be recreated have some pretty out there sounds like here we play this one for you tell me if you can figure out what it is dog having nightmare this is Kohl's having nightmare this is called wolf eating wolf having nightmare the title of this lion having nightmare title of this this fire is Tiger copulation 76 180 play some has a new app and they want like a really unique notification sound they work with like tigermail they work with people that sounds like fun sorry to hear the sound of two tigers having sex they work with people who record animals and someone recorded that in there like they have got this catalog of animal sounds and this was just among them and they took the whole thing so like at this point I get that Pro sound effects is trying to have a sound effect for like every occasion but I'm really puzzled as to like what you Serebii for air conditioner with Japanese woman talking faintly behind it but first I wanted to play the song for Douglas just to see what he heard jail swamp what is swampy mean reverberant tones especially that I notice from like the footsteps just brought like swampy and also liked jelly type of it was like I couldn't tell it was like outdoor indoor but it kept those are the two thoughts that they came up so I asked Douglas like okay why would you guys have recorded something like this and he said we did requirements he also got his own from somebody else yeah so Pro sound effects does record sounds but they also like some sounds from other companies and this is one of those yes but Douglas was really eager to help us figure out where it came from and you know whatever we can do to support our neighbors just let us not like going to shoot me an email and you want to see what we can do to like track down the record to see what was really going on happy to do that so maybe two days after we went to be Douglas he sent me an email and he said I don't know who exactly recorded this but I do know two things one you was recorded before 2004 and to get is part of a library of sounds that weed license from a company called soundstorm okay so I looked up soundstorm and service company that record sound for movies and they did like they just don't like a lot of very prestigious movies they did like the fugitive and remember that Steven Seagal movie Under Siege so very prestigious fine did LA Confidential Dude Where's My Car you can't make it more than one movie in Alaska as part of a movie like maybe this Japanese woman is from a scene in a movie like they like put that down in there like 2 character like maybe and shine like all I have to do is contact Sandstorm Danny problem is soundstorm shut down 15 years ago after the break the creator of our Mystery Sound in the fall of the Berlin Wall this episode of reply all is bright You by Squarespace Squarespace makes it easy to create a beautiful website Alex Goldman you made website go for gripes.

He is very good at what he does because I played him that recording and he could hear all kinds of stuff that I couldn't hear so I can so I hear a little clunky side door and then I hear some footsteps there they're wet footsteps so if somebody is walking through a & Ally that is wet either from Rainier has a reason wet well it's either it's it's either wet or it's incredibly gritty the reason is that they I can hear the grit and and I'm pretty sure I hear a little tiny little bit of splashing on each footstep and I was like well that's why I called and he said also the way that is echoing it seems really narrow so it's either a court like a hallway or more likely it's like an alley right it's like totally change the image I had in my head of what was going on here but the problem is not only did Jay not remember this particular sound sound store in the company was made for shutdown decade-and-a-half ago the good news is Jay told me that he has a copy of the Sound Storm Library which includes more detailed information on each sound which means that he can go into that Library sounds find this original file and tell me once and for all hello who recorded the air conditioner sound hi Michael yes this is Alex Goldman I'm trying to get in touch with you because I got your your contact info from Jay I work for that radio Trail as asking about that sounds so yeah yeah yeah yeah how you doing good how are you good you have a moment to chat you need I'm kind of doing something but I'll be happy to call back is there a better time to call back today or tomorrow I mean let's just do it I mean I'm alright so but you're doing the podcast this is Michael drechsel he's primarily photographer now but he used to be a sound recorded at Sound Storm and I have to say he's honestly unlike anyone I've ever interviewed before and he told us that when she recorded this particular sounds the air conditioner sound that Halen heard in his Google home it was while he was working on a movie based in Prague and that movie is the 2002 Vin Diesel action thriller XXX really yes that does not sound like a sound that belongs in the XXX I know it doesn't what happened was I was working on the editing crew for XXX we were basically doing the soundtrack for it and in order to do that you usually do some specific recordings of sound effects of atmospheric sounds and all the bigwigs at the company were too scared to fly that was a year after 9/11 on it so since I'm German and I was going to visit my mom for Christmas they were all going like you're going to anyway why why don't you go to Czechoslovakia what the Czech Republic and and record some songs for us so I did so you grew up in Germany yeah I grew up in East Germany and and you know then when I was in my twenties I climbed the wall and got out of there just in West Berlin for a little while and said knock it down if I kind of need you know so Michael told me that when he tried to climb the Berlin Wall he got arrested he ended up spending two years in a Stasi prison and the second time you clean the Berlin Wall he was successful but he left his whole family behind and for 6 years it was almost impossible to see them we would occasionally need like in Czechoslovakia Hungary where they could travel it was always like a big production that sounds really hard but you know that's like what I always think like I'm so glad I had all this hardship it's like I say you know that when they go off terrible you know you were in prison and you know and all that and you know it to me it's kind of like I inherited a real big bunch of money in the bank and living off the interest and the interest is appreciation that I get every day and I still have it you know I sometimes go to the supermarket and this kind of Happiness rushes through me where I go I'm such a lucky dog I can buy anything I want you can just buy one isn't that great that's the reason I was laughing is because I you really passed that Rush of appreciation on to someone who has never been able to experience it before just now that's a really incredible exactly I mean I feel like that's why I have been exceptionally lucky a couple years after he got out of Germany Michael took a trip to the United States and while he was in LA he met some people want to kill Ministry and you just kind of stayed there that's how we ended up becoming a sound recordist and that's how we ended up working on XXX hooked up with an old friend of mine in Germany and we made a road trip out of it he still had his cause I said like how you want to be my assistant for a week we got to go and record some sounds and he was happy to do it so we took a little trip and stayed in Prague it was very cold I remember that and kind of moves around went to different places you know hunted for sound why do you have to go to the Czech Republic as opposed to just recording a sound and say Jersey City spoken language is completely unique and if there's a scene in a restaurant and it's in the Czech Republic then it will sound different from a restaurant in LA or New York or Berlin a the language is different the background in that is a really unique signature thing that people are usually not aware of but it makes for things being real or not real like a quiet Forest you drive somewhere and it's snowy and and you stopped and it's super quiet that's a rare thing it doesn't matter that much where that is recorded understands birds or something that might be identifiable you know you like that oh shoot is always in the pickers and nerds who are really into it are Russian okay he went to Prague to get Prague sound but the sound is a woman saying moshi moshi and Michael couldn't remember recording this specific sound but I spoke to a couple people who speak Czech and they told me that what we're hearing as moshi moshi is actually someone saying push me push gate which is a check for wait wait like wait up oh yeah and if you listen to it again like I could not hear the plosive sound of the beating of the words but I listen to it again and you can definitely hear put people to do once you know that that's what it is weird and also she may be cyclic wait wait Phillip weight really yeah okay so now we have woman walking down dingy Alleyway in Prague asking someone to wait up possibly a Philip and also there is one more thing that we got wrong about this recording which is what by the way I was thinking about this and I don't really remember recording it but I can tell you it was not an air conditioning and they cannot have been in the air conditioner because it was winter and it wasn't Prague so that some kind of offense of from a kitchen or something like that of course I just I have to say I love talking to you it makes me feel really happy and I really appreciate that and I'll tell some old stories hey if you ever come to La give me a buzz and then we can hook up that sounds great alright bye bye Alex by do I watch XXX to see if I could hear the air conditioner sound in it and I did not hear it Michael told me that it could be layered under you know 20 different sounds or he could have just recorded it and never ended up using it, what would your if you had like a custom house Goldman relaxation app yeah what sound would be the most relaxing for you the sound of me about to insult you it would be before you get burned it would be a swimming hole in this again synthesizer drone with like a filter sweep it really wanted endless shelter sweep I'm a simple man reply all has hosted by PJ
