hey everybody I'm excited to say that I like to spend the last hour or so in this beautiful Grove of trees recording a new interview for the second season of The Wild I'll be have a Shamu with you about that later but for now we got another bonus episode I want to share with you my full conversation with Florence Williams you might remember her from our episode on Forest bathing Florence is a journalist an offer she wrote an article in outside magazine about the benefits of time spent in nature is expanded that article into a book and the books titled the nature fix why nature makes us happier healthier and more creative. Conversation telling her about when I first came across her book I saw your book in the bookstore the other day and I recognized your name and I couldn't believe it because you wrote the article in outside magazine back in what year was not like 6 years ago was 13 I think yeah right Optical totally inspired my obsession with this subject no it was amazing so I'm at the bookstore and then the lady who wrote that has become famous in my life of pasta don't do so many people and I just became became the basis of this whole episode so so thank you and now you take it even further in your book on the subject and it's cooled nature fix and why that title is it something that's broken or is it something that what you know what what's broken or know what are you trying to fix yes I think we humans can use a little fixing you know we live a life that's so cut off from from nature and even from other authentic experiences right I think we all feel a little bit to plugged in sometimes and then like we can use some help but I also like the definition of fix a sort of a hit almost like a drug that when we go outside has medicinal qualities it has these mood-boosting qualities and we can infer how to get a fix I love it I feel already like I'm talking to a kindred spirit it's really great to talk to you about it I got some real specifics for you so in your in your article for outside magazine you went into what scientists in Japan of learning about how nature affects the human body on an on a physical level and where they were looking at the difference between walking in an environment setting it in and open setting and when walking in nature what did you what did they learn from that sort of experiment because they really were trying to figure out there for the data points were something measurable are there biomarkers in our body for what happens to us when we go into different environments and I'm so what they found is that even after this is a remarkable after just 15 minutes we know what they call Forest bathing outside in the woods and really what that means is just kind of opening all of your senses being very present so you're smelling the wonderful smells of the forest listening to the bird song in the leaves rustle feeling your breeze on the on your cheek even if it has 15 minutes of that there are finding this reduction in heart rate drop in blood pressure dropping stress hormones like cortisol some different weave through brain wave patterns when I first read this I was a little bit skeptical because I thought well sure you know people are just there outside and they're moving their exercising all but they're walking around in and we know that exercise is really clearly linked to sort of feelings of well-being right and restoration but the scientists are the control for that by also sending groups of people to walk around urban areas for the same mileage of the same amount of time and they really only saw he's her well-being effects in the forest walkers so it's kind of intriguing to me and even remember reading about you you what you writing saying that it would sound even the best of moods and lowering anxiety and I which which seems to be the last measurable in some ways but how would they have to know how it actually measuring that the physiological changes how do they do that to you know what they would like how are they measuring cortisol for example is truvision very fat kind of Q-tips that you suck on for a while and then you know they got some saliva in that and they can have that analyze pretty quickly for cortisol levels and then there are other machines they used to monitor things like heart rate variability that measures actually serve the difference between your heart beats I can tell how quickly you're responding to stress actually in real time and then you know basic pulse monitors there was a reason later that they think they can put on your headband for Summit some frontal cortex stuff but at the same time they have these you're pretty well-established measures in the field of psychology that are just questionnaires you know how would you rate your sense of frustration right now how would you rate your anxiety how would you rate your your shirt and another pretty well established and what they find in those questionnaires is that it really seems to correlate again to this walk in nature but not so much the walk in the middle of the city it makes that makes total sense right to those of us who spend time in Nigeria you always feel better after a war simple walk in the woods and it's this stuff is pointing the fingers to why that's the case right it's so interesting what was so interesting to me to is that we don't pay attention to how well we feel after a nature walk you know we tend to undervalue sometimes and then it has been shown another survey we undervalue how happy it makes us to be outside and we overvalue things like me on television or shopping which actually have these really transitory effects. I'm going to look at these questionnaires it's quite revealing because it's like oh wait a minute I actually felt really good when I was outside I told me in one of the messages I really try to convey in my book is that we all need to just pay a little bit more attention really pay attention to how we feel when we're in these different environment and then which elements are being outside speak to us you know we love the trees or do we like the coast do we like looking like sunsets now or do we like me looking at cool and sexy no on the sidewalk Tim's room knowing what really makes you happy and then spends more time doing that I love it I love it there's a great guidelines you know that it's a little bit like the wild the way we talked about it's different to everybody you know it can be sitting under a tree in the backyard or it can be in the deep in the wilderness in in in Alaska so the other thing that you know I was intrigued with you know the scientist to learning about these these the effects of nature on our immune systems as well and what what are they what are they finding out about the well yeah that's I met another researcher in Japan who is an immunologist and he's actually looking at these killer T cells which are part of our immune system killer T-cells are really important for fighting things like cancer in various infections and he specifically focused on these aerosols from the trees called fight on sides and he's are in a chemicals or emitted from tree I guess they're there especially through a potent and may be useful from the movies evergreen trees that they have in Japan like these hinoki cypress trees I'm It's a combination of these compounds like a limo that weed that smells wonderful this or smell like you know Christmas tree Meats VapoRub supposed to need no special substances and compound we make more killer T-cells actually boosts are immune cells out and that boost is remains quite high for 7 days after a visit to a forest but it also remains elevated after 30 days so you know what sort of a lower-level so you know this guy's name is Ching Li and he's right in his own book now in Forest medicine he recommends you know if you can go for a walk in the woods at least once a week and I'll get that high boost in amines elf but if you give me know if you can go once a month even that my might really help you out wow it's actually increasing our immunity and helping to fight off I'm not even right about fighting of chumas and potentially you didn't even a potential implications for the council right Britain enter other scientist who who are convinced that you know maybe it's not only about these bite on sides but but just this sort of Greater biodiversity right of of microbacteria battery in general in the forest these are things that humans evolved with weave bob with exposures to all these bacteria and yeast bacteria may also help us fight in a sort of illness or worst bacterial through the more biodiversity we can expose ourselves to on the better and that's it that's part of this hygiene hypothesis you know where kids who grew up on farms or in rural areas have fewer cases of asthma and allergies and things like that so I think that was another intriguing possibility and I think you know the science isn't really totally totally resolved on this issue there's still a lot to be done I'm a firm believer though I've got you be proud to know I've got a little vial of hinoki Cypress Oil on my bedside table thanks to you bought stock and hinoki the hotel after this conversation I know it I know they run an experiment to measure the effects of these sent these phytoncides that you told about can you describe what that was she sells in people after visiting a forest he also measured the the killer T cells in a Petri dish and he expose the sales in the dish to some of these substances found in the hinoki cypress tree that was interesting experiment I think he did was that he he put people in a hotel and they had to stay in the hotel for three days in their rooms and in half the rooms he missed it them with the snow he saw Christina coming out of mr. and in the other rooms they the new be just got missed it I think with water there some kind of controlled substance and he measured their killer T-cells before and after and he found us you know I'm statistically significant increase in these killer T-cells in the people who are in the nicely scented hotel rooms that really is a finding a walk in the woods get yourself a humidifier and some some some hinoki Cypress Oil right exactly I wish I was going to ask you about the you know what's been what have you seen as a result of this evolving research in Japan and how it how people responding there that there has been a slow sort of increased in the idea of nature as medicine so you see this medicalization of time outside where doctors are starting to prescribe it. Actually taking walks with their patients and again I don't think it's a huge huge Trend even in Japan but I think it is slowly sort of building if I'm a man and I think it is in this country to I heard recently that they're doing like 72 clinical practices in the United States where doctors are actually prescribing nature in time outside their patients I love it gets back to the title of your magazine article can you remind me what it was again take two hours of Pine Forest and call me in the morning so that all that's perfect to me as you can probably tell I'm excited about this subject matter and I think it's just a little such cool stuff for a hundred different reasons to me it's about reconnecting people with night Sharon helping them fall in love with it and then if they do not fit for the altruistic reasons great if you do it for selfish reasons great doesn't matter but I have the end I have to end up appreciating and protecting some of these wild places that they know that they need so I think this tons of stuff that's great about this it's also just very good for people I got to ask you what surprised you what a surprised you most about the research that you've done and Diving deep into this surprised that being outside makes us feel better about that at all or even that it makes us more creative one who lived and I lived in the mountains and Colorado and Montana for most of my adult life and I certainly know that I got some of my best ideas when I was outside I found you know some peace and calm about and if I didn't go out for the day I would feel feel grumpy later but I think one of the things that surprised me in the research is that nature can actually make us get along better with other people time outside that it can conserve make us better people as far as our self-concept and our sense of ourselves in our communities so there's been some really interesting new work on the science of aw a w e and that when we're in the presence of something so beautiful and mysterious you know like an incredible sunset in a looking at a Mountaintop or even just something as simple as you know a butterfly kind of surprising us right in our path it pulls us out of our own heads and makes us feel like we're part of something larger what's in a souffle survive he's going to say it but it turns out that that that that concept of being pulled out of ourselves it's really really important to our sense of well-being and to our psychology and if you think about it it's not something that we really experienced very often in these lives you know where we live sort of isolated and indoors and maybe we see a cool video on Facebook or something in general were not exposed to the kind of author found in nature that that we were now in a more primitive life when we really lived outside and there's something about that experience that seems to be very very important for not only feeling like we're part of something larger in terms of nature but they were part of a larger Community as well so I was really interested in exploring this idea of how it's a Wilderness is actually good for civilization because it makes us feel like we are part of a community that we have a responsibility to each other and in Studies have shown this that that even in a lab after looking at photographs of like a waterfall or of a whale that we behave in ways that are more generous to other people like will play some kind of you know computer game after looking at these photos and and we were better teammates would give away more lottery tickets we give away more money to charity each other in ways that that the researchers have a measuring for of altruism and it seems like it's a really partially impacted by this feeling of off seems like the list of things that nature, do for us is very short you know what I mean there's so many angles to this I could sit and listen to you all day about all this stuff cuz I it's almost like you say when you bring it down to the future of civilization Pop's rest in power on our relationship with nature and wild places wow that's quite something is net and it's also I have say little bit discouraging away because you know I can sense you know our kids are getting more and more disconnected from HR all the time our cities are getting less of green and more paved over all the time I have this weird joke that we should have a ficus campaign where everyone gives their congressperson you know a potted Palm or some kind of plant to bring a little bit of biophilia into Congress you know so that that they actually start getting along better with each other and actually getting things done already good for throat yes I like it when I voiced you have the people to get the most out of what Nature has to offer like if someone is listening in I'm up what it what are they think I'm in love with the part that busy daily life what would you say to them to to to to help guide them to get the most out of nature from what you've learned I really simple advice and that's just to go outside and to go often and then also you know bring young people with you if you can because I think connecting this next generation is just challenging right they are third there inside all the time there so many Temptations on for all of us to be indoors more and so I think it's kind of like I hate to say it because it doesn't make it sound very attractive but it's sort of like eating your vegetables you know once we acknowledge and understand that nature makes us better people it makes it more productive and makes more creative makes us sleep better makes us get along with our loved ones better you know once we really believe that and understand it I think we will put more emphasis Onnit will make it a priority it actually will just make us better at what we do it's not sort of taking us away necessarily from other things so I don't like to look at it as if you know as an either-or like yet another item for our to do Lyft but actually this is a way to enhance the other things that we do in the rest of our lives will you someone who spent a lot of time in nature and have you started to spend more time in nature as a result of These Fine on the 11th floor of an apartment building in New York City in Manhattan but in those days you know kids could run sort of wild right in the seventies and eighties and I lived a few blocks from Central Park was actually in Central Park almost every day I was running around or playing soccer or doing whatever riding my bike and my dad also happen to be the total Wilderness guy like he loved canoeing we had a van and we used to move into the van in the summer and drive out west and go canoeing all these refers to had this funny and duality of we know very urban life and then it's like Wilderness and Wilderness life that was totally unplugged totally off road and having that juxtaposed view point where they are kind of used to feel like confused about it I was like Amaya City girl or am I a nature girl and which one am I in town about it and it's realize you know what it's okay to be a little bit of both I don't have given them both at the same time I can love being in a city and have a great time and then you know I can I can go somewhere now on a vacation or that's not always easy I can make it a priority to really need to get out a little bit every day I thought that's what I do and yes I do make it more of a priority I do do it more I end up walking my dog in the parks in Washington DC like a literally every single day I have to go out for even if it's just 30 minutes I've got to do it I hear you I'm the same y'all even if I got periods of time when I'm not out in the wild I've got to find a little peace of wild here you know my office you would laugh is just full of plans it looks like you walking into a rainforest you know so another thing that you helped Inspire Florence so thank you so much thank you so much for joining
