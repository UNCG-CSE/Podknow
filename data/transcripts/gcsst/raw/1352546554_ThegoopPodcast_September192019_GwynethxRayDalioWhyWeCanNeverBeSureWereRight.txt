luxury skincare for years now I've sworn by the group beauty products and other cleanbrands which deliver the same results or better than the conventional options but I think Hair Care has been lagging behind which is why I was curious to hear about a new clean hair care line designed in the salon of one of the world's top hairdressers Frederic Fekkai it's called the pure collection from the one I tell ye Fekkai Jean Godfrey June my executive Beauty editor turned us on to the shampoo and conditioner and Mist which we now have stopped in the goop shop the pure collection is made with 95% natural ingredients and includes soothing ingredients like aloe vera there are no sulfates parabens or silicones and is Gene likes to say it's no compromise because the products really work they smell

shampoo conditioner or mist when you are pioneering anything or introducing new ideas to the culture affected and we made it the one instead of being kind of love people understand each other as if by Magic is an emptiness in that person that needs to be filled I now know that nobody changes until they change their energy when you change your energy you change your life I'm going to tell true this is the goop podcast bringing together thought leaders culture Changers creatives Founders and CEOs scientists doctors healers and Seekers here to start conversations because simply asking questions and listening has the power to change the way we see the world can we go my guest today is Ray dalio Ray is the founder of Bridgewater Associates which is one of the world's largest hedge funds he's also an incredible investor and philanthropist I learned so much from Ray's brilliant book principles and even more from talking to him all the way and I talked a lot about business the conversation leaned more towards the emotional than you'd expect there's a very spiritual aspect everything Ray does his approach to business is very different for one he's made a commitment to radical transparency both personally and throughout his company which means that everyone is encouraged and powered and expected to speak straight which can be very difficult and also very rewarding as you hear from right you were going to be one of two camps you're either going to love knowing or you're going to love not knowing if you love knowing and you're attached to knowing it'll stand in the way of your learning right because if you love not knowing and not taking it in and the kick of learning okay that'll be your pleasure let's get to our conversation obviously your book is called principles and you clearly articulate what your principles are and how they have shaped your philosophy and you know you have led to your incredible success if if you had to design sort of the overarching principles for the country right now in terms of the direction you would want it to go in what would those principles be the most fundamental principles are the ability to think for yourself to get what you want out of life and at the same time work with others to understand the art of thoughtful disagreement and how to get past thoughtful disagreement to the pursue the things that you collectively want cuz we're so at an impasse right now and it seems so binary and this is what one of the aspects about you that I find so fascinating is that you've developed a system of communication the well-documented at Bridgewater around this kind of collaborative communication which sometimes seems like it can be quite painful and astonishing to me that somebody so successful would embody something in practice something which would constantly be inherently so diminishing to the ego like you told the story about in the summer just graduating school around your table apnea very young woman who had given you a very low score on whatever it was the topic that you were discussing and as a boss who has spent years doing this like how do you how does that culturally work how do you take feedback like that how is it not triggering I think there's a big lesson in that for everybody to understand wolf Crystal I'd like to explain why it's sensible to do that right and then once you see that it's sensible for doing to do that then the question is what stands in the way of doing the sensible thing so well it's sensible to do that because first of all I don't know the ever that I'm right so getting that feedback is important but even is important is that she believes something that's not right that that that I'm doing something badly and what do I want her to do what kind of relationship do I want her to have do I want her to just walk off there and just be obedient and just be a follower and not wrestle with those things I want to bring it out so that she gets empowered and that we get in sync about what's true and if I create a culture that way where you always have the right to speak out the right to make sense of things and to work yourself through disagreement well I'm going to have thinking people who will think that the system is fair and we can move forward a better way to have an idea meritocracy so it's certainly a sensible thing to do it it's extremely rare and do you realize how few rich white powerful men are capable of having that capacity of maturity and able to hold something like that extremely wear and I know all those things are true and then I think it's true about a lot of groups that have no that's okay but I'm that's why I said now I want to get into the why do the why I want to understand how I'll be only because it is very rare for somebody especially in a leadership position like that to be able to hold that kind of criticism so how do you do that first one I realize that you're so stupid not to do it I mean the second thing is that I think that they were to use the way I think about it there is the upper-level you which is The Logical you and then there's the subliminal emotional you that subliminal in its really with Freud's great breakthrough was the discovering that there is a subliminal you okay and the subliminal you is really controlling you but because it's not conscious you're not even aware of it and so the issue is to reconcile those two most people have an emotional challenge an offset hearing criticism the brain interprets at like an amygdala it's this fight or flight thing that I'm being attacked and it's reinforced so much in our education system in the way were operating where did you have the right answer are you smart or all of those things rather than might you be missing something important why should you believe that just because you have an opinion that that's a right opinion that happens to be the one in your head and so if somebody disagrees with you how do you know that you're not the one who's so when you start to realize that you raise your probabilities by testing whether you're wrong you raise your probabilities of making better decisions right now and that works so there's an emotional impediment but it only temporary it's happened we are so driven by habit write what you change your habit everything changes so you can change this happen and when you create a culture in which people believe it's fair that they demanded and then you have to create a methodology a real system that enables it then you can achieve that and that is the key to the exceptional results right I started out with a two-bedroom apartment and describing it out one more look less kid went to college public college and school and all that and then had two bedroom and what I what we did is we had this idea meritocratic way of operating and that's what I want to pass that will yell it started pretty much from the outside because first of all if I'm having a partnership I start up with how do I want to be with you and how should we be with each other everybody's got to decide how do you want to be with each other and you have to have ground rules so I wanted an idea meritocracy so you going to have disagreements and when you have disagreements you have to have a protocol for what do you do how do you get past that disagreement you have to have a protocol so I started off with that and also I'm living in a world where I'm never sure I'm right and that's the power but again very very incredible incredible degree of maturity because you could look at your career and somebody could quantifiably say like this guy's always right I mean new you know if you have to look at my career I wouldn't have been where I am over that had that track record if I didn't do this thing so I'm trying to pass that along to other people to say if you do this thing you can have the power when you start to realize that all the answers don't have to be in your head okay you can tap anything around you all right if you know how to freeze nipple triangulate well with people find the smartest people who you know maybe get I use a triangle like maybe it's three smartest people you know ideally those who disagree with you and understand their reasoning and if they disagree with each other and and you work yourself through that you significantly raise your probabilities of being right because you have the right to make decisions but it's stupid not to make the decisions by taking the best that you can have and having it make sense to you try to determine who's right out of the three people well I think they would describe it in in a simple example would be supposing you have some disease what are you going to do you can decide yourself what you're going to do or you can go to three different. You can go to one then you go to the second and he has a different opinion okay this is good now you're going to experts and you have a different opinion now focusing on why there is a different opinion between them you hear the back and forth at the end of those three that exercise of three you will make a decision and the smartest way to make that decision is to believability way the decision you listen to everybody but you're going to think about who was the best expert what did they do to make success did it make sense to you was it logical okay now what do I do to go ahead if they're at odds you focusing on that so what we do is we have a system which we call believability waiting believability waiting so it all we've done is to systemize that process so by knowing what people are like and their strengths and weaknesses which we collect from data and other reasons another ways and we do that kind of triangulation we raise our chances of being right stuff to describe it in a couple of sentences but that's basically how we do it but the key most importantly is that mindset that you come to a discussion with which views thoughtful disagreement as disagreement as a curiosity with the notion that it's somebody might be wrong and it might be you and curiosity motivates that triangulation so if you're in a situation where you've heard multiple opinions differing opinions and are you the tiebreaker I want to be clear that I almost don't care about the conclusions as much as I care about the reasoning right that you're using but there but in answer to your question about who makes the decision there is the protocol going through that process I'm watching a person make the decision and then the person has certain decision rights there many decisions that I'm not the person because I'm not the best person to make that decision it might be I don't know what might be a legal decision of my being accounting question it might be whatever it is mine knowing what I don't know is more important than anything I know and so by being able to put into positions those people who are the best at making those decisions then they have a protocol and I have a protocol which is that protocol to watch everybody watches it and by the way it's all on video wee-wee video on audio record everything so everybody can see things for themselves so that way they don't know that they know there's no spell and so by being able to do that people see are you operating in that kind of way where you're bringing it out you're doing the believability I don't think there's ever been a case that I have out voted I use my power to overcome a believability weighted decision and when you have listened to all of the reasoning is your desired decision tend to be data-driven or intuitive both very important subject which we call which is intuitive versus logical and that has to do with what's coming from the subliminal mind and what's coming from the conscious logical mind those are the two use again and I think it's very important that realize each can be right in each could be wrong and by reconciling them is the best way to make a decision so like if we have intuitive I want to do this intuitively that could be emotionally where I want do it intuitively that might be a great inside because great insights come from the subliminal mind and an intuitive way and at the same time you're at a situation where it's so smart to double-check it with the logical mind so if you can bring them into alignment you're going to make a better decision because a lot of subliminal emotional decisions have caused a lot of pain too so bringing them in line I would say meditation has had an enormous effect on my approach to decision-making started meditating in 1969 and I think that that's had a big effect on my approach to things in a recommended to log people out of people at it's helped them even in our company in my experience I do TM to when I am not interrupted by my children or whatever the case may be but I think that it's an incredible tool for creating that sort of pause we know where the ego kind of does diminish of it and I think that's what you all have to put into practice when you have your I mean cuz radical transparency in practice and really speaking straight requires a kind of you know being able to pause and hold and not be triggered and not react and understand you're doing something for a higher exploration sort of almost the ability to go above it it's a feeling like I'm now above and I'm looking down on me with in my circumstances and then it allows me to say shoot it operate so that it works well for the whole rather than to be in it you know when you're in it and that that is where it's standing away so I'm sure if you how long have you practiced I learned about 9 years ago I claim as is it brings you into your subconscious mind because they the meditation itself you are as you know you're no longer conscious and you know not unconscious so you go into subconscious mind and in your subconscious mind that's will so where creativity comes from so you're opening up your connection between your subconscious mind and your conscious mind and that flow helps me and I'm sure helps you so when when we were talking about that that's what triggered my thought about meditation because I was saying that reconciliation taking an upgrade subliminal and the emotional with the intellectual is so great and it is something though that it can be achieved through meditation so I know that it allowed me to align those so if I can align my subliminal emotion with my intellectual and I can online that with the right triangulation with smart other people I'm about to make much better decisions and if I'm just stuck within my head one of the most fascinating aspects of that to me when I look at sort of your larger philosophy right is that so internal and so kind of hard to quantify and it's so intimate and human and then on the other side you've imagined created technology your created technology to do the exact opposite and a way sort of to take or not the opposite but to take that integrated human part and put it put ones and zeros to do it and then create a system right where you can roll bad in a scientific way the dog collector is a means by which and that everybody expresses themselves continuously through a meeting so rather than a normal meeting in which it's all in people's heads and only one person can talk at a time we have an ability by easily putting the information that we can see what everybody's thinking Side Motel in real time on the screen okay so everybody's knowing what everybody's thinking real-time on a screen about each other and about what's going on what are the kind of metrics that they're using like in other words so are they rating people on quality of idea communication creativity attention to detail determination any of those things or you can ask skill in their area anyting that they can fully Express themselves in a very easy way and then also I can communicate anybody was running one of these meetings can then communicate with everybody or anyone who in the meeting wants to ask a question can I ask a question to anybody and know what everybody's thinking so you go from thoughts in the head to then that thinking and then all that produces also data another words that helps to express how people think and it's fascinating the dad is fascinating because you see how people see. red light right they see differently we don't know how people see think you can't imagine how differently people see things at the same time unless you see it and through this device you see it and then you got to walk by and you then you learn how you see and sew people do this also as a personal Discovery process so that it's very interesting to them to see uh I see things in this way this other person see things in that way and that's an enormous effect on our quality of our communication before that and before we did also some personality tests that help to express how people see people would get frustrated with each other you don't like the big picture thinker would say what is that person paying so much attention to the details for and the detail thinker would say what can that person just get Gaston granular and so but then they start to understand and also by the way all those different ways of thinking are valuable nature gave us everything for a reason there's always a reason and all those different ways of thinking have reasons and so to be able to put together a team in which there is an appreciation of those differences so that you know in order to be successful that you need all those different ways of thinking it's extremely powerful and I'm personally beneficial that's amazing to me like I don't know why I just flash on this but I was in Italy last summer and there's this amazing Duchess and she has this garden and she doesn't spray it and she doesn't pull weeds she says the whole ecosystem of the garden is what makes it function it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen and it was this Meandering she doesn't plant straight because bees don't fly straight was just a strut I'm with you with nature because nature creates this gorgeous echosystem of the way it should be and then people take their prejudices and they line the flowers up in a row one Bush after another in this way it's a count they can't tolerate other opinions and they can't do you think we're like that I don't know I think we're halfway between animal and God in our Evolution or revolution what I mean by the animal I don't think animals have any problems with this now I agree they just go out there and they do it and they're in harmony with nature and it's all the way it should be and they don't ask themselves questions and we are then thinking about how things should be and so on but we had haven't fully evolved to being totally you know if you would imagine God and the all-knowing or or fully evolved then you would say that they would be the harmony of those things but we wrestle with ourselves and we wrestle with nature I think I think that's right I think we're especially right now in time and space I think we're wrestling so much with each other with nature well that's why we could just step back from that right and go above it and say that's our problem right so now how do we have the art of thoughtful disagreement so that we can get past our disagreements and go on from there so it comes back to basics can we agree on what are most important principles are what can we agree on WhatsApp greats ourselves and how do we get past our disagreements to be a better hold because if we fragment ourselves and hurt each other we're in the process of hurting each other then we're going to be in a prop that we're all going to be worse off maybe you should run for president if there's a whole problem in the political system and everything is in there I mean I think maybe you should write this book The Art of thoughtful disagreement everything I thought about that is pretty much expressed in principles and I did give it away as a free app so does anybody who wants it can go on at School principles in action very interesting so the book plus videos that take us into actually this happening is free online at the Apple App Store so it's free I'm going to have people are interested then you license that. What's it called I'm going to make it free for everybody open-source I remember reading in your book it struck me that you are so early in creating algorithms so I think I should probably convey to your listeners this reality because we're living in a world of algorithms and it's going to increase and it's very important to understand it's it'll be a long time before any computer is going to have the imagination of a human being okay human beings can imagine and they can understand in unique ways relative to a computer but they can't process anywhere near the what the ability of the computer so your brain should be used for imagining and understanding but everything related to processing should be put into a computer and the world that worrying is decision making is going to be totally different think about it it in the world that were used to it if we're playing chess the way for me to play chess is I make a move and you make a move and we make that in our decision-making in that way in the future the right way to play chess is to make a decision making criteria for those moves and a better get into a computer and then in parallel use that computer in parallel with us to make the decisions and when you do that you create so much empowering and you don't lose understand that you gain understanding and you gain imagination so that's what I found very powerful I described that in the beginning you asked me about this way of operating in this ID America private Webbie that is been absolutely critical and meditation 02 absolutely critical the other thing I would say is if I could convey a message it would be to know your principles principles and systematic decision-making so if you write down what are your principles what are the best decision rules when faced in situations it will help you so much because the same things happen over and over again so how should we deal with each other it what are principles for doing that each one of the things what are our principles for making decisions it'll change the way you think because rather than seeing a bunch of things that are coming at you you will almost see it as a different species of things that are coming at you another word you'll say all it's another one of those and like what species is it and how do I best handle that species so the operating at a principal level together with operating it with you systematic decision-making is is is really something and if I'd say any success that I've had in life has been because of that and I guess I also knowing that how One deals with one's not knowing is so much more important than anything one knows it's also true I mean for me anyway I started this business I had no idea what I was doing and 10 years ago and well I started monetizing about 5 years ago and I had a real embarrassment around my ignorance around certain things especially certain acronyms or if there was so much to learn and there was so much I didn't know and at a certain point you know instead of trying to Google like what is SAS business under the table or whatever I was trying to do to just embrace the vulnerability and say I don't know the answer to this it doesn't mean that I'm not intelligent I just means I'm ignorant for right now and I can learn this expression I'm a dumb shit to the fact that I'm a dumbshit now can we go on from there therefore if we establish the fact that I'm a dumb shit then we get past this view that okay you're judging me based on I know and I'm okay no let me just as I'm a dumb sure what I had to do and that's why you see the eagle barriers is such a bad thing right yes it's very powerful and very negative you were going to be in one of two camps you're either going to love knowing or you're going to love not knowing if you love knowing and you're attached to knowing it'll stand in the way of your learning right because if you love not knowing and not taking it in and the kick of learning okay that'll be your pleasure you don't be attached to the knowing you know that's really it's very very profound do you would you consider that one of your principles and I mean I know you have your sort of main ones that you've articulated but are there other principles like that those are kind of know if I was to say overarching those are them and now let's take a short break the pure collection from the one I tell you if a guy is a pic from our executive Beauty editor Jean Godfrey June the brains behind this line is Frederic Fekkai the world's famous hair stylist to Pioneer luxury hair care two decades ago and now he has his first collection of luxury clean hair care SG inputs at Frederick has been working with hair for decades and his salons and workshops known as I tell you a Fekkai because of this he's tried everything and he only uses products that deliver great result he also happens to be from Provence and according to Jean he's the OG source for French girl hair and he's always loved and believed in the power of Nature & Botanicals after a lot of research and testing Frederick came up with the pure collection which stands out because it's entirely clean this is why you'll find the shampoo conditioner and missed from the pure collection in the goop shop the line is made with 95% natural ingredients like soothing aloe vera there are no sulfates parabens or silicones and products actually work they are extremely high performance and they smell great and I love your hair looking great you can find a pair collection in a group shop or you can head to the one by folk i.com if you're on their side just enter goop I check out to get 20% off your purchase of the Pure shampoo conditioner mist okay let's get back to the conversation do you think that we are part of the process of life is defining your own principles is it okay so it's not there is not a there no common denominators and principles for every single person know however let's say there are Timeless and Universal truths and very good principles that people who would do anything successfully have and you want to understand them you don't want to be a possessive you don't have to invent all the principles in the world you can take them from others and embrace that we all learn like if I don't know somebody's a great skier somebody's a great parent somebody's a great whatever they are you want to glean them from others and also think for yourself but at the end of the day that you have to internalize them and say that they are whatever wherever they come from from you you or wherever they come from you have to find the things that work do you think that there are certain principles that are axioms for all high-achieving successful people I think that there are a lot of commonalities I'm not sure that you can get back to everyone what I did was I gave tests I get personality profiles to shaffer's what's a shaper Bill Gates Elon Musk people who went from visualization to actually sang another words somebody was I visualize something and built out something great right and so when I think about what what are the different approaches I decided to know number of shape right personality test and then talk to them to try to find okay what is it that are the common ingredients to make them extraordinarily successful of the the vision and the building it out and so when you asked me that question that's what comes to mind and what am I well there's there's just a whole bunch of them but their adventurous curious but adventurous they like going into the unknown there imagine isn't like Risk tolerance differently than you might View Restaurant different people view risk but that's a word they risk having their life be less great than it could be that's risk okay risk somebody else might say I risk failing I risk embarrassing myself okay they risk not doing all they can do and being all that they can be they don't mind falling they don't they do that is part of the process like the Thomas Addison approach you fell fast and sales board that's the idea so what is risk the ability to be full range or the work with people who are full range because to be aspirational imaginative and at the same time be down into the nitty-gritty detail and execution they are practical and dreamers at the same time you can't be just a dreamer and you have to be that practical they love the evolutionary process one thing that's controversial is that they hold people accountable for a high standard all that controversial well I'll tell you why it was controversial on the personality test is just a part of the test that is called workplace inventory there's one of the tests and on it there's a test that isatis they're called concern for others and it sounds like it's empathy concern for others but I gave it to Muhammad yunus who received the Nobel Peace Prize for microfinance and all of East receive the Congressional Medal of Honor all these awards for what he has given to humanity a man who thinks nothing about himself relative to others I gave it to Geoffrey Canada Harlem children's Zone who operates in and dip these people who are very self-sacrificing and have high concern for but what happens is when they what years what it is when faced with the choice of hurting somebody's feelings or achieving the mission they will put achieving the mission first so they'll be tough on others it's a big deal right when you start to realize that there are emotional barriers and that people's personal Evolution it's What I Call Tough Love cuz it's it can also be the way the way that you can deliver something can appendicitis in the way as well right like that you want to live or something very tough but in a loving way that's right but still tough love is so much tougher than easy line now but but it it's good for us you don't get to the thing about nature one of the Great Tricks of nature is that the first order consequences are opposite the second-order consequences meaning the thing it's almost like nature place a trick on us I think like the foods that we most want to eat or the things that we most want to do that are most appealing are often the worst forms it's almost has a negative correlation the second order concerts are like I do love that's that's me at a bar I like dirty martinis with that olive juice in those out one bottle of but that second order consequence so it's the trick so you have to get almost go to the pain and almost pain could be made pleasure when you start to realize like playing an exercise with habit becomes the pleasure that's applicable to a difficult interpersonal dynamics of how do I how does one get better at that I think first of all we have to do until I actually have to agree that that's true you have to intellectually believe something then you have to see that it's your upper level you in the conflict with your lower level emotional you and that other people are having the challenge and then you have to have the technique and the technique we talked about goes back to starting with the higher level and saying how should we be with each other like do you want me to tell you what I think I did I say something similar I say like do I have permission to speak straight or NSYNC I think these things what do you want me to do what do you think we should do here cuz that brings you above the situation so that you were going about how we should be with each other cuz intellectually than ul's the person will say of course I wouldn't you know not what I should walk out of it you're ignorant about that thing is it what you're inherently saying to the higher-level south of the person is I need you to come forward like I need your highest self to come forward when they hear that right like can we agree on that we're going to have this type of discussion it's like that immediately choose you to bring your highest self forward that's why they have to use write the faster you realize that because then you start to see all it's my lower level me if you start to realize it's your lower level you then you don't think you want because you realize the upper-level you might want one thing and your lower-level you might want something else so then you have to think upper-level you what do you want do you want to talk about this or what should I do in this position but that's a great question it's a human what should I do about the fact that we're in this predicament in essentially it's your fault will I don't know whose fault it is let's talk talk to you then can if you're if you never quite know what the truth is or who's right how do you come to the conclusion that somebody's not the right person for the business anymore will it goes back to what I was saying before you have certain decision rights and then how do you triangulate with others to get to the most believable decision so if somebody's working with you you have a job they have a job okay they report to you that's your situation so put you in your situation now you're in the situation that you described as a difficult situation which is a difficult situation for most people so well then you say listen it is my responsibility to run this company and to do the best that I can along those lines and I have thoughts and there should be no questioning that I that we should be having this conversation at dealing with this right and you you describe that to the person and then I like to do it in a way where if I need to do that if there's triangulation we're okay well you know how do you achieve it but in any case to not have that conversation would be bad for everyone right yes and you may make that clear they go yes with equal enthusiasm okay and then you have it I had one last question okay I'll ask you something really stupid and where to rent rudimentary for my son's 13th birthday I opened a electronic trading account for him he's very interested he's very interested in stock market so how can I encourage him to create principles for himself around this and what are what would you tell him like if I if if he were here he's up he's going to make his first trade what should he do lied about the way I did the same thing at 12 I took Mike adding money and mother money I earned and I did the same thing very well so most importantly go into it with the fun the adventure and so on try not to get blown out and use curiosity as your guide to how you should do better another words start to probably on the line you go to the different places and and gather information and think realize who I wish I could speak with him a bit maybe I will do that that the markets are based on what everybody's bat is of what's likely to happen and it becomes discounted in the markets because it's too technical but if it's a great company a great company may do worse than a terrible company because it's like a gray horse in a horse race doing worse than a bad horse in a horse race because the betting odds change so they that horse has got to do better than the bedding and not versus if that works horse did better than is expected they would do well in the markets are like that but I wear that's a detail I would say go in have the adventure think about up and down bedding will something go down you could do well if it's something goes down cuz you can learn how to sell short as well as to that on things going up and just play and so I can ask questions play and ask questions thank you so much this is been so incredibly enlightening fun for me too thanks for listening to my chat with Ray dalio I love getting to explore how his principles have shaped his philosophy and ultimately led to such success make sure to check out Rays book
