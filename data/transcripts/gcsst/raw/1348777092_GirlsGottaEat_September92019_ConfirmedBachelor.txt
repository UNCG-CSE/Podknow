Confidential as all right. Guest nervous about the first intro on his apartment so and that the house studio with us and do we have our very first visitor from a bachelor Nation he was on The Bachelorette JoJo season and he also is on its current season of Bachelor in Paradise all of you slid into RDM is about him and welcome to the house Studio at Derek Pace talk me up like that welcome to the studio. stupid idiot here and we couldn't get someone more famous so you're here you roast me so hard last night though I was like we'll make it work any day of the week anytime you go this is real desperate here we are 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning you had for expressos doubles I made you two doubles I don't feel great been here for an hour and a half to talk about how we're going to talk about this I don't know I didn't say this number who is this and play Magic I didn't actually think you would explain Ashley a green egg make sure he's kind of fucking weird I don't know her like that she needs it show me the screenshot. A huge fan of the franchise I watched every episode is my favorite season of anything's because he's about to Paradise has been so incredible I feel like this is really what took you to the next last ball like you became like an icon on the season people want you to be the bachelor all the kind of stuff I want to stay right up top of that this is not going to be a total Bachelor Bachelor in Paradise podcast episode of at the end we're going to ask all these questions of people submitted so it'll come up but like if we know you guys want to know all these things and we crowdsource questions we're going to do it at the end is our little game with you. Talk about it at all what time are your Finance job yeah I work for a bank and I got a big thing is student loan refinance so I had to travel around 2 Hospital systems like bigger companies and sell student loan refinance like a lower price for employers go to cool events and then never sleeps live two lives I live too much to do a live a double life like I don't know do you know of other Bachelor Bachelorette people that still doable. Career most people either like fade away or they decide to go all the way into it so I have weirdly like crossed you're not like pushing sugarbearhair vitamins but you're like you know how their holier-than-thou I would never do that kind of stuff but that's just stupid it's free money that people are offering you like why would you money but I'm not so I'm going to take this free money also have you ever heard of commercials like this is how I feel like I pay for us exactly this phone it's not free so you were on JoJo's season what we already talked about this before we start recording I think she's the hottest outside of all time so you got lucky there and then when was that was it like 2017 or in a couple years old once again and I've ever since then I quit my job to do that same job the story sorry I cut you off the story of how you actually got in the show is interesting cuz I need a lot of people that are dying of on reality shows like that a bag gyro right kind of fuckboys my little sister is my little sister and her friends watch a show and then I drink wine and I was actually living in Florida at the time my little sister sent my information in and they called in like the middle of my work day and young board Anna bank and somebody calls and she likes kindness is Kelly from The Bachelor just want to know if you're still single and am I had him going this is not a normal for like this is not an actual call I'm getting this has to be out somebody prank calling me the morning radio show whatever and sound like you have my email yeah I just emailed me and hung up the phone like that what the whole franchise was like we got to get on Chris Harrison's like put me on the first two hours to come to some I don't know what they were they don't even know what they call him the casting calls it was two blocks away from my work hotel with paper I didn't personally the other people they are but but they like yeah they had the camera set up in a hotel room and now this sounds like something this is a Harvey Weinstein situation I'm getting right and there is a Collier so comfortable in front of a camera and I'm going to answer because I don't care if I do need to shut up exactly especially not for anybody out there whoever does the whoever wants to go stop trying so hard and 30 everything I guess that's what we tell me to ask for like if you want a guy to like you just do nothing nothing love yourself baby hang up on them give me your email and hang up no you can get my email I'll email you my Instagram handle what was your relationship life before that are you newly single for a while back and forth with this one girl for seems like 6 years and both of us are just a horrible to each other not in that actually not mean to each other but we were just feel like I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you and then and then we we like there's this other person I'm going to go try things out with and just see because I'm not sure about this yet but yeah it was 6 years that man so then when they called outside just like I like this will be the final cut to be like I'm going to quit this job I'm going to move from Florida life is going to change yeah okay and you had a pretty good a real relationship from Bachelor in Paradise like I was like a Taylor you guys were like a real doll for sure I know some probably are less real than others like you guys had a relationship right and I think I'll always be the person I'm assuming who waited the longest or knew somebody the longest before the engagement happened cuz we did a thing like after show everybody else says it at during the show so like paradise as whatever dog for weeks of recording and like The Bachelorette like 10 weeks this is like four months of dating basically before we did that so it was like a definitely a relationship going gagement what's up how was your night I had a perfect day to do that then once I did that I had like eight friends who I didn't even know that they've been engaged at some point in time where I'll just like we get it it sucks and we're here for you I never knew anybody cuz I was a little younger when it happen to me I was 27 and that agent I mean I just didn't know anybody didn't go through it and so I was like so humiliated and I would never tell anybody and people would be like what do you bring us up on a day and I feel like never today I'm like it's just the past I know and I don't know I don't think that should matter I don't think you should lie but I don't think you need to open with it with it I think if it comes up when you're dating somebody getting to know each other it's comes up exactly like but I think we always will talk about this like it's weird if somebody's like purposely omitting information for life but it sounds like a high I don't think I think also accept the kids too so I think that's a wall people put up sometimes cuz I'm friends with kids and I like I always tell people right away okay but I think you're that's a definite no for a whole lot of people you're probably like pushing people away who would maybe be like once they meet you once even though I really like this person and I paid by the way I have a I have a kids do you make them want the product first before I like okay I understand totally with you though like I think that is your own knitting information that's a little you live with your kids and like for your whole lot life all day long as your kids and you don't bring it up for three dates it's a little bit. Ceragioli part of your life that I've heard six months before she found out and then went home with him for the holidays and then someone brought up the kid the kid like live with Mom absent father he said seeing the kid while they've been dating it was crazy but engagement thing is not like a part of your all day life every day so I could see ride up with me on a date on the first date and I was like I don't want to talk about this this is weird for me about you and them right it's not about the new person either immediate rain dancer I've never wanted to get into it because like an old woman that I don't think on her side we should like bring up and crying their eyes of anybody in the show for the most mature I mean you're probably older than some of these living true so I think you came across the great but I want to talk about this today in general and I episode of like just putting it out there was straight is the weirdest thing to hear about when you do this cuz you just like first of all I mean I was just like living my life and second of all of when people say that it's usually because some shit happened to you like the popular person that didn't have anything happen is like in the background like oh yeah you weren't there but the person that they're like you came across great service-level like you were a person I enjoyed watching and I you weren't like a dramatic, for TV person situation and drama and look up very calm wagonlit people like I'm on reality TV I'm ready to bake a shitbag of all time I feel like more so than you have been the past a little bit like people were like really and we'll get this at the end like Derek for bachelor's I want top of this is generally putting yourself out there I feel like you really put yourself out there and there was like some rejection talk about it for sure obviously it's hard anytime you get rejected that sucks and obviously I'm still single and I want to be in a relationship now in my thirties now like this route to sign free also grew up in Iowa which means from the time I Was Eighteen people like I'm going to get married to your girlfriend I'd like to find friends after high school getting married to their high school sweetheart like you do want to get married and have kids someday and sooner than later honestly I'm here for you you're welcome cuz it's more than what did you feel like it was difficult especially on TV I think I like once you once you're there for a couple of days you'd actually isn't forget about the cameras cuz will you have to or you're playing shut up and then like I said it's really easy like you see that these things or people that are acting or whatever like if you're just yourself you way more comfortable with adding after the fact that that you just like where you were going to give you two different people if you're trying to play different characters I guess it's really hard to keep straight in your head too if seen it before in the people that snap and freaked out I think usually is because of that cuz they're like trying to hold something back and they can it's a totally different person yet but so to The Break-Up stuff the very first time on the very first show I cried on camera and it was like I was super ashamed of it right like I had never been crying like years before that this girl that I was not talking about before she is she had like told me at one point and she was like you're too much of an emotional man because one time I had like teared up a little bit about something yeah I swear it's like when girls like sleep with somebody I really don't like I never do this you're like I never cry and then after that like I just owned it and think went to therapy and stuff and was like really changed my perception. All people knew me for like leaving natural and I like still to this day and so it's hard like living your life and people knowing you because you cried your the crying guy like Derek Derek's cry face yeah it was kind of weird and funny I don't know that's a future thing like I did say I was yeah yeah exactly and so then going back in and dealing with that stuff then I was like I whatever I don't care anymore this is good people should see guys cry I love that I want to ask you about like it said the Demi stuff cuz I feel like people deal with this a lot in real life and we would take some of the things out on the show and real life and if people don't know basically you connect with turn on the show and that you seemed like you were a little more all in cuz she was dating somebody else that was a woman so she's bisexual maybe you should I don't know what she would she would call herself or that's what I'm just going to say so how did that like I feel like a people deal with that in real life a lot where your life I'm all in for this I'm not seeing anybody else but other person is kind of not how do I feel why I think that isn't funny thing was that, and I guess no I didn't not at all and it was that's like a very surprising thing to find out you know because of that at the same time you see this like a bigger picture of it because it's on TV you know the people I can see this is like all of a sudden that's where you kind of take that 30,000 few and it's like oh my God this is going to be a representation for how other people could handle this you know so that was a super extra stressful but I'm just a normal life you can't make people you can tell me what to do now and that's another thing I when I was younger I would have done the whole like a kind of fight for her thing and I don't do that shit anymore now I'm just like you know what if you don't want to go ahead that's fine. Maybe that's giving less I don't know if that's a good or not maybe but at what point in our relationship I think it's early in a relationship is probably pretty healthy I think like to just be like there are seeing somebody else like somebody else more whenever it's not going to work out where do you have to set about like what year was somebody you know so I can work out walking away and like a year-and-a-half and I'd be kind of Pastor somebody didn't want to fight for a little bit but like Drew couple months I don't know let's just call it what it is if you guys don't know if you watch the show you know but if you don't Demi was dating a woman and then they brought her on the show let her stay she was pretty wild like I always think about that and he was like by the way I have this girlfriend now she's going to come here and stay America would lose its shit with the people are more supportive because it was a female female relationship and it was different then I demand to that but it was just kind of wild and so you can turn into this parasympathetic sympathetic character of like oh you're seeing this girl and tell her other person see or do you just to watch them really didn't like it it's a heterogeneous show that it's knowing that that was changing some of that just like I have to I have to let go of this being about me because guess what I like the part about me is like it's not my person so I need to move forward by whatever just to the next person I don't know it's the nicest person on the island as I thought you guys were a good match but I need a lot of people probably a little younger like my may be like for college-age break up with people and then have to be around a person that is real life is like that happens a lot that you have to be around the person and you and you can separate you can still see them on social media and you're so kind of around that you know it's hard to take yourself out of it what do you think about dating multiple people taking back to me cuz I think this is similar to either summer camp or like high school college when you are always around each other cuz it's the same classes or whatever going to things and that's I think when people are dating like multiple people at the same time which is basically with the show different ways yeah I'll be back to talk about how when or how life.

like to fuck a ton of people in the same such a good show is crazy cuz I can't keep up and also people to think that people don't realize what they show it which is Wild is that is it for a 1-month long so what you felt like you've seen these people for days or weeks and it's been hours is like it's really kind of crazy I feel like people forget that has relationship with what a week yeah I think we can half I think ourselves so much and it's a good reminder coming back from it so it's like get the back off of my phone more and like not sit at home and watch Netflix I don't need to smile like a great thing for me or anybody and because I cut all that stuff away and you just like all you have is other people in my belly really ask people whether it's like friendships or intimate whatever in a different way and my phone is buzzing and that's annoying my ADD is acting up trying to go with me if I know exactly vibrate so on their phone I do not me I can't ignore me nuts your phone doesn't vibrate I like that you guys have nothing on this on any of those shows no phones no magazines like that's like to see people like fucking and working out back in the 1300 two options that's all you can do is just like that's why I just literally drapes on top of each other all the time for people who are working out and trying to like peacock in some way to get a lot more like dating around Danny people the same time that I was in high school and I came home buyer like I was at Katy nothing was my high-school boyfriend that we started dating in high school and I came I was like what are you talkin about your 18 cheated on you what who cares that means my parents had to kind of be like she's upset she's really upset I think my mom had this whole view of like weather like dated a bunch of people that's the crazy thing cuz I not meet whoever you can date whoever you can until you find the person you want to stand still with people that end up like married the word dating someone else at the time that they met the person yeah and yet like so I think they like we see it as such a negative thing or such a bad thing but the truth is that come like comes back to what we just talked about before you can't force somebody to be like in something word for feel something like why the hell do we have these negative views on when somebody just like sorry not my person that's that's just how it is instead we go to our friends were like oh my God such a dick you know how to dance like three four people that we can go on 7 days a week and you have Instagram shows a million browsing your DMs everything is John Paul Jones 2000m in the course of an hour when that seemed show dared where he said that I'd that's what I do I want everyone to be like you and everyone is like hey we heard that you had sent DM I got Derek Trucks in cm went in so great funny that's very funny metal slats I'm here for it you know why you want something go get it so I have a question do you think that you have to make the call to like be monogamous or share the information they should you tell somebody that you're dating other people do you tell people that you're dating other people I think this is a huge gray area so that they are I don't know right and I think I have my people who like way you went on a date with somebody else recently I think it's like a it's all about communication as long as you're just talking about that and that's why I like I say there was a surprise it was like well I went on did this with somebody else instead of instead of doing it and like hiding it being straightforward with that and I'm sure that because of that there's some people who I've met who are like so I can't do that that's fine like that's all yeah this is where I am in my stage of what I'm able to like be open with you I'm doing my thing you know do people dislike want to be the only one and it's kind of like with girls feel that way and I like this guy and I really

like I did it all summer or like he sort of asked me to ask you to other people were there and I'm not going to tell you that I'm not either but like if you want to talk about it let's not talk about it then you know people hold on to that too and they're like they want to be exclusive with somebody but they don't want to be the one to say it so that's it that's it that's when the conversation like I guess just if you don't want to have this conversation just use condoms across the board but I hate condoms just kind of like I'm only asking cuz my doesn't know but I don't leave them at all and if we do people get mad when we say that sound like I just bring the worst kind of traits am I complaining clean also would like guys that I was a joke guys okay it's important to have safe sex

Don't worry about it but I didn't have them I was so nervous to go and find finally it was like are like finals test so we know that we're going to have like a virginity at 4 in the afternoon play school's out at one of those music study hall and it's like 5:30 in the morning I go to Walmart I'm going back to my job man in a jogger pant that's right you love them I don't believe these are from Walmart are you flirting with me and my coaches daughter who's there of course oh now it's even what I've known him which I would have I got like 15 things to wrap around the box of gone yet so that it's not not seeing whatever so we got her house start getting busy and she's like you have to be at the condoms yes so I run upstairs yeah good to go you know virginity is broken for both of us great news all around. I can't find the keys to the car and go back upstairs be kind of boxes on the driver's seat my keys are City, that your car door is locked I'm parked in her dad's parking spot ride back to school and had to have has them as beautifully laughing while the last night Virginia had to have the sex talk with it was the most cuz you know like how I wonder why his car is parked here what is associate have his car first thing I would do what and why is he parked in my spot absolutely before still friends to this day her dad and I of course Kiawah Jesus first everybody was I want to talk about reality TV and dating like real in real life like how do you feel like it hurts help him and clearly you're you have more notoriety people you can do you know people DM you in like you just sad and stuff like that but do you feel like there is a stigma don't want to date you or when it anymore do you like him to be careful like I want to talk about all of that it's both actually cuz there's like in personally but the same thing again you guys obviously if I go this all the time because it is a real thing the ones who unlike I want to actually date her other ones who go yeah it's kind of dumb that you did that you know like that the day that I met you liquid a year ago the three of us at a party and I like saw you across the room I was like oh he's so cute and my friend is like he was on The Bachelor and I was like oh I'm not interested in that you really talking and I was I had such a good time talking it was so much fun and I was like so he's just like a normal Charming guy but I feel like I don't know I don't know if people really think it's great or down my initial knee-jerk was I would never date somebody that was on reality TV for a couple reasons I was like what's wrong with somebody wants to do that for sure so I would love for you to talk about the pizza Gods exactly it really it's not it's it's good in the sense like that's what you want to do and I was actually what the whole argument that you sound like come up just like if that's what you want to do if you want anyone girls that sign your DM you want to hook up with him go ahead to that's up to you like I'm not here to tell you what to do yeah cuz you know that we were asking a question like how to grow how did your dad's can you do it again you can do whatever you want. Yeah that's up to you but it's like if somebody for a longer then you know a week it's nuggets it's harder because then you don't know who to trust I think and that's like the biggest problem from a dating perspective is like I don't trust people to actually do what you did by the way which is just like oh no he's like I got to know him and now I know him I think they did too much guys weren't super together by the way so Joey keep touching a leg so you prefer somebody to be more like yeah I'm not into it but then gets to know you and that other person exactly like right now should I do definitely prefer somebody who like slide into my care too much that's really what it would matter think money things like they don't care so much is just it's just like it's somebody else to them I don't know I don't have them feel like I feel like you and you meet a guy I was sure cuz you mean you guys honestly it have a super huge platform to and I think it and like it would immediately granted immediately turned it turns me off a little bit but then it's like am I being hypocritical like I put my whole life out there to it's just on a different format no I meant for you and I know how you feel but every day but like if a guy approaches you specific and like if you're on his first date with a guy do you want a guy and I love it things that really feels the same way it's like you have a different level of spice even use the word game for us but you know your aunt eBay we have this podcast but we still following and you know we still people know who we are and that's my biggest fear that someone just wants to like fuck me so we can stay there so of course that's not even supposed to expose I'll be your Walmart Emily Blunt and do you want okay so what kind of girls are like the looks looks aren't that important to me I mean it's just like obviously attraction matters so I don't I don't have like at specific thing I should say that wise is like something like guys that are your nice guy and the almond shape or whatever the people say it's usually a thing for eyelashes are natural to extensions extensions done Unwell by Gastly weak he asked me if I could be a serial killer and I pause and he was like wait why are you not tell what's the pay like a big personality and I want to be mad like equal there yeah I've been in that like somebody will call me out for things if I have I driven you need to disagree because I just want them to have their own opinions which is such a weird thing but a lot of women are taught that like they shouldn't do that so I don't feel like I don't know cuz I'm not as I love you said that but there's plenty of guys that just want a submissive not opinionated oh there's talk of the ton of guys want their money and I think there's a lot of guys that say they want somebody that's opinionated and they get it and they're like little I don't want this and then you're like a 13 I love the way I want it is someone who's not an asshole about it I'm a hundred percent right but somebody who likes set speaks their mind but then also listens to you that's huge many people that do that you guys probably do that because you're also like doing this this is exactly what you do a day to hang out too by the way God yeah, I hate that guy play John Paul Jones you on read it somewhere in their own will actually you get kind of political on Instagram which I like because I feel I want to say that Bachelor Nation could be a little right-leaning just I feel like what the what we see the people that they pack her seem like they had cater to that type of viewership and I like that you are not look so outspoken but you stand up for what you believe in and I do you feel like or do you want a person gets more I think I think like the big thing with whether or not you talk about how you feel politically from a lot of like different reality stars are like anybody who's been in the public eye they don't want blowback like they're afraid of that they did they decide they need more fans they want to have more fans and that's because that's maybe like they're only thing they do so I think because of the fact that I have my own separate thing that I do my normal 95 boring job I don't care so much about how many fans do I have I can set aside for me this is a representation of who I have time to clean a man if I think he's stuff and I would talk to my friends about this stuff then I'm also going to put it out there in the same way you know and so like I don't have any fear at all like it's laughable some of the opinions of people have and I think like highlighting how laughable that is sometimes is important to see how stupid some of the people send me a reply to my like political thoughts or I don't know just like I feel like that's just life to politics is not just politics politics is also just voice and you don't use it to Santa for you believe in your voicemails not the only guy I would have talked about a lot of people think me or thank us I mean I'm really outspoken about my beliefs on social media people say thank you I'm like 4 literally wiped like they don't expect it which an offer me it should be the norm it's like it's why are you why are you not using your voice why did you build this brand for what just so sure to please everybody like I did I think you're always going to get ahead by speaking up for what you believe in and I'm not not like a pic of sideway but just for what you think is right like what is there anything your passion about that keeps you up at night like why do you not we didn't know, doesn't say like want to listen to email sounded so you're showing me where you're going to let your loose sounds listen to look at time like you don't have to do this and you want to listen or show but we're not going to not talk about women's rights woman's body is want to talk just cuz if you don't like it that's why I'm so here's my phone it's like back to what I said you can disagree with somebody but still listen to their opinion I have I have people who think very differently than me who are really close friends but we both can openly talk about it and then be like that and it be like it is not even the journal. They're really talked about this we want to do a whole episode on and I'm curious to hear what you think what do you think about like girls doing the thirst traps and stuff on Instagram like is there a line do you find do you feel like guys are like I like to see what she's doing or they're like Dom and they're like no that's hot there's a line because there's definitely thought about that but I seen him like let's talk about this with you I wanted to see if something is not for me I think girls like you see here girl say over and over and over like I don't want a guy with no guys with selfies and it's all them like making duck faces and sits like a portrait mode photo and it is so okay barber shop to talk about and crafts for girls Okay I want to say know that I don't like them but I constantly find myself just being like okay let's go through I'm looking like not liking oh I talk with Ross recently about this by the way of profit I broke his dick over a year ago what are the first four first guess when you guys are friends so I'm glad that later okay mad years of having sex with you can I just don't know that I can imagine it as I wish you could see his right now at 82nd episode I've never seen rain is so like I think I can't make Derek uncomfortable maybe that's what it is like I look at him and he's like you can't get to me he really didn't you yeah it's really hard for me okay so are you dating thirst trap girl okay yeah I think I like the tough thing with that is I don't know why you have to not care and and and be like very confident in the fact that they're not all so you know like doing that because of the fact that they're trying to find new guys that that's just like the way that they get likes never worked out because of the fact that they have their so focus on like their phone and Detachment they're getting from there so I think that's like the the negative thing about it yeah I'll tell you whatever. And I like I want I would judge that seem like the kind of guy I like and self-deprecating about it and I think you seem like you'd be the kind of guy like that likes LOL let go into a dressing room if I'm feeling like thin and I like the lighting and I'll be like they're having a half off sale today and it's just like a drive like I'd like to at least poke fun at it like we all know what we're doing all right to see my daddy how do you say hi. Right like I'm a little anxious to see it if I'm going to give a funny caption so exactly it's like the ones that are that's too much is you haven't had while I didn't actually realize it until just now that's the ones that I have liked been I have been unable to see what's going on here where they're like they have a quote by someone famous it's not at all related to what they're doing because it's like a selfie like a sexy duck face selfie it's like everybody get out and vote today and they're dead serious the duck face selfie I like it was terrible person as I can stand post something like that and not get roasted by everybody in my life and like that's what I like about my friends I posted something in like a few weeks ago I'm cuz I'm a star strapping somebody apartment look a little crop top and a pair of like boy shorts and I was just like work attire like 9 a.m. thirst trap and my girlfriend and she was like vagina lights at 9 a.m. Tuesday that's got two people I want in my life that's what I've always liked it after all the attention I am still the same person because of my friends like your friend keep you grounded family member that mean that she likes a girl out here at like what are your friends like that nobody is making fun of you because like I chose I agree I was like the ironic that I oppose people making fun of me for the ironic shit like I posted all the text messages after that getting made fun of shirt so it like I don't know make your first have Sunny are girls I don't know me but not everybody is funny and this is probably a little too controversial because I kids people who probably need a little bit of support attention it's when they ask for that when they they will write like a hole nine paragraphs long without like I feel like it's been such things this happen this happen I'm struggling a little bit lately so I'm just going to post this because I think I look sexy in this one and I'm just I just I see that and my brain just goes why are you posting on Instagram to get the positive that that's not that's don't do that that's the worst positive reinforcement of the worst spell attention and then and that's where it all starts that's how every Instagram thought was B was born say what it is that you did get flooded with comments I hope you're okay what's going on here like he'll come home for a few days her tragedy and like maybe someone I dated and it was like the most Timothy thirst trap it was like she's like it's been really rough but we swing made it through or something like that but at the same time as it is like a selfie that's them looking whatever you know that I don't know if that person which is I need to know who anybody is doing but I'm also like I just hope you figure it out I hope you like find other ways to deal with this and Instagram likes cuz it's not real no post that on Instagram if you looking for some help by Derek how to release and you like this since you just said like you can't get to me but I'm also a sensitive guy like I am a sensitive Guy where do we start the rose so glad you brought up the bracelets cuz I've been like where's the window to bring up the brave emotional side wear bracelets leather bracelet and his hand like blows up friends Ross in all that leather spiritual life coach for people so so so I don't know what those are the intro and she gave me a stone to put under my bed for a sexual prosperity in this new apartment you can check it out later back to your mom because of that I've always been a talker so I'm the one if there's anything that happens in a relationship that because of I think she and I would would talk whenever like through any issues or anything that I was like going through in the kid my mom so it's like in a relationship that I have an issue with some with like the person I'm with you know some people get mad and then I have to go for a walk or something and then they come back and they're they're fine like it's all gone I have to like talk to you so I don't let it I can't let it go to find a good spot right not to like find her standing or whatever and I don't know shut up some people but that's any why like I also that's what therapy it's just made sense for me at that point to I realize that my reaction to something in the moment is actually not how I'm going to feel in 25 thing that everybody but it's not how I'm going to feel in 24 hours so I can you like to try to take a beat and separate cuz like I know what you're going to get for me Med one is like anger and in a few hours or a day you're going to get like compassion and understanding so I do person need some space will do you say I only know it from Reading Chelsea Handler most recent book life will be the death of me highly recommended but I just know what I am cuz I'm the same as her and it's like it's based on what your initial reaction is in the face with conflict or something like that and it's like anger fear or sadness I think and I'm anger Beyond so I can track them and it's not good I got to take the walk I've got to take a few breaths like I get angry what are you saying you work on therapy myself because of that that's why I was like naturally drawn to speak to somebody to ya is literally like with a lot of the stigma I love talking about myself why do you think I got to podcasts you at we're wonderful on the show cuz at least what we saw in you if you had somebody coming at you really aggressively and they were also unwilling to talk which was to watch you diffuse that with this crazy person that was just in your face but also not willing to talk was very crazy I've never really seen someone act that while I was the first time I've ever been in the Intensive just think that it would be rash bass is obviously too amped up for television a little bit on his end. Like maybe it's just like that I think you just like that again he just snapped and the way the show works as soon as you are a little bit he said he was like tired and anxious but I don't know me when I drink a whole bunch and that you're like you or your kind of a different version of yourself to put people and I should probably do it like hangover anxiety in their heat exhausted and then like the cameras on your face with a little bit of them comfortable being in like a different in different state when you do talk about relationship stuff and therapy obviously what do you feel like your biggest issue that you feel like you need to work through when it comes to relationships like we all have our own our thing that's totally like my thing is I go I waver between like just being like fuck it I'm entrusting too much and then be like nope not trusting anybody just like back and forth and I don't know if I haven't been able to find like that. Comfortable to write a good looking girl the things but likes guys really really proud of me so excited and like so excited to tell people what I do but not necessarily somebody that's hard to find that bad like I want to be a fan of me cuz they're proud of me and not a fan like a fangirl yes you know have you dated someone since you started the Bachelor or Bachelorette I guess that it was not part of the whole thing like if you have a relationship with like a Beyond a couple why did a girl who I like it actually went to college with I'd like when does whole other I was like all this is somebody I know so I can trust them well yeah that was a whole thing she then cheated on me later so I am so I couldn't trust her either and then but it's always been again like somebody who is basically like yeah that shows down you should have done that and then you know for me and I can get perfect you don't care but the difference is exactly what you said usually that has broken down to where they're like a shame to tell people or shame that people come up to me and talk to me about it and to me now I'm like okay wait a minute because that's who I this is part of who I am not be ashamed of gas that's bullshit like that's not okay right now you're not like I don't understand why you're comfortable dating me because if you can if you can be a like a proud of all of me we're supportive of all of me then this should be the only thing that we do in the first place if someone just did something that I did I would like I would know what you're not going to change your life to me like somebody is public as you is my is my worst nightmare that's what he said to me and I was like so devastated by it I like walked out of the bar Eyes Crying in the street but if I'm your worst nightmare was going to be a but I'm not going to change my whole career and my life and my friendship structure and my best friend of my business because of one person what's like the perfect picture that we paying like what's the white picket fence picture and how stupid that is how bullshit that is that and that that like if people can't just accept others for who they are you know maybe this person wants to not make much money and they choose to the bike you know be a social worker whatever it might. Sit like if that if that's your barrier Ono like that's that's why I'm ashamed of the fact that they are not making whatever like six figures a year that's that's something that you can really easily look at me like well that's really shity that they would feel that way about that person write any different than what you're talking about right now it's actually literally the same exact same thing it's not yet but we're going to ask you about staying at smart looking through stuff with him but we did post on her Instagram story what people will have questions they had for you so we are going to answer a guy actually Nation questions settings to private you'll tell us no spoiler by so yeah do the room so I have I just want to live the first question you and then she can you all the questions I was talking to Derek talking about the I have a girlfriend I wanted actual years ago and my first question for her was what a lot of people ask is when you're not like on a date or filming at what do you do all day I mean on The Bachelorette we had a bunch of people brought guitars wanted to be a professional musician anyone has kicked off a career yet from doing that so I don't know why people keep thinking they can are there it's a wrap. They're doing black and white wait to tell you I I didn't I didn't masterbate to this but I probably could have got like slow dancing in a burning room is one of my favorite song got into it you did John Mayer slow dancing in a burning room for this this is how to love that song every relationship is always a burning room has everyone follow you can watch him sing into a microphone with his guitar for our like oh that's there's a bunch of articles about that now back but just cuz I think they want people to not they don't want they don't think that's what the shows about how stupid they like wanted to still be about like the relationships and stuff so you know just try whatever it's doing this for 12 minutes a day all day everyday but not too much truth here on this road is to to drive our all right let's go through this I guess we'll do we have done if you can't answer I just go as far as he obviously I want to know this too would you be the bachelor I think what it comes down to that question you know people there's there's a lot of back and forth on this actually I'm a rainbow on this one thing I know their things come back to like people being afraid of someone seeing who they fully are on like in public and trying to do the thing that they're supposed to do and that's a PR thing going back for years and years and years of questions so I don't know it's like a really big responsibility and like it's the lead on a TV show right it's not you're not becoming president of the United States like that's not I said the same thing called a launching point to take as long as you know who you are and you don't think that that would like change from being in like on the show if if people are like not sure of themselves don't do it but I'd bury much think I know who I am like why would I worry about that changing me in some way that's a super cool thing I can always go back and be a banker at any time so I think it's I think it's ridiculous how much people downplay that and then maybe it's me it's more about them trying to put like it a certain image out for themselves and again that's stupid like we've had enough of that people need to stop doing this stuff I'll answer that way I I just think people I mean don't get me started the whole like black bachelor have a lot of thoughts but I mean people overwhelmingly a word I think like I saw a lot of you kind of late in the game and then just so much Mike Mike for the most part yeah on Demi Lovato's its arrival status with showing her body on edited and her cellular cellular it was the hashtag it was really great and Mike what's my timer actually Russia people are dating but Tyler sees like allegedly dating Gigi major major sad are you guys are really cute celebrities today it's so it's so well I think Wells broke that barrier Wells walks okay I have a question I think this is funny how much sex actually happens during Bachelor in Paradise I think originally like that what I didn't do it the first time around like after The Bachelorette cuz people like I would has a bad rap it's just like them having sex on the beach the whole time I'm selling it now I'm in therapy number bracelets if you can't take a joke ask me out just try it but there's booms and by the way where they have the AC in them so that's where you get to masturbating is beads of sweat June said some very quickly some areas right no there's no way that's one of the things they just don't have but that's a whole thing in a lot of like Central America open concept wish you'd I run my AC basically Around the Clock I love my mom and I told her well excuse me do it. But he's not anymore I just heard that but somebody trainer oh yeah obviously sorry I was thinking about the gas while we're talking about hot dogs I have to say this tweet this is my favorite tweets about when people are really on Twitter like Dare for The Bachelor and it was two screenshots Derek of your followers on Instagram and she tweeted can we talk about how Derek recently followed 20 + dog accounts in a row this is the kind of Bachelor energy we needed our Plies and also someone please check on him Sunshine with my therapist Dogwood mirror like you need to get bracelets first of all because I thirst trap conversation I just got so tired of seeing the same shit all the time on my feet and it was like all people looking for attention and like I mean of course it says people with dogs who are looking for their dogs get attention but I mean they're not as many accounts as you can. All of them on your Instagram feed and your you will follow Zendejas probably typed in like started to type the word Corgi and like they saw at least act like that to be so few Corgi has not. So now just in general like just jpj like is he like that was it okay to Blackwell how scripted is it were like when stuff like that this is a unscripted show that's like what reality TV is technically called right is an unscripted yeah this is an unscripted show we are just living our lives there is zero guidance on that they are not like oh you know like when you try that again can you send a picture in a different way know that we are not actors I freaking work at a bank like I'm not side and actor who can cry on command in front of a camera you know like that's not mine Audrina talking but they'll be filming Heidi it's because it's all voice overs cuz there was can you resay that in a different way here in a different tone it's not like I'm talking to you it feels different than the bachelor I will. Iconoclast Senior Life.
