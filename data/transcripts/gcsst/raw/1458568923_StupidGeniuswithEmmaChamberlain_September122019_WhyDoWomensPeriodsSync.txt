And I like to vent about them to you guys so we talked about. Quite a bit on this on this phone past so I felt like this was very fitting in the last episode I told the story if you didn't hear it about how II dropped my tampon applicator in the Louis Vuitton store it was used it was in the plastic but that doesn't make it any better cuz it was kind of coming out of the plastic I don't want to talk about it was a lot so I have experience synced periods all of my friends are pretty much Saint I mean I literally have two friends in my life to Olivia and Amanda my bitches okay and I'm with those motherfukers I'll act so like it makes sense that were like pretty much always saying I mean recently depending on like if you know one of us is taking a medication orally one of us is like you know doing like if there's changes in our lives that would affect our. Back in someone's make his unsync which has happened recently kind of cuz I magic acne medicine then later and maybe. Not make sense at all like it literally did when I don't even know it's not normal like I don't I just like it'll random I'll get my. Like one day like and then like it'll go away for like 3 weeks and then I'll get like that doesn't make sense I got to really know what's going on because they like phones up your hormones but it's for my acne and guess what cause breaking out worse than ever me so like what the fuc anyway so but I am pretty much things with my friends at this point we're all like a few days off so I really want to know how that works like his I thought it was I was I was a myth is it a bit okay it's controversial I believe in it cuz I've seen it happen and made it happen I think it happened with my mom I think we were synced at one point we live together and like I don't really think that's really a myth because I've been there it's like you don't think they like what you had a paranormal experience you best believe you're believing in that shit you know I think that about. Syncing cuz I fucking the lived it and guess what when is women women's multiple women's when multiple women are on their periods together it is so bad it is so bad it is dangerous my God are you playing with fire I mean to women on their. Is equivalent to like what's 2 things that like explode like really explosively like gunpowder and like I don't even know about I don't know how that works so I don't know how that explodes like Fire And Gasoline that is two women on their periods okay you're arguing you're crying you hate everyone but then you kind of hate each other because you're both on your. And like you're both have attitude so than that combined is just a fucking mess and like thinking. Shouldn't have and I wish it didn't because like it's so much easier when ones on there. The other is isn't so that you can leg lift each other up at your times of need. You're just fucking ripping each other apart with your class that is it so before we get into our guesses as to how. Sink or why or if he even they do let's get into the word of the day so stupid genius word of the day is menstration menstration is another term for a woman's. It's a combination of Latin and Greek words meaning Moon and months okay well you know as a man I do not have it. But I wish I had something else like but I have to I don't know a semicolon up to your Gadget language joke hahaha Delta arrest me for that saying I'm hungry bye-bye I love that word okay so menstration I think the word menstration is hilarious and I like to use it what am I trying to make something uncomfortable I'll be like I'm sorry I menstruate right now and I can't I can't come cuz I'm menstruating is that even a word b i mean I'd really like you to being like well I'm on my way I'm going through my menstration I like to make it sound really like professional and serious I think it's funny for me no one laughs it's not a funny joke for anyone else again just ready for me for my own Amusement I don't expect anybody else to laugh or get it my menstration my use of the word menstruation is like it's at it it's at its own level of humor that I don't expect everybody to be tapping into quite yet some whatever but I'm already like my brains are doesn't make yours already moving like I'm starting to like think about this and I like him really really was just wanting to get into it so let's do it guess number one why do women's periods sync thank you doordash for sponsoring this episode of stupid genius I am so excited I am a huge doordash fan okay food delivery service from an app is basically the best thing dare I say it since sliced bread okay it's so genius like you know those days when you just overdid it like you just you worked too hard you are too long like you don't have any energy left your you barely have any emotions left like you just kind of overwork yourself you know those days and the last thing I want to do is cook on those days that is when doordash comes to the rescue because you can order literally anything you want off of doordash for dinner for lunch or breakfast whatever and it just saves a lot of time and energy for those days when you just don't have time or energy doordash connect you to your favorite restaurants in your city so that you can literally get whatever you want when you're having one of those rough days and you need to just get something that you know you like you know doordash has a lot of options ordering is also super easy all you have to do is just open the app to do you want to eat in your food will be delivered to you they're over 340,000 restaurants in 3,300 cities so you might even find a new favorite that's one of my favorite things to do is use order from a random place on doordash that I've never tried before and see if I like it's a great way to find new good restaurants yeah doordash is overall win-win situation right now are lizards can get $5 off their first order of $15 or more when you download the doordash app and answer promo code stupid genius that's $5 off your order when you download the doordash app from the App Store and enter promo code stupid genius okay last time don't forget that's promo code stupid genius for $5 off your first order from doordash thank you doordash and you guys go check it out all right peace and love you all k baby periods have something to do with the Moon this is a really really I'm reaching but the word menstration has the word moon in it so maybe the moon has something to do with you're. Like waves in like currents okay so think about it if you and your friend are with you and this other women are with each other a lot hello I don't know what the fuk just happened with glass things are getting loud over here anyway if you and your like whatever woman your roundabout that you're sinking with if you guys are together a lot that means that you the Moon where it's placed in comparison to you on Earth is the same a lot and you know how I like when the moon we're depending on where the Moon is that affects the currents and stuff like that because if it's pull right so maybe the moon if you're close to the Moon with your buddy you guys both are getting your blood sucked out of you at the same time by Gravity by the moon's pole it's pulling the blood out it's pulling the egg out and it's at the same Force because you're equidistant you and your friend to the Moon because you're next to each other that make any fucking sense at all UCLA mean the fuck me I knew that was wrong cuz like I don't think that the moon actually I mean I I was thinking maybe the moon could have something to do with. But that gas would have a lot of complications because everybody in the same town would probably have the same menstrual cycle in that case and that's not the case at all so and even people that you're friends with someone in front of the same. As you and you're so good guess that would make me sound smart but it was incorrect so as long as it sounds kind of intellectual that I'm doing then that's all I need I just want you know what I mean I just want to sound good is that conceited anyways moving on getting over to the female hormone is called pheromones right okay so what if you're around somebody a lot is astragin what's pheromones the smell oh okay okay so so like so they're not pheromone sorry wrong more estrogen I think that there is maybe maybe women give off certain maybe it is pheromones the term has more sexual huh yeah so then maybe that your estrogen is like up it's up during your. Is that true it dips this is so interesting I'm stumped okay got it so maybe like it's almost like contagious like maybe women being around each other when when is on there. And the other isn't it might make the woman who isn't having her. Because she's getting exposure to these what does it mean when a man is estrogen estrogen hormone because they're being exposed to this hormone it might make them start their. Sooner than they normally would write because they were exposed to that level of like estrogen or that like hormone whatever because they were around it so then they might get there. Like maybe a week sooner and then the next month when that woman is on her. Again and you're still really close with this other woman then you get your. A little bit closer to this woman and then the next month you're a little closer Dixie know y'all motherfuckers synced and y'all fighting and shit how is that guess but it's a good test today but they all stupid a little bit now that was like my genuine guess going into this I wanted to start out with one that I didn't really think was accurate cuz I was like I still want to put it out there but I don't know if it's right that what I saw was completely right so now I'm just upset this is stop meow because like my big question mark is around how how does one body know that another body is going through. Like how would you know that how the body know that in order to want to sync maybe it's something that has to do with like Evolution more you know in the way that we were evolved having to do with mates and Recreation in general procreation not Recreation that awkward moment when you recreate procreation cell my thought is that a woman but a woman's body can sense when another woman is on there. And it's kind of a competitive thing in a way because if you're on your. William Howard. Link effect oh maybe you sync if your trying to find a mate because don't you let off more pheromones when you're on your. When you're ovulating so that's what you need to only going tender when your ovulating cuz you giving up that energy with him I don't believe in pheromones because I've had periods a lot so during off okay okay I'm a Sunday there between number one it's like a competition between women about like who's having their. In order to somehow acquire a Mayweather that's who like pheromones or something like that so it's like the human bodies are subconsciously competitive and that way and so they want to have their. At the same time to see who wins while at their peak of pheromones either that or girl just like love going through it together like girls like to go to the bathroom together and they like the other. Together is like Squad Squad has to like bleed at the same time okay how was I okay I was close what's the right answer y'all answer to why do women's periods sync up when women lived together or are in close proximity to each other very often there. Stand to sync Apple watch to be such as somewhat controversial but it's believed to happen because of something called socially mediated synchrony its purpose is that groups of females become sexually receptive oil to gas up meaning say about be singled out and therefore targeted by men basically it's a protective feature put in place by Mama nature to make sure if women don't get treated as off Jack's by the opposite sex shots because that's the only one on there. That's right no shame in here we are all in this together smart. What sync up with my lady friends. Also I wish I had a. I'm Professor fuel aboard and that was a stupid Genius answer of the day oh my God wait what that so basically what you're saying is if you and your bestie are fighting over Jonathan at the club I don't know anything about clapsaddle really know much about that but like let's say you and bestie are fighting over Jonathan at the club you're on your. Your friend is not what Mother Nature is trying to say is that this man is going to choose the girl that's not on her. So that he can avoid about avoid a bloody situation. It okay yeah that's so interesting that is so fucking weird like that's like almost that seems like a conscious thing which is weird to me like that's not like okay but that's kind of sad like that's almost sad that like it has to be a fight over like that a woman is an object in that way where it's like if they're on there it's like you know basically looking at you and your friend as the same the only difference between you two is that one is there. I don't think guys I like to give the benefit of the doubt those two guys and believe that they don't think of women like that I do like to give the benefit of that I don't like to pin man as evil as often like it when it comes to that although I mean anybody can be fucked up a little bit in the head depending on who they are I do like to assume and hope that most guys aren't like that although I have who hasn't been proved wrong high school was a time you know what I mean yeah yeah that looks sadly make sense but I also think that like if your on your. You can just hold hands for the week shut up just fucking hold hands for the week or maybe you should go on vacation make it work but like I always wonder like what guys genuinely them. Thanks I think it depends on the guy to like Broly some guys are like I don't care about blood probably pretty rare maybe I don't know I don't know but then I'd like some guys are really grossed out by I don't know I don't know if like that's gross it might be maybe to some guys all of the boys listen to this coming down below rate. Blood on growth scale out of 10 I only care about is gross person play just like like even if it's like someone else like I just don't care like it's like a part of fucking being a human being is part of being a woman I also appreciate my. So much because I thought I was never going to get it cuz I got 16 and so everybody else out there. Before me and I didn't and I was like they'll really like an outsider and then I got it I really appreciated the fact that I was going to be able to procreate recreate later in life so I was really grateful when I got my. Surprisingly because it meant that I was going to be able to have children and I thought I was infertile so that was like really scary for me but I got it and it's like an all-time rage recently has been really raging on me recently so like apparently be careful what you wish for ladies because I was like somebody left a look at one of right now though I shouldn't have been like that because I could have definitely got a few more years without it and Ben Craigslist but that's enough. Dog for the day everybody's play projectile vomiting at this point although I think that the the quote-unquote grow stigma around. Guys and gals get over it grow up grow up it's blood although I do get us something off like a phobia of blood imagine being a woman and dating a guy with a phobia of blood that would be tough especially yeah that would be an interesting or even a girl who has a football no cuz girls they have their periods so they're used to it okay where is guy's only way I would you just you really have to go on vacation for the week anyway that's it for that last episode I said I was going to talk about during the wind out of this episode my my hygiene rumors so I guess what happened was a long time ago on Snapchat I made a joke complete joke cuz I was in the car with my mom we're driving somewhere and I was bored so I like set up my Snapchat camera and I was joking with my mom in the car about how is like she forced me to shower but how it's like up to me but I don't have to shower if I don't want a mom like just acting like a you know bratty like 12 year old against Lily's what I was doing was joking around everybody thought it was a joke and they're like oh my God a man doesn't shower for 3 Days that's disgusting and I was like guys like I didn't say that it was a joke I never said it was a joke cuz I just assumed that my tone was like obvious parent Lee I was wrong and everybody thought whatever cuz when I was like younger when I was like ten I was kind of a tomboy in a little a little bit and I didn't I hated showering when I was younger now I love showering I look forward to it having clean hair like smelling good like it feels good to me like I enjoy that as as I should so you know I was kidding but I was kind of joking around my mom by like I didn't you know I would like kind of reminding her of what I was like when I was like ten I'm sorry but if your 10 years old me like showering you're a living you should have oily hair once a week when your 10 you just should I dye my hair and my parents are divorced look at my dad's house there was no way he did not give a fuck if I showered also was prepubescent I didn't smell bad you know what I mean I was literally like and I was like I was going a long time without showering but I definitely got more time than I should have because I was fucking 10 years old I didn't know any better and my dad was at my dad's house and I was like yeah you don't have to shower I don't care you don't mean I was like who's fun but I'm sorry I was just kind of like joking about that my mom everybody took it seriously and now the whole internet apparently thinks that I have bad hygiene which is you know what I don't hate being hated for that because it's false so like also that's not a valid reason to not like someone so I kind of just like let it exist cuz I might get away this isn't harming me it's not true it's kind of funny at times and when I like you know I have a sponsorship with a company that has to do with hygiene I get to make a funny joke about it so like it seems like a good deal to me I'm not going to and I'll let it happen I do get defensive though sometimes like every time I get in the shower I stare at it for a second then like I could Snapchat this just so everyone knows but I don't care enough maybe I'm just trying to make myself seem like I don't care enough that's a question I'm asking myself I love you Snapchat I also have a phobia of taking a photo of the shower head in the reflection of me naked so I do have a big collection Member One Time like when the whole a shower thing started becoming like me and everybody was Roseanne me about it on Twitter I wanted to Snapchat this is bad I like took a photo as batting in the shower but as naked sorry don't picture it just think about it scientifically here came and took a photo of my chakra and yeah it was and then I didn't I saw it before I arrived and easily saw it before I would but the thought the thought of Meatballs Italian what even the fact that I knew I saw I was really aware that you would like to see the reflection of me in the fucking shower head but the mere thought that I even considered posting a photo of the thing with maybe if I was a little bit Swayze I was mortified I was literally mortified like for like 5 minutes you know in like you get like so close like it was like it was like you get so close to something that would have been so embarrassing that you almost feel more embarrassed that it almost happened that's how I felt about that that's almost how I felt about my tampon applicator falling out of my bag today at the store that you told us were last episode like not a lot of people noticed and I was really Sly about it so I feel like it was I handled it with Grace but like if I would have been talking to somebody and it would have happened like the thought of it makes me unbelievably upset so yeah that's that that's my shower lipo now I want to talk about speaking of showering and in the lack thereof and not showering let's talk about my trip to Hawaii where I I literally I feel like what about a Beach vacation I recently went to Hawaii was grade me and my two best friends went and and it was amazing I swim in the ocean I swim in the pool I use the outdoor shower but the funny thing was that I feel like this is the one thing that I almost felt guilty about on this trip cuz I was like maybe the rumors about me are true maybe my hygiene is terrible I would go in the ocean and then I would rinse off an outdoor shower so I get all the salt off me but then I wouldn't shower for the rest of the day and then it goes ocean again and then she'll like I was getting in the ocean and then getting out and then getting an ocean and getting out like 6 times a day and I wasn't like taking a full body shower in between each time I was just showing off now door shower barely getting the salt out of my asshole and like it was so packed in there like the whole day and like that did make me feel a little bit gross but then it's like what's the point of me showering in between my beach sessions because quite frankly I'm going to be getting fucking salty again so what's the point you know what I mean so I did feel guilty about that but I mean I would shower then to the day so like what's the issue but I felt guilty because you made me feel bad about not showering after everything I do you did that so anyway yeah but why was amazing I just want to talk about it because he was just so great let me tell some of the highlights so number one best sushi I've ever eaten in my life at this hotel we stayed at the andaz or andaz and now if you want to check it out and stay there cuz it's a great hotel and absolutely recommend the food was the highlight I was fully bloated and had a food baby the entire trip cuz I just couldn't stop bugging eating the food was too good the sushi for dinner that we have every night was fucking unbelievable how to get a cucumber avocado roll you would say go there's no way that that's good Next Level next fucking lab I literally was like we got it every night my friends and I we all even my friend who is not vegetarian was eating these cucumber avocado rolls because they were so fucking good we got corn on the cob like to see was like this Japanese corn on the cob unbelievable the fried rice so unique the fucking miso soup so unique the fucking the corn on the cob was killer I don't even know it wasn't it kind of it was like they did a little twist on like Mexican street corn and kind of did it in their own Japanese twist fucking insanely good so that was oh my God chase that shit my mouth is like watery I need to like eat after this session not even because I'm hungry but because I literally like in a talk about food for the next five minutes and I just like it was so good like a food okay what's crazy to me is hell like good food can be so impactful like it's crazy that something that you literally just in the consume for fuel can like actually be so emotional it can be fucking like you know it can be it can make put you in a good mood it can like you're creating memories like my only memory of my trip is me and my friends getting food and coffee like once every 20 minutes so like the foods that I like her by to make you jealous but I won't go into detail like you did by the sushi. Just deserve it breakfast buffet unbelievable fresh fruit I'd get oatmeal like the full nine yards avocado toast whatever funny crazy good so fresh so good and amazing then we went to make an acai bowls from this cute little fucking organic shop that was by some rocks and we're jumping off of so cute not to mention banana bread moist as fuck never have had moisture banana bread there's something in their water there's something in the water that makes her food more moist in Hawaii like the the sticky like the sushi rice that texture I never I never experienced Something Beautiful the fucking banana bread could literally shave my head I would think it I love that banana bread the banana bread we got it from the soil organic place like little grocery store I'm literally can bus leaving you out this banana bread it was so fucking Moises so good and fuck you if you don't like the word moist that is a right correct word to describe the span of right and I don't care then in Ausable was great to all that there's so many I'll say both in La that I feel like I just went like I'm so unaffected by an acai Bowl I just eat it and I'm like yeah just like fucking sleep every other place on Melrose but I mean this place was really good and they had like whipped honey on top come on bitch that's so good and then cuz I don't lie we going to just eat the same oh my God no the last thing they had a charred Caesar salad which like so they would Grill the Caesar salad it was like a full Romaine Leaf like clump of romaine leaves that was roasted but somehow still Christian C H the flavor the fucking the complexity it was amazing that was so good also the smoothies that they made for when you're like sitting by the pool or whatever I mean it can you tell that I needed this like I needed it so bad like I'm literally talking about the most random should the only thing that happened to me on the trip it was like a problem number one I was having my menstruation like I was being a little bit psychotic about things that I should have been like why was I like there's like I just was like overthinking my entire existence like while trying to enjoy my trip to my friends were like listening to music tanning relaxing and I'm like fucking trying to tan and I'm just like thinking about like everything is ever happened to me and everything that's going to happen to me and also howl like it was like that. So we made it work and nobody knew actually I compared to like I kept it in poker face so it was fine but the other thing is I posted so many times on Instagram I think Instagram wanted to remove my account like I wouldn't be by there like we want to remove her like she's just too much she's annoying everybody I post like twice a day which is like not normally what I like to do but I did and I do know it's because in a lot of people were talking they're like on Twitter either you know I'm I'm creeping on you all and eyes of yours and just take photos yes no I like to take photos while I'm living so there's a lot of opportunities like if I see it if there's good lighting if it's fucking golden hour bitch I'm outside if I'm on my way walking to dinner and I'm wearing cute rabbit and it takes two minutes to like take fucking a hundred photos cuz you know we always burst in this family okay but like I'm going to do it it was such as I was getting slightly roasted but I was like you know why this is so worth it because I'm having fun and weirdly I love from me when I'm on vacation I like being able to like can you just wear stuff that I think is cute like we're like you don't try a little bit harder when they have it's not really that much harder but it's like the time when I get to wear pieces that I don't normally get to wear like you know I was writing these cool like kind of retro like sailor type of shorts that were kind of like Bermuda blank which is kind of ugly but like I was making a trying to make it work I was trying to make it happen but I would wear those in LA on a day-to-day basis but they made so much sense in the in the environment so it was just fun for me to experiment with that while I was in the midst of eating sushi so it's like I'm just like wearing fun clothes and I'm eating sushi that I'm going to like a perfect but now I'm home and I'm back to my life and I did miss Evelyn my kitty and he's just been like extra loving ever since I got back in and he misses Mommy it's whatever but why it was great I'm trying to think I'd another story about it I want to tell before I wrap this up that is me slapping my head you couldn't tell o so basically my friends and I love to just go bask in the ocean you know where it would be like can spend hours in the ocean together cuz we have fun we like body serve we like just going to swim around we rented paddle boards at one point we snorkeled a little bit saw the scariest walking fish I've ever seen a still to this day no no don't know what it was but it was like it look like an eagle but in fish form was fucking terrifying I literally to get out of the water and I don't even get scared of fish like I'm not scared of any fish like literally I see a shark and not be scared but for some reason this thing looks so much like an alien I just needed out so yeah we did the damn thing but let me tell you the waves were a little bit rough here and there are like a rough but they were like strong but not like unbearable or like deadly and I could not keep my bathing suit on my body and neither can my friend I don't know if we were choosing the wrong bathing suits I don't know if we were if they were bathing suits with stretching out over time because we're in the water for so long I multiple people have now seen my nipples in the state of Hawaii and I am not okay with that not to mention my friend Olivia and I on the last day were just completely getting fucked by waves like we would like we would ride with body surf into like that on to like really shallow and then we would like not move someone to be like right in there that we would sit there and wait and wait for another way to come and just like tumblers on purpose and we wanted to get tumbled like we would get flipped around and she thought it was so funny for some reason but anyway when I did that my Bottom's fell off one time and there was the entire Beach lined up with chairs very close to where I was and an entire family's on my asshole because I got tumbled so bad by this like little wave you know it could because they're powerful but they're small but they're powerful and we were letting it happen and I'm not kidding I was mortified but at the same time I was having fun but the thing is we should I have been wearing like a fucking wetsuit like is there any way to not have your like assholes all out on the beach also add nipple here and there how do you avoid that and it because even it doesn't matter what type of bathing should I wear or my friends we all just are fucking like a dude it's inevitable maybe we're just too rough I think we are really rough like we tend to like swim really like really crazy anyway so anyway that was a nice right about young families it was it was upsetting for these families I am sorry if I ruined your vacation will be looked away quickly if you didn't I'm sorry I like that's just disgusting and I apologize but that was why it was amazing.
