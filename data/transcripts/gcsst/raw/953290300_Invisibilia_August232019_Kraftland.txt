score for NPR in the following message come from HBO's the deuce it's 1985 and the party's winding down as VHS overtakes the pornography industry NYC battles the AIDS crisis and Time Square begins to change watch the deuce Mondays at 9 p.m. only on HBO this is NPR's invisibilia and we are thrilled to welcome you to the first episode of artificial fall season is about once a month we are going to bring you a story that may sound a little different from what you usually here in our spring season maybe a little shorter and made Futurama voice no experts what no experts but the goal of every episode is still to help you see the invisible forces at work in your own life because as we like to say we can't see them you can change so after this deeply intellectual Preamble it makes sense that our first episode of the season will feature a big hunk of plastic a very beloved one producer Megan Cain has the storyfor many years the most important thing in Richard's life was an elephant a five-foot long 12-ft wide shiny Dumbo with a floppy pink hat it was a dumbo from the Disney ride you climb in and fly into the sky Richard had bought it and hung it in his living room and it spent years they're hanging looking like it was about to come in for a landing on to the coffee table for over two decades it smiled at Richard Kraft has he came down the stairs each morning soothing his pain feeling him with fatherly Pride it's the sensation of his friendly face staring at you and I can wake up in the morning go downstairs and dairy is but then one day he decided he needed to say goodbye to the plastic Dumbo just need to walk away put it into it so we put it up for auction the day after I turn 16 I helped carry my sick father downstairs to take him to the hospital there in the sterile waiting room my mother explained as gently as she could that my father was never going to leave the confines of his hospital bed live I heard the words but I was really focused on this children's coloring book that was in front of me I spent the rest of my father's day is facing away from him coloring in the lines of circus animals and kites every time I think about my father's dying days I see that stupid coloring book I feels like a cheat to me why was I avoiding the reality right in front of me hiding in a world of striped tents and dumb dancing dogs was I just too scared to face the truth Richard is the father of a friend of mine and when I heard about his life with them though I felt like I had to talk to him his story and my story start in similar ways because before Dumbo there was a whole other elephant in the room Richard crafts in his older brother David were kids they used to sit at home and listen to movie soundtracks their bedroom walls are lined with sagging bookcases stuff with her vinyl collection and they really love this one soundtrack from brother and I loved Elmer Bernstein soundtrack to the Ten Commandments that corny Charlton Heston Yul Brynner movie and my brother and I loved listen to that record going oh that's the voice of God theme that's the Israeli theme about one-upping each other on soundtrack knowledge something truly wonderful happened each time they fired up the record player they were scooped up from their bedroom floor and whisked onto the floor of the Red Sea now in the world of the Ten Commandments and The Parting of the Red Sea seemed cinematically important and nothing in our real-world felt like that or look like that but the music made us feel that way soundtracks of a kind of special power they're great shortcut to making you feel an emotion it's kind of their whole purpose you know what else soundtracks are good for not feeling emotions I can stop it the records going to end I'm not going to be drowning in my tears for eternity I'll probably be drowning in my tears for the next 3 minutes and 58 seconds as the counter countdown and I know when this thing's going to end there was a good reason for Richard to be drowning in his tears because his brother David was often bedridden with an IV pain to his arm Richard would race home to be with David after a day out from home and relate them back to me that's the endless question I would sneak a tape recorder into movie theaters to record movies and then play it back to him and describe what was going on on the screen while we listen to the audio David had Crohn's disease meaning his body was attacking his digestive system sometimes he would miss long stretches of school because of hospital stays which was hard for Richard because David was the center of his life never going to be anyone in life as interested in every detail of what was going on with me as with my brother the household routine revolves around a chronically sick child but they didn't ever all sit down and check in you know process their feelings of is it a family therapist instead Richards father dealt with things in a different way he made himself the master of Destruction he would take them and what he called scavenger hunts for more soundtracks at the Goodwill he'd bring home used board games all the time but the biggest and the most enticing destruction of them all a yearly trip to Disneyland just a few hours south of their sleepy farming town of a trip to Disneyland was our number one everything's going well today let's go to Disneyland and my brother and I used to pre-plan our trips to Disneyland we headed map of the park on our bedroom wall and we would spend weeks discussing what rides we are going to go on in what order set your emotional thermostat on July and saying hi ho hi ho until your negative feelings Escape you because airing them it must be scary that your brother could be dying at any point of time that never came out the boys grew up and when the brothers were in their early 30s David went in for an experimental intestinal transplant it didn't work and at the age of 35 he died Richards father broke the news to him true to the Kraft family style civically remembered my dad said no big emotions let's I have big emotions really he said that at that time yes on the phone call where he tells me David had died I mean that seems like the perfect time have big emotions right there's no we're saving until something major happened I think it I think in general my dad and I speared if we got into emotions it was going to become quicksand that we would never get out of the cloud that have been following Richard his whole life turn the darkest it had ever been I was lost but I didn't know where to turn on some level he did know where to turn started driving I just somehow instinctually drove to Disneyland Disneyland imagine Richard a 32 year-old man has just lost his brother walking through the tunnel at the entrance of Disneyland coming out into the light saying happy families kids with balloons and Mickey Mouse ears he wanders over to an old favorite ride of his and David's Pirates of the Caribbean he settles into a boat filled with other Taurus definitely felt the most alone it was dark and it was spooky in there and the song yo ho is playing throughout it and it's kind of it's a jolly song contrasting burning buildings and a mayor being dunked in a well and pirate ships firing at each other yet it's it's sort of like chaos with the soundtrack of perky at the boat Wade through the chemical eyes theme park Waters Richard has a thought this was a good idea but it was it was a feeling of satisfaction that I figured out something that might work for me to deal with my grieving is animatronic Pirates could find a happy song to sing as their Town burned down maybe Richard could too maybe he didn't need to feel big emotions about David's death he could just replace them with us on emotions of Disney one of the things I think I've always appreciated about Disneyland is there's a finite amount of time that you're immersed in anything and so I can escape within the attraction for x amount of time under very controlled conditions and then re-emerge outside of it and be okay just like with the soundtracks these rides allowed Richard to step into his face with all the trappings of an emotional experience and when the timer was finished big emotions over at this point Richard was really gaining momentum in his career he ended up becoming an agent for soundtrack composers he had a son so it wasn't practical to go to Disneyland every day but getting older and more settled did not mean he eased up on the high whole philosophy of Life instead he dovin deeper one day he doesn't really remember how but he heard about a Disneyland auction they're asleep green and yellow poster of an old. Hope your ride caught his eye it was on display at Disneyland in the 1950s in the Forefront it shows a father and son zipping along in a car with these big smiles version of the childhood that I kind of had but it sure looks a lot better in the poster and I bid on it and I want it and I hung it up in my office and it was like wait time for Disneyland into my space and I didn't even know that was a possibility but once he dead now he wanted more and he didn't want commemorative Collectibles like t-shirts or keychains know he would have pieces of the actual Park which is how he found himself and his spectacular bidding war with an anonymous phone that are who may or may not have been Michael Jackson at one point Richard got so into it he stood on his chair just to amp up the drama $35,000 and there's a gas and then she looks over at me and gestures with her hand it is yours and the crowd erupts and I feel like a rockstar this of course was Dumbo and with that he was off he bought Jose the animatronic bird from the Tiki Room Jose lipless the tiki room on my gosh yeah the car from mr. Toad's Wild Ride is this beautifully designed car so I got one of those as well as a people mover and a Skyway vehicle little cars that fit for people that travel through Fantasyland also these huge clam shell cars from The Haunted Mansion which are apparently called dune buggies and they're not exactly like subtracting but it's the Dome buggy until his house became so packed with Disney things that his friends are calling his place crash-land and now the only thing people talked about when they came over was the elephant in the room yes I put a $35,000 elephant in the room that could then be discussed Richard wasn't the guy with the dead brother he was the guy with the Dumbo an in-home Tiki Park Jose the bird a dune buggy at this point Richard home is stuffed with Disney memorabilia after the break things get even more out of control stick around this message comes from NPR sponsor wix.com invisibilia dives into human stories that shape Behavior with Wix you can create your own professional website to Showcase your own stories choose a template you love and customize it with text images and videos with hundreds of intuitive design features you can tell your story exactly the way you want it started by going to waste.

Life Insurance Company a member of Principal Financial Group Des Moines Iowa just a few years before starring in Book of Mormon Andrew rannells was way off Broadway doing and I quote it's Karate Kid the musical this is the punctuation it's Karate, Kid colon the musical for legal purposes on it's been a minute from NPR Richard son Nicholas told me that his father had once made a feature-length film about his collection when I asked him to send it to me the hero back with a link and said it is basically the most overproduced whole movie of all time Disneyland's like a shopping spree you know we'll go and I'll be up about weight that's in our kitchen Richard even hired a old Disneyland employee to host a walkthrough of his home collection and I'm here to take you on a tour of the top 10 attractions at one of the wildest craziest most over-the-top home this side of town again seen it all together it just looks over the top so I decided to find a way to ask him if this was you know just binging on empty emotional calories but Richard was one step ahead of me he's done a lot of therapy over the years so he sees all the angles I think part of the emptiness inside of me got filled up with filled up or sidetracked with a new identity as Mister Disneyland collector shockingly owning plastic pieces from a theme park is not really filling up my soul but it's a really interesting distraction okay so it is distraction just like that stupid coloring book I was drawing in at my father's Deathbed but then isn't that cheating I mean I tend to be skeptical of people who just move on way to quickly like the rest of us are just patiently waiting through this hard long process and people like Richard get a cut the front I pressed him again was there ever a time you just face down your big emotions head-on just broke down crying and he told me this story of a relationship with a woman named Karen he was divorced when he met her she was separated from her husband and she works at the church he jokingly called her church lady and she wasn't really super into his collection shoes so mildly interested in it and it was like oh she loves me not because I have The Mousetrap game or because I have Dumbo she love me cuz she must love I remember thinking how nice it was making bologna sandwiches in the morning for her son to go to school it was just lacking drama but it was also lacking flash it was incredibly comforting Richard says relationship he's ever been in but Richard being Richard the desire to add distracting Adventures back into their bologna sandwich life crap back in eventually they ended things Karen wanted to give it another go with the husband she had been separated from it was another loss this time Richard cook differently no animatronic Pirates no Smiling Dental around him just Richard sitting alone on his porch crying rolled into turning down the volume turning down the noise turning down the impulse and then it was like even if I do that it's not it's still going to get the same result is he letting the big emotions in but that didn't quite work out then distraction didn't quite have the same effect on him either one time he stayed up all night at a hotel bidding on hundreds of antique Bridge tallies which he didn't care about it all cared so little that when the Box arrived you can't even open it and then he decided to try a radically different tack he was going to create a show-stopping massive distraction by getting rid of his main distraction once and for all at this point Richard son had gone off to the east coast for college and Richard was living alone he surveyed the dune buggy the Skyway vehicle and they all seem kind of Sunday 10 sad really Melancholy walking around my home feeling would probably be the most empty nesters feel but imagine being an empty nester living in a faux Disneyland so we both stood up and put almost everything in storage the idea to sell at all that didn't come up until 5 years later Richard had a daughter who was born with a rare genetic disorder called coffin-siris syndrome he wanted to set her up for a life and raise money for other kids with special needs that's when he decided to get rid of his collection it's also when I finally understood how the Fine Art of distraction work for Richard and how it helped me take the pressure off of myself for how I behave when my father was died Richard did not just auction off things quietly and anonymously no of course not for a month he took over an abandoned Sports Authority in the valley and made his entire collection into a marvelous exhibit fifty thousand people came out some of them dressed up in Haunted Mansion t-shirts and Disney Princess costumes excellent all wanting to see his collection Richard walks around like he was Walt Disney himself laughing crane spur the moment games awesome shirt I'm here to point out all some shirts I just want to are you enjoying and it was on the second day that I realized he part of Richard's brand of distraction Richards high school girlfriend Janet waves him down and instantly they started talking about all their memories of when they went to Disneyland like the time they went to a souvenir shop and just bought little trinkets for everyone in the shop just to do a good thing after they hug Richard says Play the song about trying to think David is a little kid and he was a little kid to it was true they were monitors throughout the whole place with lots of old family photos and there was David the smile starting the exhibit for partying with the thing that keep the loved all of his life and a lot of people would just quietly sell one case after another and be really going through depression about that and keep celebrating all of this de turned it into a celebration I don't know it's just seems so so very crafts likes me that this is happening Richard wasn't completely avoiding the elephant in the room the giant hole left in his life from losing his brother he was just letting in the pain bit by bit and the same time amplifying the fun around him to soften the blow it's like one of those New Orleans Jazz funerals a quarter of sadness surrounded by waves and waves of joy I need the number to the Dumbo ended up going for $420,000 the first poster Richard bought the autopia one that one for $250,000 two trash cans from frontierland $8,000 some Disneyland bubble bath for 1955 $5,000 Richard gave a lot of that to charity when you're staring down in a motion that could swallow you whole have to find some way to shrink and down into something manageable that's what Richards done and that's what I was doing at the age of 16 with that coloring book I was just letting in reality and reasonable bits that I could handle so I would have become paralyzed because here's the whole truth during those nine months my father was battling cancer I wasn't just coloring I was dancing in the school musicals standing for the SATs the new bad pop music in the car with my friends I was a teenager looking for a Way Forward even with the weight of grease on my back for that so I'm not deluding myself that way but I have to lose myself somehow so I might as well pick the one that's get out I get to live a life that's it for today show invisibilia is hosted by me Hannah Rosen and Elise Spiegel our show is edited by an gudenkauf and
