all right we're live hello I don't know what's up everyone welcome to mine and Devonte Hayes podcast there is no name not yet but Welcome to our podcast we've been thinking about you and podcast for a while now going to see what's up cuz what's up you guys like honesty when I was first setting all this equipment up yesterday I was literally just sitting down on the couch like talking as I felt like a normal podcast in like now. All right so yesterday I got into an argument we got into a little Feud and I was just so happening to go to the gym or I was happening to go to the gym at the same time that you know we got into argument so I'm leaving and then left me so I didn't end up going to the gym when you're mad but I never really understood that hog I was I'm never really the type of person to be able to work out while I'm at like when I'm mad or when something is bothering me I just can't I don't know and I just love this podcast they just keep on rambling to the gym from my house and I was just thinking to myself like I'm not going to go to the gym like this like I'm too irritated so I ended up just going to Guitar Center and I got all of the equipment that we needed in order to start our very own podcast so I end up coming I'm sorry I'm so sorry you do know you. You don't have to burp into the mic you just move the microwave anyways so I handed home and I told d'nicio's like how would you feel about starting a podcast like today or tomorrow and she's like well if you think that's a smart move then you know we can go ahead and will you tell them which is okay so I said I'm like super down for it obviously we're doing it but I had told him you know we plan on getting more consistent in June which is the first day that this podcast should be up so yeah so I'll be more consistent in June wouldn't you want to like be more consistent with YouTube rather than like be more consistent with YouTube first then just like jump into something someone did comment that on Twitter cuz I was like do you guys think we should start a podcast or not and then someone actually said you should try being more consistent on YouTube before I just sent a gif of them shaking my head and say nothing cuz I just feel like like if you're going to do it then just do it like there's no point in waiting we have always been like procrastinating and putting things off to the point where they're so what there's so much stuff I want to talk about okay so before we actually like she bad luck and you guys have seen as mention this like so many times before but we have bad luck with almost everything in our lives and I can't go into detail and be like oh it's because it is and this and this and this like know that we actually have bad luck so I say that to say the reason why I'm glad that we already starting the podcast is because something like this like I me more than likely I'll always think of a really really cool idea for me and wanted to do whether it be a video or something to do you do not have to burp into the mic baby video idea or something to do like just regular off camera and stuff like that more than more so it's always a really bad ass video idea every single time I think of it and I'm just like you do it right and she's like yeah that's like a really really good video we will wait to do it not for any reason we just like with my gosh cuz I know exactly what you're going to say right now and I and it really tickled the bottom of my boot sometimes another YouTuber that idea and insane because I'm like how like okay there's absolutely no way that they could read my mind like at the YouTubers obviously but it's just like oh my God and like me and Monty Hall light show him or he'll show me and will be like are you I just and we get in a few because we will we think the same thing and then I will be like I don't I definitely don't want to do that especially if it mainstream YouTuber did it right before we did it because I don't want to deal with people commenting on our video if they can saying I owe someone so just did that I don't want to I don't want to be I don't want people to be like oh my God you're copying today everyone on you two copies everyone I've definitely got inspiration from a lot of most definitely but every single time they have we always give like what is it like props we always give props where to do or whatever so it's not even really about that but like a steak on it but so we'll see somebody else do it and we're like are you freaking kidding me so with this podcast like I'm glad that we're like hopping on it and we're doing it because I don't think there's any like family podcasters I don't know of any family podcasters either our management team hasn't told us anything about that but I just want to say that like we do not have a like a fancy desk setup or anything like that we are literally laying on our bed inside of our room recording our first ever podcast and I'm just so excited that we're actually like doing this together I feel like I like a radio station hosts have you on as they get older doing what together what are we doing we're just talking in Mike's anyways you guys so I just want to say that if you guys watched yesterday's video cuz I actually I'm thinking okay so I know I said in our video or to you I wanted the podcast I think would be good idea to post podcast Sunday Wednesday and Saturday three times a week or something like that but I genuinely think that it would probably be a good time to just record once and post once throughout the week just because if we're constantly doing it three times a week we really don't have that much to talk about like not not not a lot happens in our lives within a two-day time frame for us to be able to make like an hour-long you know talk thing about you know I'm in so basically what this whole podcast just so that you guys know it's not going to be like based on my teen parenting are like her parents are YouTuber young YouTubers I like it's not going to be like anything like that basically it's kind of just like uncut but like with us like we're Family Channel on YouTube and there's a lot of things that we can't say or we can't really talk about on there so on this podcast where we're going to get to talk about all that we can make it we going to get we're going to get to talk about like mine and Dante's arguments what we argue about because people seem to think that we don't argue and we're perfect like literally not true or even like if there's something that's bothering us but yeah so basically it's going to be just like that I'm going to talk about a lot of things that you guys probably wouldn't expect me to talk about and yeah but that'll obviously be any upcoming podcast I wonder if you were listening to us wall like walking home from school or walk him home or not cuz I know you have been name to David dobrik's podcast we've been listening to David dobrik's podcast walk the moon or even like a while driving will listen to a podcast and like I just feel like I'm listening to like the radio station all over again you know what I mean we are doing a five individuals each of those individual individuals will win $100 and how were how I'm going to do that is I am going to say four numbers throughout the entire podcast and the first five people that message me or DM mean what those numbers are at by the end of the podcast will get that hundred dollars so I do need my phone so that way I don't forget or I can actually want a note section so the first number is actually going to be for all right for that is the magic number I am in my notes section 402 all right I just I just wanted to mention that I don't like I'm just no I don't want to talk about anything I just hate you guys I literally just things that he says that I'm just like they do care they do care that's a damn lie $100 - $100 are you getting any friend that is not me being not humble I'm so humble is all the time of Devonte like I literally just an atheist literally sitting here with a cracked toenail looks like Halfway Gone yeah these are here okay okay okay now I'm sitting up yeah you got yourself okay so first of all you guys I'm back on Twitter oh yeah Devonte surprise me today with he got my Twitter back he's still won't tell me how he got it back but I got my Twitter back is it because I'm working with a couple of people from Twitter on the love of my connection Twitter Snapchat Instagram it's all at and he see a likeness and i s i l i g n e s s it's so freaking funny because I had woken up this morning I told him you see I like I'm going to take sire to go get his ears wrap and when I come back I'm going to bring you a surprise which is pretty much what the video revolved around the surprise was me you know giving her her her Twitter account back her and I come I come back she is literally hiding inside of our room with the door locked yelling I don't want there to be an animal I don't want this to be a prick cuz if there's if it's a prank on we're breaking up and I'm going to my best friend's house like I'm so done because you boil for a while he prank me with bring a snake home a while back and it did for me I'm just not in the right mental place for that late I can't handle that right now so I was like please I checked the card transactions I was tracking his location the entire time and at one point your location so that you were across the street from the album veterinarian place that you want to yeah it said that you're across the street from it and in my head I was like where I was held please like and I was really like going to leave you like I was dead-ass like people can say whatever they want to you can leave all this that's the thing that made me laying here you leave that in a snap of a finger that's where you got me fucked up okay you better change up real quick cuz he's followers I'm going to tell your mom all the secrets that she doesn't know about you mom knows everything about me anyways so she was texting me saying that like she's in she's on the toilet going number 2 because of how nervous she is oh my gosh I obviously you guys Denise it really is something else like behind the camera like it's just she is a character I'm just saying you're something else you're really something else like you're a handful not anyone can handle you so I really do give myself props I'm not him how high you sure but that's so cool. We're just laying down on her bed and our new home making a podcast that's crazy that's crazy to me I mean eventually we're going to get better equipment with all the stuff that I bought all the equipment everything added up together I spent a little over $500 you check the bank account Devante cuz I'm not playing with you right now how did you not know about any of this you check the bank statement earlier today how did how would you not see that transaction action anyways so everything that I bought came out to a little over $500 okay but I understand that the reason why I thought that it was okay to spend that amount of money on equipment is because $18.19 Devonte okay but you have to understand that this is not a good cause we're starting our podcast babe I I have no words right now like no words I mean okay yeah I like $500 that's that's like not that much but it's a lot like that's a lot you know how much food I could have bought with $500 healthy snacks instead of our fans and I'm super excited about it. The last time we went which is the first time we went we worked out legs and glutes So today we're going to do probably abs and we don't really want to work out our arms cuz I do not want to become muscle well I mean I don't really know the middle line whenever it comes down to you know female workouts or anything like that in order for you not to become likes muscley armed strong-in-the-arm but I do know that just like your goal is to pretty much do cardio and then just lose any type of fat that you have been just you know what I mean so that way you can become toned or whatever so I have the Tammy hembrow app and I forgot to look on this app when I was at the gym which is like stupid but I'm a look at it today while I'm there till I get like ab workouts and stuff okay I literally just pulled out three eyelash extensions but anyway I swear an easy house like the worst tantrum ever whenever like she gets her nails done or her eyelashes done and like a nail breaks or an eyelash falls out. Make me seem like that let's tell them how much money you make off YouTube what we're not going to go or not in our contract but it's unlikely YouTube guidelines that you cannot talk about how much you make you're not supposed to discuss how much you make view YouTube you're not supposed to but I don't know there are some people that do it because I can on YouTube you'll be like oh my first YouTube paycheck or like how much do I get paid on YouTube by first YouTube paycheck yeah so honestly there's nothing wrong with it and you know what's funny of where did you record that video don't want to talk to my gosh you guys it's so crazy how the world works it's so in everything comes full circle yeah what's up what what do you want to talk about with me like I'm too I told the nesia that this is kind of like our get away right here we can kind of talk therapy yeah when he said that I was like okay Candice and Casey neistat there podcast oh my God it's insane I love can I see Casey and I said he was ever listen to this but you probably won't I love you and if you guys want to do like a collab on broadcast I'm pretty sure they're not interested want me on there I don't know about you I love them so much because their relationship is so like not perfect but like they have like a love-hate relationship is I mean hate is a strong word but they have each other and they're especially on their podcast and they just talked about everything in living together for so long and I'm just like I just love them I love them and Candice she is my mom is literally like an older version of me I don't understand how she's an older version how do you not understand that you feel like you can relate to learn a whole new level or what you just said that you wanted to collab with okay so this is uncut right I'll talk about anything I want anything I want it spark anyting okay so just sit there and be cute and be quiet every man in America whenever it comes down to YouTube collaborations I don't believe that I have really seen such a I have never met such a more genuine YouTube couple or family other than bramty you know what I mean we haven't really met any other and the reason why I say this is because YouTube family's or you to people in general are very very very selective on who they want to collaborate with and I feel like a lot of people in the YouTube industry that are very big like mainstream do not want to collab with anyone that they can't gain from you know what I mean unless they're really close friends and that's a completely different story obviously but yeah so I have like this beef with the bramfam just because like they don't talk about us a lot anymore they even before like people just swear like every time I get on Instagram live about was always something about the branches 60% of my comments are like the last time you talked to bramty I don't remember to be honest yeah so they are by far the most genuine people I honestly I've ever met I'm not going to lie the way that they act on camera is completely the same off camera so I don't know I just kind of wanted to say that sometimes just thinking about that like there's a snake in my boot you swear honestly I feel like I just have that voice I have that that radio voice you know what I mean ladies and gentlemen welcome. Love yourself like shut the hell up already I feel like me and you are going to have to record a podcast one of these days I'm going right now but you need to understand that we're holding right now for a 15 ft wire so do not make me go inside of our closet and close the door so that way I don't have to be near you talking to you looking at you all I'm doing is listening to you don't respect you that's how much love for you to burp in the mic while I'm talking that makes complete sense yeah yeah you know it's August so I guess it's pretty much to do in so July August two months actually slowed down the street from me I'm thinking about looking into that for her I'm thinking about it is very selective about the schools obviously that should go for any parent in general but she's very selective on the schools that she want Juliet to attend and she really wants her to attend a private school but I'm very surprised because this specific school is not a private school so but it's private schools that I've looked into like online and stuff they're all around like 30 to 45 minutes away from us and for Juliet obviously I would have you drive there Casino walk but I mean if this school around the corner for us is an amazing school then why not you know I didn't I don't even know the name of it maybe we can stop by and have him look up from the school Old Friends new friends friends friends that I really don't care and honestly I really don't even want to look at this platform as a platform to make money I really want to look at this platform as a platform to just talk I just want to talk this is complaint number 36 of the day from an easy Elijah are you okay baby you want me to take you to the hospital for the sixth time this year or if it's all this damn Takis that you ate people NEC is a literally sitting here in cruciating excruciating pain right now from all the talkies that she ate she's on the bed okay so let's go back into the topic that I want to talk about I want to talk about old friends current date what you want to talk about everyone don't you know that we don't give a shit about what the hell he has to say it just cuz I'm more creative than you and I okay come up with the topic right now then an interesting topic right now. You and me okay okay so this segment of the podcast we are going to be talking about old friends current friends and not a fucking radio host shut the fuck up first and foremost I have a very very like I don't know I'm just like I'm very selective on who I become friends with especially now how do you feel about making new friends now now that you're at a high school out of school in general you experienced all the fiction High School whatever maybe fake friends how do you feel about new friends now like right now right now wasn't because I've already tried that I don't want any okay but can you explain like is there a particular reason as to why you do not want any new friends right now I'm very happy with Esther my best friend and I have two other close friends and that's pretty much a that's really all I need I don't and I have you it's so crazy because you go from high school to having like this and there's probably kids in high school who are probably experiencing what we've experienced before you know me talking about having like this whole group of friends this little Posse of friends you guys do everything together and in the moment that you leave High School is when you really really really start to understand who's there for you at the end of the day you know what I mean have you experienced that I literally not this year but last year for the end of the year I lost my other best friend you know who that is I had two best friends understand that these people don't know why she's not your friend anymore what is uncut shut the fuck up bitch by my fucking friend did this is it to today junior a gap in between that just because I had Julia and I kind of wasn't talking to anyone because Julius that was a psycho and he don't want me to talk to but I'm sorry that's not funny but you talked on and off so around like five six years I've been registered for that look but that girl no I'm just tired you took a nap earlier I didn't realize you shithead so shut up so why aren't you guys friends anymore everything kind of just add it up number one reason being she slept with my ex boyfriend I'm just kidding there's there's a number of reasons but like I mean I don't really like care for it anymore, because I don't care if I have none bothered or that supposed to be like I'm bothering you like you're so fucking bothered because I posted that picture I mean I'm over it now but I really don't want to go into it because like I don't care now I'm sure she doesn't care about it either like she has her own group of friends I have mine so the owner so how do you feel okay so that's how you feel about making new friends currently right now I feel like the reason why I don't I just dislike making new friends is because I don't want to go throughout the entire process of getting to know that person you know what I mean and that's that's that has happened with one person and one shot by every time I burp and said podcast thank you that's all been with one person and one person only which is My Gym trainer Joey so that's the only person ever ever since pop high school that I've actually become friends with literally the only person I thought you were saying like you've been run viewers are still in school so it's like if could you give any advice like to any of your viewers right now about like just like School in general or even like friends or bullshiter friends for friends just enjoy it while it lasts don't try to be in middle school or high school being like I only want to smile click right now because I know how it's going to be like bro just enjoy it while it lasts pictures or videos all memories yeah you guys are all going to turn fake I'm telling you Middle School I was probably one of the fakest girls you ever meet I will talk about no I'm so dead like a dude I will talk shit about somebody and then like as soon as I can be like hey I can't really picture you doing that but then whenever If Ever I was confronted about it like I'd be like yeah I said that goes like I don't give a shit like whatever but yeah I know like don't try to be like all like Twitter and Instagram me like I only need two or three friends no makeup big as your friends make hella memories and its enjoy it when you guys don't be friends just like you know who cares so me and Anisha we always talk about how we were in high school and I swear to God we were the same exact person in high school both of us wanted the Limelight both of us. We were funny as hell regardless of what was happening or what situation are not saying that for like any any reason at all literally the other day I was at Esther's house it was me a storm at inside the room and Matt was like if you guys don't know Matt is another close friend of mine and I was talking about something and not goes dude you should really be a freaking comedian like you are dumb funny and Esther was like no seriously like you're really funny like you should be a comedian and I was like all like things games but yeah I know I think I'm hella funny where I'm getting at is mean and he still wear the same exact person in high school and I we always talk about how if we were in high school together during that time we would have fist fight like we would legitimately fist fight because two of the same people like that are not good either they become best friends and it's just hell like they cost all together or they just hate each other because they're jealous that the other person is trying to be funny or has that Limelight you know you can so now that's true I feel like we definitely would have hated hated each other but like everyone would have been like oh they hate each other but like if you want to stop playing like you know you like her or the Keynesian stop playing I feel like me and you would eventually start like arguing face-to-face and we would be so close to where our lives are touching each other because I'm sorry so what the hell are you talking about so I just want to bring this subject up is because I want you to give advice to people that are like who think that way in high school right now like being Top Dog top shit the class clown what do you think was I feel like run with it if you want to be Class Clown or like famous or whatever it is like dude I'm sorry I'm sorry I think not look listen this is what you guys get this is what you guys don't see this is what gets cut out of the block cuz I haven't go shut the hell up because he talks too damn much you were off whatever it is me personally I feel like you should run with it I feel like you should just do whatever the hell you want to do but make sure you're not like being dumb in the classroom I mean by just said class on but I mean Bank jokes when it's the right time get your work done before you and I know it sounds like so like cliche and so much to make a parent I hate that but like I'm telling you guys like you don't want to mess up in school I'm at least high school I just a shit about college but like at least at least it's cool like don't don't mess up in high school I feel like I could for any advice that I can give the people that were exactly like me and you and all I can say is it's not funny it's legitimately not funny and it's it's not going to end it's not going to land you in the right place ended me kicked out of high school dropout like for me I was like I definitely wasn't trying to maybe I was trying to be Class Clown but like also the teachers you really didn't like me from the beginning so that's why I was like what are you two so that's why I like and Miss cook if you ever listen to this I apologize for everything I put you through but I know you didn't like me so let's just be more I've always wanted to I'm never never never the type of person you know this I'm never the type of person to be like oh look what I have I'm flaunting right now you know what I mean but I have always wanted to go back to my high school and for the teachers that hated me I wanted to go there the teacher okay teachers do think in the back of their mind this kid is fucking going to be nothing when he grows up like the way that he's gone right now he's going to be nothing is going to drop out and I did drop out but I made something out of myself from trying to make something out of myself in like half of the world knows who I am and that's just insane like I feel like I want as of me of course because I'm just kidding I take that back and I do not mean that all you wanted to go to my high school and be like now what motherfucker like the people know me in Japan know who are you against people like it's insane and like if the same goes for you in this child like she's she's 3 going on for almost the entire world knows her people in Africa know who she is that's just saying to me it is pretty crazy so we haven't even had a

mic right now anyways because Demonte it was early in the morning we just woke up and I wanted to make breakfast but we have no more eggs so I was just like okay like whatever I could have settled for some cereal like everything would have been fine but Devonte so like oh like I'm going to go buy some more eggs I was like okay that's like cool okay it's not going to take him that long he leaves to go buy eggs and I'm thinking he's buying a regular card of eggs because that's all we have ever bought you guys is a regular sized part of egg that's all we have ever bought okay and that. Specific regular size fits our egg holder inside the kit the refrigerator if it's it okay so there's no reason to buy anything else so I'm not even thinking that he's going to buy anything else so I'm like okay whatever and he comes back from Costco with two boxes of egg whites okay two boxes of egg whites egg white liquid egg white liquids and then he comes back with a crate of five dozen eggs what the fuck do we need five dozen egg for a my head I was like oh you know what like I'm literally not even going to talk about it like I'm just going to make my breakfast whatever so I feel if the egg car everything's fine and then I go to like figure out how all this stuff is even going to fit inside the fridge and I start getting pissed because I was like dude like what the fuck so like I start telling him like I don't know how this is going to fit in the fridge like I can do all the stuff around he's like let me do it or he's like watch out like to like move out the way the fridge and all they know why can't you just tell me that because he's like that like every single time like I'm just like a baby like I need help like I need help like finding this email he'll be like oh let me see no no just tell me just tell me what to do no no okay so so so I was like I know like you could just tell me you said he is like moved out of the way in like do that and I was like okay so I did that and she did it she do is so half-ass but you just like whatever so I did it and then I start like fitting the the egg crate cart thing in there and then what else ya sorry I put the egg hard thing and then I'm like pissed cuz I'm like you guys if you guys seen our pantry and refrigerator reveal on our YouTube channel you know that my fridge is it looks pretty fucking face and I've never had a friend like that so we're getting my fridge to be like this I wanted to keep it that way but no I can't because now I have five doesn't fucking eggs in the middle of the goddamn fridge and it looks cluttered and I said that to Damonte answering all my gosh look at look so ugly now it looks so fucking cluttered I got so fucking mad when she said that you guys like you been with anger and I was kind of just like okay whatever and I like sat down and I was stuck on my phone and then davantes like I'm leaving or if he was like I'm going to the gym or something like that and then like I didn't pay attention and like he just like left eye keeps like left the house and then I know so then I may be 5 to 10 minutes after he leaves I get this like little mini paragraph from him and he's like basis and I don't freaking like I don't like the way you talk to me like okay but don't mock me because it's a serious problem months our relationship so I don't know why you're mocking me when you know damn motherfuking left are you going to do about it cuz you know damn motherfuking while you're making a change about the way that you do talk to me whenever you get mad cuz when you get mad it's a literally uncut I don't care about anything I give a fuck about anyting I'm mad now the reason why I got so fucking angry is because it needs to have the audacity I understand I got five bucks each other next to that. I'm just so tired of buying eggs I'm so tired of it already just fucking figure something out I'm not buying eggs anymore same thing for milk like I'm going to I'm going to buy a refrigerator I didn't fill it up with rods that way we can have extra to check out the reason why I got so fucking mad is because of the simple fact that she said she had the audacity to look me in the face and she said my refrigerator is so cluttered and you guys I was literally seething with anger I literally wanted to yell at her but Julia was in the living room and I had to keep my cool I wanted to yell I'm sorry you have a fucking cluttered refrigerator like I'm so sorry you have a cluttered refrigerator that you need to deal with when there's people out there and it's fucking world who cannot have a refrigerator in general I was one of those people don't like you I did that, so I'm at another level of my life now very hard for what I have now and I don't want some idiot like you coming in and ruining it ruining it with eggs, if eggs just find a place to put them and stop bitching I just kidding our relationship is not this talk to you guys were literally smiling while saying all this you're all mad. Yeah we are going to think and you know what I said that he'll never leave me so try it if you want to anyways you guys so I do want to do the third number so the third number is going to be one so that is the third number we've been recording for almost an hour now, and I feel like there's still so much more that we need to talk about we have even touch base on the house we haven't even given any type of like update on the house whatsoever so I mean we were going through this whole dilemma of like I don't want to say we because it was more more so me I didn't want to do an empty house tour I just didn't want to do one because there's a lot of things in the house that aren't done yet and I just think they're ugly and I just don't want that in my house to where I wanted to make sure that those things were done first and then I'll do it empty house tour but it's taking so long that I'm just like I don't want to do it anymore like now I'll just wait until we get our house furnished and then we'll do a furnished house tour like you know he really wants to do it and the problem with us is that if we have a vision for something especially for a video idea and it's and it's less than what our vision was for what we had planned we're not going to do it at all you know what I mean like if I'm bake a cake for you on your birthday that's my vision I needed to be absolutely perfect and I want the color to be red but it comes out purple I'm mad the video is done it didn't feel right and that's my biggest problem and that's also your biggest problem to that we both need to deal with we need to stop trying to be like perfectionist about it cuz we weren't like this before when we first started out YouTube we just kind of recorded yeah I'll smooth Indiana posted but now it's like you want some parts in there we want certain looks in there and if we don't get it it's not going up and you know it's funny because that was my motto for 2019 make the best out of every situation they're make the most out of every situation possible so I don't know alright so I think this is where we are going to end our very first podcast it just so cool I love I love the idea of a podcast because we can literally just sit down and touch base on every single topic that you don't need to talk about one single topic we can touch we can talk about anything you want to talk about at any moment and it's just really cool because it gets me and you the opportunity to kind of sit down and understand each other in like talk to each other about things that you know we wouldn't want to talk to each other about for mad so I don't know you can end it out baby girl so we like I said before you guys we don't have a name for the podcast yet we don't even have an intro and outro or anything like that not yet hopefully we can get some sponsors rolling in pretty soon have any of that yet but I mean for a first by first podcast I feel like we did pretty good though I really need to tell your mom tell everyone about this if you are under the age of 18 and you've been listening to this and we're cursing a lot listen don't talk like how we talk just kind of set your own example on person don't don't let us influence you in a positive way that's what I want to say cuz we're going to be talking about a lot and a lot uncut things so afraid of you guys who are listening to this don't let it influence you in a negative way understand that we might be joking and we might not be joking this is an opportunity opportunity on a level that they've never been able to you know see us especially on our YouTube channel on our YouTube platform so with all that being said you guys we still have yet to figure out exactly when we're going to be posting a podcast but until then we will most definitely keep you guys updated just enjoy it every time it comes out exactly so yeah you guys we love you guys and we will see you actually know we want we will talk for you guys other podcasts but we will see them in another video what do I eat yeah yeah so I need you to give them the last number the last number is 00 okay guys so for those of you who have all four of those digits make sure you guys DM me or any Thea will actually know DM me so that way I could figure out who the very first person is up to five people into those people win $100 so thank you guys so much for tuning in to our podcast and until next time guys
