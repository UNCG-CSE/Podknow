janish started making trips from New Haven to Madagascar to collect lemurs and they're always very funny stories local stories in the New Haven Register about the Lemurs getting out of their cages are the labs and climbing up to the top of some of those beautiful buildings and crying out so people were getting very impatient with all of his lemurs we're hearing about John but everyone called him BJ and his lemurs from Author Peter koeppel according to one story in the New Haven Register a pregnant lemur once escaped and crawled out the window she climbed up a drain pipe to 1/4 story ledge DJ tried to lure her down he was terrified eventually the fire department was called and she was rescued lemurs are only found in the wild in Madagascar many Lemur species have become extinct and in 2012 they were named the most endangered mammals in the world they're more than a hundred species of lemur they can be as little as 1 oz or as big as 20 lb some have long black and white striped tails some are kind of bald every lemur I've seen as round expressive eyes BJ was one of the first Americans to study lemurs and he's inspired generations of Lima researchers since in 1964 he visited Duke University in Durham North Carolina to give a talk about lemurs a biologist named Peter klopfer attended that talk back then he was a newly tenured Duke Professor his field of study was mother-infant bonding mostly in goats and deer Peter club for does he didn't even know what a lemur was so he was surprised how much you enjoyed BJ's talk he was so intrigued that he introduced himself to BJ after the two men hit it off they talked about research Peter invited BJ to visit the land where he studied his goats and their babies BJ was amazed the Duke gave Peter so much space to keep his animals all he had for his lemurs at Yale for cages they weren't behaving normally in the cages and he'd seen them in the wild in Madagascar the Aesthetics of a caged animal that you've known in the wild are not free and he said wow you've got all this space I've got these animals and tiny little cages because Yale won't let me have any space for proper facility if I let you use my lemurs for your study would you let me have space to house them he wanted to give them some Freedom exactly Peter Club foreign DJ came up with a plan to work together and took about a year to put a motion Beach I got a job teaching a Duke when Peter continued researching mother-infant bonding but in lemurs instead of goats DJ brought about 90 lemurs to Durham and put them in a goat barn on Peters research land then they had to figure out a way to make the land safe and workable for 90 Act of primates how much harder challenge than dealing with a bunch of goats lemurs are good climbers which makes them very good at escaping and some like mouse lemurs are so small they can easily slip through the cracks took almost a year we got the facility built with sizable runs both indoors and Outdoors and fencing that allowed us to let the large loose all together in Forest which we were able to properly fence Winger proof that was the beginning of what is now called The Duke lemur Center the sanctuary dedicated to research and preservation of lemurs complete with a breeding program Peter klopfer has been there since the very beginning in 1966 he still there these days he said he's sleep patterns in fat-tailed dwarf lemurs his hand raised generations of lemurs some the galagos in his home back in the day before the federal regulations on Animal Care and use it came as strict as they know our I would walk down the corridors with leaves on my shoulder we had bushbabies running loose in my house my children grew up with them as Playmates well that sounds fun though it was great fun although it was also costly fun the galagos are urine markers when they urinate they put their hands in the urine and then Mark even I like lemurs Peter klopfer does the T in Vijay we're building something extraordinary it was exciting but BJ was not an easy person to get along with Peter describes him as he go with stick and says BJ tended to dominate conversation according to Author Peter Coble BJ stood out at Duke he dressed up for everything great suits from Saks Fifth Avenue huge horn-rimmed glasses he's short hair was dyed blond he often were large button that red I'd rather be in Paris here's Peter klopfer he was the sort of person who captured your attention and was always on Center Stage loud Julian conspicuous address in a very flashy matter you never saw neckties as brilliant as his and one day you would be in conjunction with a formal three piece suit in the next day you would be wearing in Euro jacket with a brightly colored sash of he was colorful during this time of Duke BJ's career took off he wrote to successful anthropology textbooks students loved him voting him among the best professors on campus he sometimes signed his letters lemur logically yours things were going well for him at Duke but BJ didn't like living in Durham much he said it was a cultural Backwater his wife Veena agreed they got out of town as much as they could often flying to New York just to see an opera was more Kim disease relationship between two siamese twins you almost never ever saw them except together and BJ met in school she always have performed him she went on to become a biochemist she published papers on her own but most of her work appeared to be behind the scenes in her husband's laugh Orthopedic Coble wonders if Vina was in fact doing most of the work that BJ got credit for BJ himself gave her credit for the success of his most famous textbook she supervised all of the research in his lab some of his students that he was rarely there the students that BJ seemed much more interested in having a social life Veena was the one who kept the work moving forward and kept her husband and check Peter klopfer remembers the DJ had one of the biggest personalities imaginable that he would dramatically demand money from the Department even banging his fist on the table on the table saying I need another 1/2 million dollars are I'm going to leave this place and he did that once too often we went to press a Roberts head of the anatomy Department said I've gotten this offer is the chair of the anthropology part in the New York University unless you give me such and such I'm going to go and the Robertson and heard this once too often and I've told responded by saying well John I'm sure we all wish you well at your new job 1973 BJ left Duke moved to New York taking the job at NYU meant leaving the Lemurs behind he would still study them from a distance but occasionally returned to Duke to collect blood samples for his research between Vena Garden Apartment overlooking Washington Square Park they hosted elaborate parties and we're regulars at the New York Philharmonic by all accounts their life was where they wanted it to be so when Vena had a abdominal complaint that couldn't be diagnosed and it was suggested that she undergo an exploratory surgery from which she did not recover it was a stunning stunning event I mean all of us because Vina gave every impression of E Hale and Hearty just headed abdominal pain that wouldn't go away and no one thought it was anything really serious and then she died on the table after she died that that's that that's where I think the problem arose I'm Phoebe judge this is Criminal after Veena die BJ's research nearly slowed to a halt the National Science Foundation do funding BJ was Furious his work in the lab NYU continued but now on a much smaller scale unpaper BJ was still studying lemur blood but in practice no one working in the lab was quite sure what he was doing one of his graduate students described as a social gadfly he started spending a lot of time in Greenwich Village going to gay bars his hours at work became unpredictable and when he did come into work his behavior was odd what is BJ's research assistance was an undergraduate student named Richard makris BJs Richard makris to meet him at the lab it was a Saturday there weren't many people around when Richard got to the lab Beach announced that they be making something called an acetal and turn illick acid BJ said it was for lemurs Richard didn't believe him he started taking detailed notes of the goings-on in the laugh he told another professor what BJ was doing and that Professor Clifford jolly it's not going to the lab to take photographs and collect chemical samples he sent them to the DEA to be tested BJ was making with aquilone better known by its brand name Quaaludes the sedative that was very popular in the 1970s sometimes people called them Disco Biscuits immediately began an investigation besides Quaaludes they found traces of LSD including something BJ allegedly plan to self as a quote chemically pure form of synthesized cocaine even using nyu's lab to make party drugs and his students were helping him some knowingly others not BJ newest students would be interviewed by law enforcement so we gave them some advice and said if you are quizzed by the prosecutor before he interrogates you go ahead and take some tranquilizers because then you can deny charges without giving yourself away even if you're taking a lie detector test will one of the students was wired the student wearing the wire got BJ on tape which meant that BJ was now not only charged with manufacturer in possession of illicit substances but also with obstruction of justice he denied everything here's Peter Coble he spread the story that he was making quote neurotoxins on quote to experiment on his lemurs and they're going to be used for behavior modification so basically when BJ's called he say what's the big deal I'm making drugs for lemurs yeah that's that's what he said and the Whole Foods and lemurs defense strikes me as patently Ludacris no one has agreed to allow him to test his drugs with lemurs the whole thing just doesn't hold water for me BJ continue to stick to his story and said he'd plan the experiments with his Duke lemur Center co-founder Peter klopfer but at the same time I figured o l okay they caught him was illegal drugs needed an excuse what do you think was going through BJ's head I think that he was able to justify just about anything he did the sense of entitlement was overwhelming. He was a genius and could get away with whatever you want at I think you did yeah and not even that he was a genius but he was a man of privilege Beyond reproach and above suspicion over the years BJ's former colleagues and students have come up with all kinds of theories about why he did what he did and how he became so self-destructive some say he just wasn't himself after Vena. He became too overwhelmed with grief others have suggested that after she died he realized she been the one doing all the work that she been the Real Genius but others say he was just trying to make money and have fun a brilliant widower trying to entertain himself you just have to pick your explanation DJ was convicted of conspiracy making illegal drugs and lying to Federal investigators federal judge Charles Bryant presided over the trial he sentenced BJ to five years in federal prison at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida BJ worked on the prison newsletter called the Dewan X Peter Coble rights that BJ turned his cell into a tiny office reviewed book manuscript for friends and continue to work on scientific papers when a friend visiting the prison DJ introduced his fellow inmates as his colleagues but BJ continued to say he done nothing wrong he wrote many letters to friends outline the ways in which he believed he been wrong in one letter he wrote that upon his release quote I will certainly take the most awful Revenge upon certain people the Greeks are correct blood is a corrective for many wrongs we'll be right back support for criminal comes from betterhelp betterhelp online counseling offers licensed professional counselors or specialized in issues such as depression anxiety trauma family conflicts and more connect the dedicated professional counselor in a safe and private online environment anything you share it's confidential get help on your own time and at your own pace if you're not happy with your counselor requesting you wanted any time criminal listeners get 10% off the first month of a discount code criminal go to betterhealth.com criminal fill out a questionnaire to assess your needs and get matched the counselor today betterhelp.com / Criminal thanks equip for their support quip is the remarkably simple electric toothbrush created by dentist in product designers to help you create healthier habits what helps you get an effective clean with built-in timer pulses remind me to switch sides I really love that there are no wires or clunky charger and it runs for three months on a single charge but start to just $25 I know that your first refill free at getquip.com criminal again go to get quip.

The judge's wife ate four pieces of chocolate and became extremely sick she lost Consciousness and wasn't found until judge Bryant came home from work and rushed her to the emergency room she was in critical condition for several days but survived the FBI determined that each piece of chocolate in the Box have been poisoned with a different toxic substance one piece on eaten by the judge's wife could have killed her and when the FBI tested the outside of the Godiva box they found a fingerprint she started making these candies and he always fashioned himself as The Gourmet cook and he made these candies he also fashion these poisons from Fairly esoteric substances and he made these candies and put them all in a good diver chocolate box and sent them to the judge out in Westchester on Valentine's Day in 1987 so it's been about 4 years since he been released so it just goes to show how long you could holds grudges police later learned the DJ hit send boxes of chocolate to several other people he felt it wrong to him including someone who wants to know I'd him 10 year in the end everyone recovered a teacher's arraignment the New York Times reported he was a weary looking apparently ill and wearing a hearing aid he pled guilty to the attempted murder of Judge Bryant Peter Clapp for wonders this was all part of some kind of plan but he wanted to get caught or there's no doubt in my mind it was invited I mean this was a brilliant man whatever else you may say about you don't send toys and chocolates to a federal judge in stayfree on the street to talk about it not if you send them in a way that invites Discovery interests which is what he did of course he practically had his return address on the parcel in the apartment kitchen all of the poison paraphernalia and the chocolates they were laid out as if on display that furthermore the package was mailed from a mailbox at the corner where his apartment was why does he want to get caught my guess is that Venus dad my life is over let's let's let's end and so he sends his poisoned chocolates knowing that that's going to send them up for life because he didn't know way which invited Discovery interests this is not a mistake DJ was sentenced to 40 years in prison he was sent to the supermax prison in Marion Illinois the prison that have been built replace Alcatraz he started working on a new book about the Lemurs of Madagascar and like before BJ stayed up to date on the latest scientific journals subscribed Hopper news and exchanged letters with his friends especially with Peter klopfer what was his mood in those letters clearly despondent but mine still actively working still coming up with ideas kept asking me to look up particular papers summarize the contents for him I did ask him what on Earth LED you to do this and he said I really don't have any recollection of having done it but if I did do it I deserve to be into prison even though BJ had tried to implicate Peter in his Quaalude making scheme and attempted to murder a federal judge Peter says he wasn't angry at his friend he felt sorry for him and says BJ needed to be protected from himself read write long letters reminiscing about their trips Madagascar Peter would update BJ about what the Lemurs were up to in Durham one day Peter got a different kind of letter from BJ and so we wrote to me one day and said I've just discovered that I'm hiv-positive and probably have AIDS this was back when there was no antiviral medication and you had AIDS you had a death sentence DJ died at the age of 67 in a prison hospital he was cremated and his ashes were spread on Cranberry Lake in Wisconsin near where he grew up when was the last time you heard from him just about the time he entered the hospital with his final bout of pneumonia just before he died what did he say he was in the he knew he was dying is a lot of having severe pneumonia and I don't expect to recover and then he went on to talk about some one of the scientific issues we've been discussing another the people throughout your lifetime there maybe five or six that are real characters that you come across would you said that this he's up there as being one of the legislative colorful character of any of the many I've known no no doubt about it BJ's obituary ran in the American Journal of physical anthropology is almost two pages long almost all of it speaks to BJ's professional accomplishments the strides he made in the anthropological world the love of his students felt for him his award-winning text books and articles it only briefly mentioned has two convictions the obituary Ends by saying that BJ quote made a strong impression Sometimes good sometimes that some of his actions were and will remain unfathomable to us the world is a Saturn and duller place without him today the Duke lemur Center is home to the world's largest and most diverse collection of lemurs outside of Madagascar you can visit and take a toy criminal is
