Com so we don't think we're going to do this but actually really fired up that we did the SVP Russillo podcast people's like wait a minute so I just didn't want to make it this thing where we were just going over a lot of the same stuff so instead we did a retrospective so I guess in a way we kind of did that but whatever the final of the podcast and I got this little bit but just because I feel like you know everybody 2017 that's pretty much it. I'm rambling a bit here but it's just one of those things where I feel like people to say goodbye to me for over a year-and-a-half and I'm just like okay like it's awesome and it's it's really nice to hear from everybody but I got a man inside of you like I had enough of this guy sing One More Time by Daft Punk really really loud but I've since I don't think you we have the like the rights I guess that Vince the Rudy have to dump it like I can't sing that can I all right or what I don't why Daft Punk. Want to go I just didn't know you're not feeling any notes we're just going to do are 10 best memories from the SVP and Russillo years onine 2015 so I mean where does one begin I mean there's so many ways to go here I'll just go I'll start with this to me represent our show and represent us and represent like eggs and Grudge and all the Sprites as you at work celebration man like you guys out there that are listening you got us we got you and it's been fun but we'll celebrate let's just have some let's start in Elgin he said to you hey fellas shows really doing great we want to send you on a remote to Boston what would be the equivalent of Elgin for Boss where would you actually be setting up shop. 124 outside of Worcester actually got in the minivan and drove to Germantown is a remote in DC and Chicago is really into what they want you to come clear and I got some sort of a taco salad it was really nice and I had unlimited iced tea and it was fine it's just when you're driving on the highway it doesn't matter when you land at O'Hare the traffic is always the same as always awful we will and we were in it after the show and we just kind of chuckled ourselves about which is a show but it was repelled show and it's Ricco schedule for which era field Operator by ESPN and it was LA to Chicago and how you didn't know what I was and so are only piece of real estate on NoNo affiliate was one hour in Chicago so was the show I bake Chicago feel like we were we love that you and I both would put that City easily probably her top Chicago beat it and doing well in Chicago of Chicago seconds in that one hour somehow the show wasn't successful it was mind-blowing cuz you're like 3 hours or on all over the country and yet so it was the one thing you want to keep that relationship really strong like Roadshow hear you out Chicago and we doing at the guys on are are like where you going why are they sending you the elgin's exactly what happened. It's on us to do so you guys are like making fun of why we showed up and it was always a weird thing is that when I was there and I wasn't big enough and it's okay because you know he was like like what he's at this guy and I met him know for 30 minutes we talked about the whole thing and then after that was like okay fine solo because you had this ridiculous sports center schedule so there was always kind of like what is the show at the station but hey how's it going on your solo shows are terrible music have you gone back and listen to them we have to have you on that hours at Chicago so early on Chris Mullin College invite me to the all-star celebrity game that was my second favorite athlete of all time by Charles St John's early 80s maybe in a little kid by Jersey my father like we're not going to go to Queens to go watch St John's game will wait till they come to Hartford and then you fast-forward 20 something years later and Chris Mullin surprises me to call into the show to be like hey and then it's one of those moments where they become numb to this these guy that you watch these guys are you idolized at this moment where Chris Mullin is calling it and it's harder to pick somebody who's actually is real and cool day today is Chris Mullin is so true commercial break and Jay-Z comes on ringtone one of those things were reading a perfectly turn to be to go that must have been really cool for you right then I got to know what we don't let the moment thinking enough I'm going to let that one sink in so that was always one of my favorite things that ever happened in 6 years let's keep the positive momentum going out just say Matt Damon write an interview for Invictus keeping it and since we're taping it did we tell him we were going to do it or did we just start doing it okay not to ramble and take yours but just a really important backstory is we were convinced we were going to do the Boston accent interview with him and we kept talking about it and we were supposed to have them in studio and we thought okay we can play this out we can reduce face when you were like no way no way am I doing this and I might come on cuz I kind of sucks but whatever like if this means Matt Damon doesn't like us and we're not to become friends and hang out with him there's a pretty good chance I was going to happen anyway and so we did the interview normal and then I just looked at you with the Antigo screw it let's just do it let's do it right and you were kind of right to be like I don't know a man that doesn't go over well it's going to suck and then we did it and it was one of the best interviews ever the part where you hit him with the line it's not your fault and there's a pause in an election happen in a brief pause where you look maybe that's all flat but then you hear him through his nose right guy Campbell you've seen the way he carries himself your life and you just assume that's whatever your version of that's who I think we all project him to be a new hope that you got in one second he gets the joke and he loved loved it he is one of those moments really it's awesome the payoff is incredible and it just I don't know I don't know how there's plenty of famous dudes if that were to his moment where he be going from Sacramento to Boise cool what is a shuttle on the couch cuz I was going to do that with Krasinski Jim from the office it was me and him was a solo show and we were promoting I think his military movie right this is after you you would bounce but I had wanted to do an entire interview where I played it as if you were actually gym as if it was real and I'm not trying to tell people when they're being sarcastic is admirable to method acting you know how freaked out as Pam cuz I just you have this small and I played it straight and I told him what I want to do cuz he's like he told me that he would have not thought it was funny at all and I kind of still wish I had. Who cares either way people a second time and I would run into hung out whatever you want to do something together cuz I did that interview with him for the ice skating movie where they steal the video game play Glory let me put my poems LSU guys out with him at a wedding that he was at that was my friend's wedding and then I ruined it when I wanted to say hello to him and started laughing try to make eye contact and I can see him doing the don't make eye contact cuz I just a bit smaller and I'm trying to just pick up some dry cleaning and grab a sub if it's so bright red bell peppers that says huge huge Ackman was the one where you just go we can do whatever we want with this guy cuz he's that nice picture to my buddy in Chicago who had about Wolverine for Halloween and he subversion him with his shirt off for a decade-and-a-half so what we use every year that the joke was funny to pick here for one of celebrity ones that went horribly wrong there's only one yeah Hammer you and I have had a conversation about where it went wrong and I blamed you and you were blameless but when you early on I asked a question about Third Base it was clear that we took her I felt like we took a U-turn in the wrong direction yeah I wasn't massaging I would try to do the good cop bad cop with you is what we were known for only on when they were license and then I go see base is dishes you a video like what's that like and he gets so pissed but he also is there promoting a reality show talking about how famous people go broke so that was kind of a tone to so it's like will pay you know how do you but you came here to promote your deal that's one of the things that the SPN that I always loved ESPN for which the celebrities never seem to understand is that I guess what the doors are still going to open no matter who shows up here okay these shows are still going to do well without you and sometimes celebrities would show up thinking like me and if it wasn't for me not at all like it's awesome let's promote your thing but if your show is promoting people going broke and you famously went broke what was the joke one of these insurance companies which is the premise of what's going on I mean what it was like and then he had some people with yeah he was he was really mad at us if I did not massage but it wasn't our fault no because of the end to it was so uncomfortable this is not this is just be remembering the interaction where I started shaking all the people there looking at him like who's the city of his name is even on the show and like shaking hands and going to have UFC management like let us know we'd love to have you back in a little bit and I ruined it was just eight eight comfortable minutes which I don't know if that's a good segment for a name of a segment but that's what they were really good if we just had everybody in all that hey this is going to be a really bad interview do that where the audience do the interview was going to be terrible but the guest didn't know and that was the whole point that you would do something where it could be 8 minutes and you would just spend I don't know like 214 really draw out the pain I've had some ideas I think I'll save Ronda Rousey interview went South is quick as anything I've ever been a part of where the whole time as Rouses destroying everybody it kept coming up so she would beat Floyd Mayweather in a fight about it she talked about an actual thing where it's like we could because she bigger and if it were octagon rules like would she be able to take it down when she's incredible man all the different stuff UFC High Top that story line so to be if it was actually part of the thing everybody talk about Rossi comes in she was in a good mood that day cuz she's done other interviews where you're like so you want to promote something all day and you hate everybody for asking questions like alright cool he's done that plenty of times since the rear you were like should we ask that question I go yeah one of us has to ask the question just kind of see where it goes with the question if you just said will this whole thing would that be something you would want to do and then she went so she said I would never want to be a part of anything were of group of thousands of people were cheering a man to to be brutally going out of a woman tour like pom pom pom bomb like oh okay now we feel like yeah I know you guys are promoting it is it is it is a promotional thing for the UFC for like a month so it would just go to Baton at around 4 that right like it wasn't our idea okay. Question because you guys been talking about it Non-Stop and now we're jerks got it here in a second but first Tommy John there's a lot of underwear Brands out there they claim to be big on Comfort true then why are 75% of men and women dissatisfied with their underwear my hunches they haven't tried Tommy John the Revolutionary underwear brand it's upgraded over 1 million live Tommy John doesn't just claim to be the most comfortable underwear on the planet they actually have the number of pairs of Tommy John underwear four stars are greater with Tommy John's revolutionary underwear the legs never ride up in the waistband never roll down there horizontal Quick Draw fly has been proven year and they're Featherlite their fabric guarantees zero visible panty lines for women online such a super soft loungewear polo shirts and apparel have a bunch of t-shirts they are awesome for formal events Tommy John is so sure you're going to love the fit back by their best pair you'll ever wear or it's free guarantee that means if you don't love your first pair you get a full refund no adjustment needed SVP now to get 20% off your first order, Tommy John. Com SVP let's keep it Loose keep going down but let's keep going down there that the angst in the head butting I just have the fight where you and I and a break peeled the paint off the walls did the Homer Simpson's dad hat on a hat rack because whatever had been building between us and then you you bit your lip and didn't come across the table and Route and rousing me and then we had a great rest of the show and I think from there as I recall it was sort of like we'd let the pressure out of the out of the tire and we are six years that many hours a day and have less than five fights I think is a huge Testament to our friendship in this kind of understanding each other as well as we do right Alpha School certainly not having it not afraid to let people know we didn't really have that many fights but that was that was something that you don't for you to be the established and me to be trying to just prove everybody like what's happening with me forever and I did some things wrong where I just ease into it I was like let's roll like ready to go and that it was always battle early on and stuff it really had nothing to do with you and so this is something I've apologized to you for help numerous times but just so everybody understands the core of that argument that day was I would look at Steve if you ask that question and it's such a jerk thing to do it sucks it's a bad team the thing I hate that I did it and I did it and you never called me on it until that day and it was something that happened to break come back I looked behind the glass you called me out on the air for doing it which I deserve and then I kind of went back at you and then you screamed give me another ghost dad on the air by actually started shaking the best dad then we talked down and it was great we needed it any Partnerships number of hours is the number of creative kind of turtles that you have to sort out when will you have people and you are the more creative energy to push the boundaries and I'm sure that got frustrating cuz you deal with somebody that they will just talk about the game what was the ski was it was it was amazing but there was dead that what is is memorable it was if we took the volume to 11. Around it we really didn't become a great show I think until we just relax or I should say I relax let's tell them stories let's just take it a direction where has to go where I know it has to be this way it has to be this way now that's a bad idea that's a bad idea stop debating it's a bad idea next topic and I was like rigid but I still felt like I was doing it the right way to eat so you actually seriously dude to handle it like a champ this is a real Minor remember until I tell you now cuz it was just so weird and out of character for me but we were doing some speaking agency or something in New York City and I just drop an F-bomb in the middle of it to warm up to the room and I so awkward weird and you just looked at me really know it was it was an awful read on the room we were sitting up there director's chairs were going back and forth and real good vibe is really loose like yeah you know I think it was in front of appetizers it's just a tip for the kids listening right now never be so comfortable in front of a group that you just start dropping an F-bomb on a potential out of time by until wait till the 1st there you go all right that's what that was marked I Mark 40428 he was like let me know when he swears right there will you swore so I'm doing this we're okay so what exactly I mean that if a shot to our friends big cat and PFT over and over bar stool I mean Summit like their whole thing about Rushmore season is at 8 is is taking me idea if it's summer radio or summer podcasting that's what you got your creating stuff you're you're making lists you're you're finding things where there's nothing and so we were put together a list I hope it was in the summer of my time has been the fact that I suck at lists because it really was I mean that's Lucy's and I can just I give you a thousand is being like I probably will small forwards agree we did the top 5 small forwards I don't know he's tall is a power forward so just let me do it cuz you do it wrong and to this day because any time something comes up on television channel list I've always said I enjoyed watching more than anyone else and put them in the wrong position in my mind I don't know on a previous list or something so I had fun with it cuz I show up its deep ghost small forwards and I'd like to snow Durant because I know I'm not going to tell him that it's not like I could you can thanks man you were like what are you talkin about you like he's the power forward for like a baka baka so that I have a small ball 5 though you know that we are Ford okay I'm a checklist here you got to do Fort Worth I don't want to take it you need to do Fort Worth okay ECU guy that may be my last thing the stairwell in Fort Worth it's up there for our first Super Bowl remote right was our first one together Fort Worth was our second one's pretending ratings were our fault or something I don't know whatever we were in our weakest is seriously one of the most just fun, this is a huge deal on on the rise in this is going to be amazing and they had a marquis are they listed Mike and Mike and they listed the herd and then they listed NFL Live or whatever was on it was in lieu of us do to use for television and we weren't allowed on it so they had to find us auxiliary accommodations which is like a metaphor or you think that I am I'm guilty of hyperbole which which definition is exaggeration for effect there is no exaggeration here we were set up on the outside of a parking garages stairwell now you're thinking wait what do you talk about to turn around and go up on the flat part a desk and they put a camera halfway up the steps and I had just heard of a flapping in the breeze backdrop and we just looked at each other like is this a weight know this weekend that's where we were set up it was going to be a week of elevators work in a parking garage and you have to take the stairs and you go there's also a urinal here and recycling center which is not what it is like it was it was for people that were using it it was in use it was nice program stairwell 15 hours for the programming itself Guy Harvey right and then my name wasn't on the deal and it was like you know you're you are word continue to be like you are the star so I was like okay this sucks but I can get mad at Scott so what's talking to do in your set that first night we saw it and then it was like this isn't like last year were sharing the beach set with countdown to do I deserve this is insane how will this feels to the next year was like actually hears your stairwell the one thing that was always kind of a deal as you do like you couldn't have told us this ahead of time and it's like hey this is great set up and everybody's looking at you like I can't believe how terrible but look at the view look how great the view is you have a few of everything this was some sort of whatever the Fort Worth your set coming up I was that's a tough one for like a Hall of Fame talent to apologize that he's walking up and there's like a wino pain in the stairwell that didn't happen that is actually metaphor there was no fun if you were want to look at it because God is good everyday weather ever a storm knots in the car and the guy threatened to just drop us off on the highway and go home cuz it was too dangerous for him and people were screaming at him and then like the stuff collapsed member there's like ice in the other options and whatever they put all of us indoors because everybody try to say hey guys get a hot dog.. Use for what I just never understand how our side is that those ESPN on the ground people whether they're out of Bristol or the remote or their freelance people that are higher than that part of Texas because we spent time in Fort Worth news in the whole summer Square thing was apparently like a big Disney stockholder who was just like whatever USP and he's like let's do what that first college football playoff we were down there there there was a party I mean the whole thing was the Super Bowl thing so I have more time at Fort Worth and I think I'd ever imagined that I ever would but for the crew to just take an office which was part of ESPN's headquarters and just turned it into a TV studio all day long with ridiculous music. The show with the heads is this a cuz we got our promotional thing where we had those huge heads of us and she thought it was the funniest thing you've ever seen the show with the big heads that sucks I watch it every day will finish up businesses connect to qualified candidates that place is.

Edmonds where we just lay it all out and we ask each other who's the biggest jerk out of everybody that works in the show cuz it'll have a lot of interaction with the people behind the scenes of frowned upon until people behind the scenes prove they can be heard on the radio that everybody loves the idea this is a career-ender he's like do not do that you guys are all going to get way too personal way too nasty he's like don't do it and as I'm at the whole thing out around in order and ask the other guy a question that's historically something that he's done that he's a jerk about we're just going to let it all hang out and I had another moment maybe we should do this because this to get hurtful nasty and who knows like what are the stakes on this thing like across the line and then we'll figure it out forever because it worked perfectly we nailed it could have gone better and we actually didn't hate each other after the fact that the most amazing part because I was like you the reason that I had there was we were going to do it and then we we kind of shoved you just can't walk away from cuz I could have happened you and how memorable was to me and how Crystal Clear Eye Care when I went in on Ray and Ray was our producer and who's the jerk was perfect because it was it was us at our most us it was all inside jokes and yet the people that were listening or watching they were they got them right they knew what we were talking about and what I wanted was our producer who is notoriously stingy with praise and when you start doing the polite like chocolate I'll never forget and then why did he ever tell us in the history of our show that we have done a good segments and he's kind of started it but I just was firing back in 00 about his answer you like how many times have you ever said we had a good second how many times the answer is 0 it was true but I think he's all right cuz it got it got like super still taking some hits in the recycling visit that because you brought it up again it's up to the recycling to nobody that guy's birthday rolls around like I taken the day off so what are the credible question from Steve men or women have specific subset which of the match for the Stanford Steve oh my God was so good answer no I do what you say cuz I said you know flour really I go I go well and I think the best way to answer that is that in the beginning guys don't like me advance if you get it if you get invited inside of the hard candy exterior there I could be a great great friend by five consider myself one of the most loyal if you're my guy like you are my guy and on the other hand on the other hand interests he's got he's got multiple real estate Investments books all the time not pretending to be a writer works out he has he goes down these elaborate trips he has access to all of these things and then it's like closed doors and I'm about that just delighted that I I still have a few more if you said so do I was the chair collapse that was the New York remote for the that was the Seattle blow out again slowly caught my foot in this thing works like grabbing the top of backwards against their leg and that's what the chair was doing and it happened while we were on TV and I could tell it was happening and so it was horrifying because it was I knew that there was excruciating pain to buy a and then yet because of a guy part of it's funny cuz it isn't happening to me I actually it hurts so much that I had killed at that age I wasn't hurt for too much stop it right now this thing sucks. But I'm going through a lot more than CBD to make that pain go away now at this age yeah right I would have to get on the high-test up from the research that. But I still feel very proud of the bench press numbers being totally natural although I can't do anymore so whatever I just got done with something a little bit lower than that I went you could do it but you left PEC me also rip off too cuz there's some lingering thing there is seriously every time I try all right workout topics good stuff my father by the way to work and I'll take a little bit at all times which we appreciate it though I know it's kind of funny because it's not really who you are now you're pretending pretending I have some of that you're ignoring all the good things you do the stuff you do for your family and I was like yeah cuz that's a good number the inventory never that heavy metal band we just read it and heavy metal voice the whole time but you guys even realize what's coming out December 29th I do remember that they were really off the radar so we were but we just went with it and it was like hey no no and then the advertiser actually loved it so do that more let's see here smaller one it was one of these early creative days we look back on if you need any more and we would pick a game on the schedule we would try to not tell the other guy which I don't even know why we cared and we had those boxes like literally cardboard boxes that were big enough to cover two helmets because that was the budget cuz that's what we had right if we would like you're at here whatever and we would unveil it and then whatever game you pooped then everybody would actually think you were going on social media. Remember that very very early days we were in the Mike and Mike studio and we had the box that we just hid it under which if you look back on it was kind of like low-hanging fruit segment but we have a beginning of the show is like hey we need some big build-up reveal deal but the reason I bring it up is that actually was the origin of the helmets at Colgate sent us a Colgate helmet and I think they were playing Yale I just remember you doing Eastern Michigan and they got everything they were really struggling but they were so happy that we showed their helmet but that's the level of God to even if our ship videos different program started showing us videos of their locker helmet matchup going to cuz it was just it was just performance art you did a Wyoming one where the end call me in any way if we send a private jet he'll come so even with serious even when we're a long way from Laramie folks like lots of jet fuel course there was a little spiteful part of it with me cuz I was like you know I was kind of the first acts from Wyoming thing you invented it and I hijacked the bit a allowed you to hijack it because it was like stop by will get you a couple General mission in the 100s but speaking of Chicago again I was on like a weird whatever deal and then there was like this thing that was happening where there was there was maybe a shift worth like you know look we can do better than Russillo I know of some of the stuff is happening behind the scenes that you would not tell me about the news you want to tell me the worst mood that day absolutely know what about this how about no that was happening I think it describes me a lot so for the people that didn't understand like who this dude was just with a highlighter going with a salad bar every single day not saying hello to anyone I was like why just work really really hard and focus on things and that will solve all my problems and if there's a kid that doesn't work go to building for knock on doors say hello to all the decision-makers because I know who the is are on every Tuesday so we had a manager that came by which is amazing cuz this is kind of how my whole thing that saved is he walks in the commercial break shows are raining in 1 1/4 in Chicago and we jumped 25% for whatever reason and this stuff could be a is fragile is the Cubs sucked that that too much stretch or you know somebody got traded from from the basketball team and their free agency thing was born Chicago our assigned don't say nothing to do with any of the digital downloads had nothing to do with any of it like the growth of the show he would like it when you guys went up like 25% in one rating book on the 1-hour that we care about so let's recycle Zillow just on the beach somewhere by now right well technically already am I know it's like a 4-Hour show for the people that are still listening right now we're going to run this back and by the way I just really did a couple but you don't care about the numbers but it's nice for us to see how many of you downloaded it to listen because you were excited to to to hear us together again. Means a lot and and you all are summed up in my mind Forever by one picture and that is and one guy on January 13th 2015 old standing by himself holding up a ECU and the reason that all the metaphor is it anything and yet completely random pick up the day after Ohio State beat this person did that I don't know what I still don't know why I don't care either one of those ridiculous that was also a crazy cold was the college football playoff because of that you remember and then other show started going inside and it was so cold and then I'd said something in front of somebody who remembers this is brutal why did he actually said to me cuz when you go back to Bristol then what's the point and I was like okay we were looking for three straight hours for this is an NFL wide 30 minutes outside so yeah like we could type something you guy came comes by with Edward Fort Worth and kid spray paints and purple letters ECU on a whiteboard it just holds it in the background to get into the shot and you and I like just started dying laughing does Egyptian dump or got sweaty balls or if I said they got what this was because we got that guy and maybe that guy just was represent something which is everybody out there that turned up to say hello or cable remotes for status tweets or even the ones that to me is Goofy has the most most obscure or maybe the idea of what this time what are was on radio or here or anywhere else was yeah that's that's really perfect and I don't I don't want I have other stuff but like you know your first LSU Bama game where it was McCarran to throw against that Blitz on the left side and he was just the perfect play call and LSU people as much as it was disappointment it was like man this was the best it's ever been in that was like maybe 12 yeah yeah one tiny little section in Baton Rouge of the people with the Alabama shakers and Thursday that's the best environment for a sporting event that I have ever seen this is stained level of enthusiasm million dollar band ever been in and that was really for me to have you get to see it cuz I would like I can't wait and you know everybody down Baton Rouge that we've been over 2 million times it feels like another place where there's a lot of places you can visit there's a copay I really like it and it's funny cuz the LSU people are friends would like you don't even hate Alabama I don't know how you could respect what they do and was awesome to us all the time like I really like going to Tuscaloosa but they're very few people are very few places in the world that you can go to and I don't want to say cuz it's going to say and it feels like home cuz it's not but the world will end in feel so comfortable because the people there want you to feel that way and for that you to get to share it with us a couple years later after we had to talk it up for ever being like you got to get down here man it's nutts it was all that more so there's a lot of other little things sometimes I think about the show where it's like all right you guys it was four years ago but everytime weather at the podcast when it comes out of like it just kind of yeah I mean it's a little Bittersweet cuz you like to have it like we actually have a thing with you and I where I would put it up against anybody and yet you know the things happened and I don't want to go down that road cuz actually you don't feel really good about everything but she should I just it's like man it just you only get these things so many times in life will be professionally especially the kind of stuff that we do where you're like it's actually like for all the topics all these different ways to bring a different actually work so yeah I really wish about whatever I mean never has a long time so I'm not going to say that the hardest thing to do right now to do in this business this fractured environment long ago some of the stuff I want those folks and I'll be I'll be pulling for you enjoying all the content that you produce and just try to figure something out so it's not really good by a different address my man I hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I did about that one also make sure you check out the place and the guys crushing it with all the GM and everybody from around the league and Zach Lowe Lowe post podcast as well I'll do it
