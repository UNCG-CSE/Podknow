What episode of Seinfeld has is brought to you by Starbucks Nitro cold brew Nitro cold brew in fuses nitrogen microbubbles into cold brew coffee making a smooth and velvety drink Cream Sweet available at Starbucks hi I'm Wendy zukerman and you listening to signs veces from gimlet we are hot at work cooking up a brand new season of science vs we're really excited about it we'll be back 5G sleep and even magic mushrooms it's going to be a wild ride but in the meantime we had this wonderful episode from another part time that we really want to share with you the podcast is called some of old pots and this episode was inspired by the horse stall when is son who is obsessed with Dinosaurs don't takes it from you like a lot of three-year-olds my boyfriend is kind of in the dinosaurs like he's really into dinosaurs if you look around that place excuse the mess it's been a busy week is dinosaurs everywhere from pajamas 2T shirts to hoody's I'm super jealous of the T-Rex hoodie just quietly there's a lot of dinosaurs and who is this so many dinosaur books like this now. A block is a cartoon dinosaur catalog but don't let that fool you it's super comprehensive she'll like Spinosaurus there's all these different species of dinosaur is an anatomically accurate diagram set in an appropriate habitat this evening pronunciation got my suorin sea life I like day soft cheese free Ben and his friends can they pretty much all these dinosaurs but the thing is I kind a kid cry a lot Des heaps of dinosaurs that I just don't recognize but I've never seen before we had old favorites like T-Rex stegosaurus triceratops and Brontosaurus and I was Dino obsessed as a kid so what's going on why does my three-year-old know so much more about dinosaurs than I ever did well look for all as parents grandparents aunties uncles friends with people with kids that anyone feeling maybe just a little intimidated by a small humans encyclopedic dinosaur knowledge I'm here to get to the bottom of this question you guaranteed to hear when you put a paleontologist in a room full of school kids now there's always at least one kid who asked me what my favorite dinosaur is Steve do you know I grew up around the same time and like him I agree it's got to be T-Rex in a product of that generation it's just fascinated with T-Rex and a lot of times these kids look at me and sometimes they even say can I say really T-Rex I mean come on and I was on that a little bit cliched and so kids now yeah they're bigger than we ever thought things like dreadnoughtus and patag I didn't have as a kid you didn't have as a kid you say Steve and I are all that particular era and when it comes to dinosaurs it kind of shows it's not so much that kids these days know more than we do. It's just that there's so much more to know over the past couple of decades does being an explosion in the discovery of new dinosaur species and I'm a independent paleontologist or Rogue scientist Jones Ph.D put numbers to this explosion in dinosaur knowledge of every single published ever discovered every sort of dinosaur species that is recorded in this database so you wanted to know how many dinosaurs have been discovered recently and when did this Dyno explosion really begin every dinosaur species and every occurrence or every individual has ever discovered that has been published associated with it okay so I wouldn't usually describe a graph on the show but the graphs that John produced based on his analyses elegant so here we go imagine to access a side to side or horizontal lines across is an up-down of vertical line along the horizontal line a Year's starting way back before 1850 over on the left and running right up to the present to the 2000s on the right on the vertical axis is What's called the cumulative number of new fossil discoveries what that actually means is that as new discoveries made the allocated a date there signed a year on the horizontal axis and overtime As you move from one year to the next new discoveries added to all discovery so the line that's produced represents the increase in fossil discoveries overtime starting way over on the left back before I turn 50, just bubbles alone increasing from dieting 50 through the 90s to the 1950s 60s 70s 80s just a slight shallow gradual increase a line that slowly almost imperceptibly building but then around the 1990s something strange happened and we see this this huge explosive growth in the number of discoveries being made and being published g2000 the trend Sheetz the black line suddenly gets the wastepaper it stops bubbling and just schutz skywards like the neck of a Brachiosaurus if you familiar with the idea of an exponential curve where things grow more and more quickly over time that's what this looks like from the late 1990s this being a massive unprecedented increase in the number of new dinosaur discoveries so what happened in the late nineties to cause this rapid and massive increase in the number of new dinosaur discoveries don't seriously the paleontologist if I spoke to they all told me where they got in their King Kong Jurassic Park was a big deal in the mid-1990s there was a certain film published that was a big thing for the field that's paleontologist Steve frassati again a little over twenty-five years ago the bat film came out and that changed everything that really did it really did it brought dinosaurs into pop culture in a way they never been before and because of the public interest there was a result in Publix way you can meet people all over the world I have colleagues all over the world people that are real roughly my age of the generation of paleontologist in their their 30s that say Jurassic Park is what got turn into dinosaurs and it's not just kids like me growing up in the US it's people all over the world and I have colleagues from China from South America that say Jurassic Park. Me into dinosaurs that is wonderful I just think that's a magical thing that a film a piece of entertainment have that much impact on science but according to Steve it's not just Jeff Goldblum we have to thank for all the cool new dinosaur as a way of finding another big reason for the dyno explosion is because new countries busting with fossils has started investing in dino hunting it used to be really a game that was just played by a few partial professors and a few universities in a few places in Europe and North America mostly so you know what you think about the most well-known love dinosaurs things like Tyrannosaurus rex or Triceratops and these are not the case anymore the field is growing its diversifying there are paleontologists particularly young paleontologist all over the world people in China and Brazil and Argentina and he's enormous developing countries that are full of Wide Open Spaces full of rocks bursting with dinosaur bones China in particular has become a cool dinosaurs and what's been so amazing about all these new discoveries is that they changing a lot of our ideas about dinosaurs episode of Bonanza effect in China and around Adrian particular where once only thing discovered people will go there and they want to discover more and more and more and all of a sudden they had these shoes dicks is being revealed and particularly hungry all the time on the land and there were these crazy new discoveries that completely shut up you know our understanding of dinosaurs and it's exciting to watch after the break we're getting up close and personal with a new dinosaur discovery and let me tell you it's going to give T-Rex a run for its money is episode of science vs is brought to you by Starbucks Nitro cold brew Starbucks Nitro cold brew which is already settled velvety-smooth everyone's favorite element on the periodic table and it just so happens that I know who used to work in a real science lab to tell us about some of the other uses of nitrogen well in Labs we use liquid nitrogen all the time so cool stuff down really rapidly and it's one of the perks of being a scientist that makes you feel especially scientist because you like open up this batch and there is all of this like cold Vapor bad be as impressed with Starbucks Nitro cold brew it's kind of reminds me of like having a cappuccino but there's no actual milk in it now we can get Starbucks Nitro cold brew available at select Starbucks we just had that way in the midst of a massive dinosaur Gold Rush with a new dinosaur discoveries happening way more often than I used to know that's a little things to the movie Jurassic Park but it's also because countries like China started investing more and more into paleontology when now I'm going to dive right into this gold rush to see what it's like to discover a new dinosaur story comes to us from the podcast some of old pots by Joanna he's Joel on the front lines of the global paleo Resurgence he's been involved in the discovery of a bunch of new dinosaur species but just how many his kind of too humble to say you know I don't Golden Books and things but it's somewhere around fifteen I think and it's not that I'm going out and finding 15 dinosaurs myself that's not how it works how it works is it still needs a part of a team that the song how does a new fossil or she's cold into a museum to help identify a fossil that someone else has discovered often a construction worker orapharma which was the case with one such new discovery he helped make during his time working in China I'm there to work with some colleagues I'm working with my good friends and Sean Lew want to China's leading dinosaur hunters sadly June Chong passed away a few months ago real giant in the field somebody were already missing tremendously but June Chong and I we've had a collaboration for a while and you know I'd come to China to work with him and he said we got something up in liaoning we got to go see it liaoning Province shares a border with North Korea in China's Northeast and it's a perfect example of how a place not traditionally associated with paleontology can quickly become a hotbed of discoveries discoveries to start the challenge everything we think we know about dinosaurs probably not a part of China you've heard about unless you're a paleontologist it's not the sort of place that a lot of tourists get to but this is nirvana for Dinosaur Hunters because in the mid-90s you had some locals there mostly Farmers starting to discover these amazingly preserved fossils of dinosaurs covered in feathers and it turned out there wasn't just one or two other dinosaurs but there were tons of these things and there were lots of other fossils to there were fishes or mammals mammals covered in hair there were reptiles and amphibians and there were pterodactyls ecosystems that were buried by volcanoes so these things were locked in place almost Pompeii style and so that means that people are still finding a lot of these fossils in these fossils are really important because with each new feathered dinosaur that's another clue to help us understand how Evolution took one of these meat-eating land living T-Rex toy dinosaurs and turned it to a bird so when the cold came through the defilement in liaoning had found a fossil in his failed Steve moved quickly he arranged to meet June Chang at Beijing central train station to very next morning you know that train and crawled through the rural Landscapes of China and it was early in the morning I was trying to sleep but I couldn't I was in a far too excited about what might be there when I arrived in liaoning Steve and June Chang were greeted by some local dignitaries who escorted them to a black SUV they spot us through town they took us to this building in the outskirts of town I'm really not in the script building it look just like most of the other buildings in the area but this humble looking building with the museum housing the fossil that they were there to examine you know it doesn't look like the American Museum in New York for the Australian Museum Ernie these Grand museums seems like a hospital or an office building or something in there very sterile but they let us through a hallway there were these flickering lights and they let us into this room until this small room in inside this room there was this big slab of rock that was perched on a quite small table and it really looked to me like the legs of that table or Buckley I was a little bit worried that this thing was going to fall onto the floor and so Jin Chong and I were called up and we walked up and we looked at this thing and that is you know one of awesome moments of my life where I was face-to-face with this incredible fossil clearly a dinosaur all the bones were there beautiful chocolate brown bones sticking out from this tan colored Limestone clearly a raptor sharp teeth sharp claws look so much like Velociraptor about the size of a large dog something like a Saint Bernard but covered in feathers feathers everywhere feathers on the tail feathers on the body feathers on the head feathers on the arms and not just any feathers on the arms but actual quill feathers forming wings so this was a raptor dinosaur with wings and the preservation was so gorgeous that you could see all the fine details of these feathers you can see the individual feathers you can see how they were anchored to the bones how they were overlapping each other to form the wing and this looked basically like the same sort of structure that we see in modern birds and you know it's hard to really convey and words just how magical that was to be let into this room you know after this long journey to see this object this thing sober a hundred million years old that's you like a piece of Fine Arts you know that object just conveys this powerful message that birds evolved from dinosaurs distance or turned out to be a new species a cousin of velociraptor it was cold Shin One loan with so many people realizing that they may have found some invaluable part of diner history new dinosaurs aren't necessarily ending up in museums there are folks out there in a wealthy folks that want to have a T-Rex in their living room and who doesn't want to have a T-Rex in your living room I mean I mean I don't blame people for wanting a dinosaur but it means that there is a bit of a and it's similar in some ways to the Art Market some of these amazing fossils are these unique one-of-a-kind pieces that high-end collectors really want and that breeds a black market and Steve says whenever Tycoon with a potion for dinosaurs snatches up a special fossil science gets a bum deal as a scientist I can see how every fossil is important but some fossils are really important there you need their new species it's a complete skeleton that shows details that no other fossils show those kind of fossils really do need to be in museums so they can be studied so they can be conserved so they can be made available to Future Generations So they can be put on display so they can be accessible to the public so people can see them and be inspired by them so there's one final question that I've got to ask Don explosion ever end or could the Brontosaurus Bonanza just keep going forever I think we're just getting started and I tell the stall young kids you know what I do talks I say people are finding more dinosaurs than ever before but don't worry we're not running out of dinosaurs because as people Explore More of the earth is more people go and look for fossils the more they find we are still finding new dinosaurs all over the place and even if we stopped finding dinosaur fossils today the rest of science is going to keep moving on and there's going to be a new techniques new technologies new types of experiments and instruments and ways of thinking that will help us study the dinosaurs we already have in ways we never would have thought possible so who knows what's going to be found next or who's going to find it And hoisted by Joanna Jonathan Webb is there signs and sound design by Joanna and marked on additional fact-checking by Lexi crop and additional music and Engineering bipedal in it in some of old pause he's one of our favorite podcasts you really should check it out some of all parts is a
