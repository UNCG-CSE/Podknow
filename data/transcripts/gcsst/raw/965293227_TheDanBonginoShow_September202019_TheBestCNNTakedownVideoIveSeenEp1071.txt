Intel leak out there that Donald Trump made a promise to a foreign government on the phone that was so devastating that a whistleblower had to come forward to expose it because the United States the very security of the country was at risk I got to be candid with you folks I'm even I was a little worried about this one right now Paul I said the ball on this one sounds a little weird that I started to think this through and I heard a Ari Fleischer former Bush George W bush press secretary made a great point I should have considered especially having been inside the White House and I'm not above being self-deprecating I should I'm not saying I fell for this fake news but even I was a little curious about what it was about so again the Genesis is an Intel Community whistleblower heard or read something about Donald Trump conversation with a foreign government that was so troubling that it required a an Intel an IG investigation okay when the president United States is on a phone call play foreign leader ladies and gentlemen there are multiple people listening and I know that I was yummy too hard to figure out should have been more Savvy year Play Store brought up a great point if this thing was so troubling this phone call This Promise he made before and govern why did only one person find it troubling and everyone else I was just this one person by the way yeah I have a good idea of who this whistleblower are quotes is I'm hesitant to say it as of yet but I think a lot of people have the identity wrong based on the pronouns are using I'll leave it at that I can't said because we have a wide we listen to show because it would be ethically inappropriate till I can absolutely confirm it but I have a good idea who it is and I think a lot of people don't and I can tell they don't again based on the pronouns they're using to describe the Whistleblower I don't have to I don't have a clue now yeah I'm going to wait for it because I don't I don't I don't do it liberal media people doing jump out in front of a story ladies and gentlemen now it's become clear what's really going on at least yesterday in the Washington Post and elsewhere that this far and government call with a leader was with the IV Ukrainian leader the incoming Ukrainian president and that the promise may have had something to do with investigations into Ukrainian corruption with the Obama castration Spygate at a promise that was made by Trump I guess in exchange for that investigation now it all makes sense ding ding ding ding ding ding Bells went off all around now in order to explain this a little bit better and maybe a little confusing what's going on I'm going to play For You Some Cuts first and I'm going to try it again of Rudy giuliani's terrific appearance last night by Chris Cuomo's Dreadful CNN show which has about 10 viewers but Rudy's on and first I'm going to play at three cuts from this the first ones are important because it's a liberal activist Chris Cuomo's effort to member framing you know what framing is right it's when you tell a story but you tell the story in a context favorable to what you want the narrative to be so Nick Chris Cuomo before you watch this opening here to Giuliani Giuliani call Tim at right away once the story frame as if Trump is colluding with the ukrainians to damage his political opponent that's not what's happening Trump is trying to uncover Ukrainian corruption but that's not out, frames it and listen to Giuliani cut that nonsense right out check this out there is now breaking news on that urgent complain about President Trump it involves Ukraine this comes from the Washington Post you might remember house Democrats have been examining whether the president and his attorney Rudy Giuliani sought to manipulate the Ukrainian government into helping the Trump re-election campaign they were doing that before this complaint that something that may seem confusing as you go through the fax tonight is that the subject phone call that we now know took place in this time frame that people are looking at when this complaint came in who did the president speak to who was a leader at that time he spoke to the president of Ukraine now that call was already the subject of curiosity by Congress cuz they were looking into these earlier efforts import announced by mr. Giuliani about his intentions of trying to get to Ukraine to figure out some things about some of mr. Trump's political opponents so that's where it stands we happen to have the man in the middle tonight the president's counselor former mayor Rudy Giuliani good to have you on the show I'm glad I'm on tonight because what you just said is totally erroneous every single thing you just said is completely spun by the way I'm sorry apology survive to be I got so excited about this story how are you today very sorry I did not do the adjust welcome to the Dan bongino show how are you on this Friday cool dude it's Friday I knew you I know you were all fired up I knew you forgot it and go out excited about this story choose not to because really the show is different we don't have a producer and I love Joe and an enzyme Paula and everything about this but I'm really so stoked I wanted to get right into it that we have to pay for the show with sponsors and book signing my sincere apologies just because you what you said is entirely a rodian you just made up the whole thing right up the road and erroneous what hotel is channeling Vince Vaughn just wonderful stuff now because Chris Cuomo lives in the Echo chamber of what is acceptable public thought amongst liberals academics at Hollywood elitists it otherwise people who hate Trump they're not interested in the truth are interested in telling you a story not the story now this story here and I'll show you some cuts of biting if you had to tell you what's really going on is Donald Trump is and his administration are deeply concerned about credible serious in many cases overwhelming evidence of Ukrainian foreign government collusion with the Obama Administration did damage the Trump campaign and Joe Biden's problems with the Ukrainian government when it comes to him pressuring them to fire a prosecutor who is looking at an operation that involved his son this is obviously heating up why because right is it cheating up we have these media League show from a whistleblower dreaded are quote that all of a sudden say Trump was talking to Ukraine and this is really suspicious these promises let's focus on that left is in trouble when the media starts leaking search remember this is a better way to explain it back tip to the Magnificent Tucker Carlson last night who always puts things more eloquently than I can this show is intentionally a little more Rough Around the Edges Tucker said last night the left Spike feigned virtue always covers the sin show the flap and the media that virtue here we are very concerned about Trump colluding with the ukrainians on a phone call you listen to talk over the way he beautifully stated last sigh The Virtue covers the scent what is the sin the sin is that the real Ukrainian collusion that they're trying to cover is the Obama Biden collusion with you crazy that they need to go away so they portrayed virtue and pinning it on truck yeah there's no question the left colluded with the Russians in conjunction with the meeting no question anymore I discuss it in my book on living a life liberty and Levin it said I'm telling you the best interview I've ever done this I can't say this enough on Sunday night at 10 it is succinctly stated in a way you haven't heard it before the left colluded with the Russians with the media so what are they do the virtue covers the sin they blame it on Trump look we're being virtuous we're uncovering Russian collusion right now this is what's happening again Como this is important I don't mean to be this is about it but if you don't understand the framing that Giuliani Nails them on you don't understand the story Cuomo is telling you a story it's just not the story now move on what is this really about the ukrainians in conjunction with the Obama Administration I detail this is my new book is honor rated but the ukrainians working with DNC operative Nellie Ohr who's already admitted to getting information from key ukrainians right now you are from Fusion GPS and sores wife work they were intimately but they've already admitted on the record getting information from ukrainians about the Trump team what we would call Joe what would we call that far and collusion now that's right manafort has been prosecuted based on information that came to the US government about this Blackledge what was the black Legend this is going to go to hear a lot about this soon the black Ledger was an allegation that manafort had been paid millions of dollars in illicit cash payments in a conjunction for some work with this foreign government that he didn't report but you're the only evidence we have of these cash payments not have payments payments from a foreign government or an illegal they're not people to pay my phone coverage for all kind of thing, lobbying is not illegal towing a vehicle in violation of us what listen you're only going to get this here there's no one else has the time explain in detail the allegations that they were cash payments to avoid taxes and other things to manifold only exist in this document known as the black Ledger that was given to us by ukrainians what's the problem Joe the black Ledger is a hoax now that you understand that that a hoax document was given to us by ukrainians colluding with Democrat to nail manafort to the wall as soon as he was brought in the Trump team now the second segment would really Rudy and Cuomo will make more sense play let me tell you what happened okay yes what what happened is that I was investigating going back to last year complaints that the Ukrainian people several people in Ukraine knew about a tremendous amount of collusion between Ukrainian officials and Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee including a completely fraudulent document that was produced in order to begin the investigation of manafort yes now you see how I'm sorry I have to like what these provisos and caveat to explain her to the beginning but that video makes no sense if you don't understand what I just told you need to show fake Ledger should the setup is Keith's a fake ledger so we paid metaphor 12 million in cash was given to our law enforcement in Intel and political people in the United States and was used as the spark to start an investigative flame to take manafort down only because manafort at join the Trump team the problem is the document was fake now Chris Cuomo's not interested in that Chris Cuomo's framing this as well this is the disgusting horrible abusive tactics of the mainstream media in their efforts to lie to you and distract you from what's really going on Cuomo does not want you to pay attention to the fact that the Obama Administration and it's investigation gets mad for on a fake document from a foreign government the definition of collusion he needs you to stay focused on the fact that Rudy Giuliani is Trump's lawyer may have expressed an interest in this case and exposing the corruption that's not the story Cuomo need you to hear he wants you to hear about promises and foreign government conversation between Trump in the Ukraine and how do you see how devious this has just let me sum this up for you, with such a hack that rather than focusing on hard evidence of a massive for inclusion Scandal based on false documents to spy on the Trump he's turning and flipping the whole thing around to make the effort to expose it by Rudy make that the Scandal you got it you guys are going over there and try to pressure trying to pressure anybody trying to get the truth Giuliani stop making this up now I want you to pay special attention of a short clip here's the third and find this one on its a 7-minute cut your free to watch it I rarely promote CNN unless they're being absurd but Disturbed cut is important because Rudy here's to set up Rudy describes at in the process of investigating the black Ledger death hoax black Ledger about the cash payments they found other stuff that if your regular listen to the show about Joe Biden you already know about by the way that is covered again I'm I'm not I hate to bug sorry I don't wanna from Otis to death I buy really folks that means a lot to me this is a this interview tonight about 10 p.m. I'm sorry on Sunday night with Mark when was stumbling over my words cuz I feel so passionately bad you cannot mrs. I discussed this at the end in the process of Giuliani investigating this he discovers information about by it's in my book exonerate that is deeply troubling yeah you had already knows made money just check this out this is worth your time I found out this incredible story about Joe Biden that he bribed the present of the Ukraine in order to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son that is an astounding Scandal of major proportions which all of you with covered up for about five or six months so ladies and Gentlemen Just to be clear what just happened on CNN last night giuliani's investigating a major major foreign collusion Scandal about a hoax document used to investigate Trump's campaign manager manafort in the process of investigating Scandal number one will be in the process of investigating Scandal as Trump's attorney trying to uncover massive malfeasance and covers another Scandal about Obama's vice president the time by basically bribing a foreign government to fire a prosecutor in Ukraine who is looking into potential malfeasance involving biting skin you may said come on Dan that can't possibly have happened really let's play this little cunt here is Joe Biden when he was talking about his experience in Ukraine actually bragging about this this disgusting episode where he he threatens the government of Ukraine to withhold money if they don't fire the investigator who is patch this is a fact it's an opinion who is looking at his kid for potential malfeasance Hunter bike here is the actual video tape of Biden this this dope bragging about a check this out it's not over by the Guess the 12th 13th time to Kiev and and I was going to supposed to announce that there was another billion dollar loan guarantee and I had gotten a commitment from for a shanko and from yachts in Europe that they would take action against the state prosecutor and they did so they said they had it they walk out the press, and I said I'm not going to go or we're not going to give you the billion dollars they said you have no Authority or not the present the presents that I should call him I said you're not getting the billion I would be leaving here I think it was about six hours I look at them later than 6 hours at the prosecutor's not fired you're not getting the money mo son of a bitch and they put in place someone who was solid at the time again Chris Cuomo this total Hackett CNN has zero zero interest in that story that is Joe Biden literally literally not figuratively on tape bragging about firing a prosecutor who is investigating an operation that involves his son Hunter you can spend that all you want the price I've heard, less I get enough time to play the whole interview by quavo. Well that prosecutor may have been corrupt anyway even if you take got a fat Joe and asking you to be an independent Arbiter for a second try to think like a liberal I'm not joking if that's your explanation Chris Cuomo your comeback is well the prosecutor in Ukraine Biden once fired for investigate his kid was corrupt anyway I'm asking you want to see obviously knows his son is heavily involved and potential malfeasance in Ukraine it's his kid he knows that and then what's going on he knows his son's being investigated don't you think it would be proper even if I die. This guy was crap to recuse himself from that decision I would think so yeah you think I'm not a trick I'm of course and what I find on this is why Como such a hack the same Network CNN and the same clown show over there that'll insist Donald Trump should have recused himself from a Moscow building project that never happened that he was only remotely involved with that the end was not illegal in any way anyway Donald Trump to build in Moscow or whatever he wants as long as he abides by local on there's no allegation Donald Trump Trump Tower Moscow project that never happened is it Anyway illegal how lunatic liberals in the media there and they're sick deranged radical friends yes I said it you are doormat these lunatics will it says Trump should have recused himself from that Moscow Mule but never happened and yet Joe Biden on tape admits to pressuring a government to fire a prosecutor for best get his kids there's no story there that Biden should recuse himself AC no impropriety whatsoever Move Along thank you Joe nothing to see here folks what total BS, what is an embarrassment and but folks again I can't play the Holy Rood Eagles on later on at the end of it totally dismantle this guy I need all the Liberals like him as a Rudy meltdown it was one of the finest media appearances I have ever seen Giuliani tells him at the end you're a sellout and I'm telling you Chris you are a seller you are a total I didn't jump on your back when you had the whole incident where you threaten to throw a guy down the stairs you know how we talked with him but I didn't jump on the outrage Brigade on that but last night you humiliated yourself Rudy Giuliani came on your show with a series of undeniable facts about unquestioned corruption between the Obama Administration by Eddie Ukrainian government a collusion Scandal on massive doses of Dianabol what did you do you spent the whole time covering it up and trying to distract people acting like giuliani's allegations and giuliani's efforts to get to the truth are the real Scandal by this whistleblower media ladies and gentlemen journalism is dead you want real journalism come here and we're not even this isn't even up

happened is conservatives out there in case you are not on Twitter or Instagram or elsewhere some of you may not be and you listen to the show conservatives jail when you agree the greatest roles of the World by trolls I mean we have mastered the art of Mimi we're usually conservatives historically a little bit behind kind of the culture Tech Trends you know the Liberals are all the Apple people and you know what the Google people are usually behind the eight-ball as someone said to me one time I'd like to add color, to set it accurately they said the problem with the conservative movement is a lot of a lot of successful business people who are conservatives are based in commodity type businesses you know oil selling equities basic might as well see the real marketing because when you're selling the BP vs. Sunoco you don't be so don't go look how great is apple as a dancing with the earbuds in so the people in the tech industry or Liberals are usually more Savvy marketers than we are right that is not the case with technology I'm telling you I'm on Twitter all day Facebook Instagram all of it I live on there because that is where the debate is happening conservatives have mastered the art of hijacking liberal efforts to turn Twitter into a liberal Cesspool they have we hijack everything hashtag means and we hijack climate change pal here are some of the climate change confessions ladies and gentlemen if you see these for the first time I assure you these are hilarious here's conservative Charlie Hughes number one climate change confession I eat every day and I won't stop because it's good that's under the meat category I require at least 85 in the winter and 55 in the summer deal with it hippies I cook a 1lb steak every day he half and throw the pass away in a reusable ziplock bag for there's a lot of Transportation who cares I'll do what I like I floor it in my gas-guzzling sports car just for fun you do not matter to me I'd like to recycle more especially since I drink bottles of water a weak spot the recycling truck comes on the day I sleep if I can take it up there jokes I lives and laugh a little Mike would be peace people like kid it's a troll thing you know I love the environment that affect Paul and I have this thing about this plastic in the ocean since I'm serious it drives me crazy that serious but you do have to admire the conservative nicely that you are so the fact that we have beat the Liberals to the punch and managed to hijack everything in the tech space now online Blog Twitter hashtags Instagram meme I just love you all we have become the new Renegade conservatives Libertarians are good Republicans are the new cultural Renegade that I have to tell you by the way they're all over Twitter those things I just pick 6 of the funniest ones they are taught there tons of them out there and on a Friday I just want to get that the butt used to take away cuz you know it's not a comedy show you take away that was a serious one member in the past when I told you based on our big business support and commodities type Industries we've never been really good at this and things are starting to change I think a lot of younger folks are in the counterculture developing and we're getting a lot better at doing this stuff so nice job very very funny stuff it was great okay but it's important give a 2020 election around the corner and I think we need to start talking about things it'll benefit and potentially hurt Donald Trump listen this is a obviously AA is a Maga show I want to make America great again I support the present cuz I think he's got a really good conservative job on that when they're a couple things I think we need to kind of Polk and prod them in a different direction on sometimes when they're getting bad advice fair enough. Meant To Be a Jerk thing it's meant to be we have a voice and sometimes you're the voice needs to be heard a positive story first out here this was Donald Trump the other day over seeing some new border wall construction and he did an impromptu press Avail and this is Donald Trump doing something I'm not kidding I'm not being sarcastic masterful that if anybody the administration is listening he needs to do more of this Donald Trump talking about construction is an absolute Grand Slam home run enough teasing I want to play this cut and we'll put a little color commentary on the back and we come back check this out I wanted them to show you the interior of parts of the wall and what's inside of each individual slat and you'll see it's a combination of steel concrete and as one of the folks just said it really is virtually impenetrable any walls that were put up with get knocked down very quickly very easily this wall is not something that can be really knocked down I guess anything's can but it's very tough and it goes down 60 it's 3 and 4 feet wide the concrete you see it right here it's exposed masterful I'm not kidding masterful this guy build stuff these media lunatics covering, these media lunatics coverage I've never built anything in their lives these are twenty-two-year-old journalism graduates you know from the East tuna fish School of Journalism who have never built a Lego set their entire lives they don't know anything they have no practical real-world hands-on experience constructing anything material in their entire lives by the way that clip goes on in the interest of time I just wanted to get to you I wanted to make sure I got that clip goes on Jose heard all day to talk about grades of concrete how the rebar works this guy's build stuff for decades are fine you don't like this tweet you don't like his personality this guy has generated billions and billions and billions of dollars in real estate and Construction in jobs in wealth and housing he is done something and to the people in the white house I hope you're listening do you need to have him do more of this everywhere there's local and state projects it doesn't matter if it's a federal project I hope it's not there's a local project building a new housing facility for for illegal immigrants he needs to get out there and explain what they're doing this is what he does temperature how at home did he look there construction he understands them I just know that from a practical perspective nobody can explain this better than he can what a joke what did you said you got the same thing for me so I get a new what he was looking at he was doing that impromptu he understood all of it and I think to it like brass here's a guy that knows what we do here is a guy that knows what goes into this stuff sure helps a lot that's what I was trying to say that's why I that's what I'm working people are listening to build stuff that's instruction were laborers Tradesman skilled workers office Carpenters that you know steelworkers electricians in there like yeah that's my language that's how I talk I don't fucking I talk like that is the pronoun show yesterday I got an email from people who work for me like I don't know.

Sera it will not do anything so you have to ask yourself why are they doing it as I explained earlier in the week they're doing it for one simple reason they want a gun registry for people like Beto O'Rourke in the future to come and confiscate your gun so they have a handy dandy list that is the only reason please mr.

Secondly capitalism advice free markets and individual control of those exact same components of the economy in the political system okay now having said that saying that the Scandinavian countries are socialist is a lie Bayern it is just not true so if you're going to argue for socialism then you need to argue about Cuba Venezuela and the Soviet Union I want to be clear on this matter again this is the same liberal take over the language we show we saw it with G Shou Joe day which is we were not going to let you do it now proving my point I pulled two articles ones older ones relatively new from the mises flying in from a local paper this is from The mises Institute 3534 2019 by Alice sells Swedish ex-prime Minister rebukes Bernie socialism only destroyed now this will be up in the show notes today bongino.com subscribe to my email is Sallie Mae these articles this is worth your time if Sweden is your idea of a socialist Utopia then why is the former prime minister of Sweden condemning socialism and telling Bernie Sanders to go shove it up his Caboose that they are not socialist it's not a socialist country so you suggesting we want to be a Sweden socialist you are making it your judgments are based on faulty data do you understand that you may want to be like Sweden but that doesn't mean you want to be socialists that means you want to be be Capital it you're in the wrong box they are not socialist it is a capitalist country now check if this is a bit of an older piece but still worth your time alright Joe we don't want to be like Sweden I want to be like Denmark stand mixers return Danish Prime Minister and he was in the United States and said quote Denmark is not socialist November 1st 2015 post this is not a socialist country either it is a market economy now their prime minister later on Lars Rasmussen during the election stated it again he rebuked Bernie Sanders they are not a socialist country you are fabricating the information if you were going to argue for us becoming socialist fine make us make a case that we should be like the Soviet Union Cuba and Venezuela make your carrier going to be laughed at mocking humiliated but make your taste but don't be a liar don't suggest we should be putting the Socialist box and say we need to be more like Sweden and Denmark these are capitalist countries don't you think the people that live there and run the country would know just a little bit better than a 19 year old college kid in a man on the street interview we think so I wonder can I go to let us remember she's letting us about this story I don't want to make sure I covered it before the way I don't want to leave you with misinformation tell us a story that broke again the media wants to tell you a story not the story story broke. Cult called the gun manufacturer of course the media story meant to spend you and is being used by liberals now to attack you is basically saying look even the gun manufacturers Joe are producing AR-15s anymore. True story and ask her if you in the show no se by Charles Charles Koch how to bend the news screenshots from the story folk sculpt is not getting out of the AR-15 business because solve this Spate of mass shootings that is not why they're doing it but that's why the media wants to tell you a story why Joe because they want to send a wink and a nod in the Dog Whisperer other gun manufacturers that hey if you guys get out of this AR 50 business to look will celebrate you guys too and woke you want the media framing of the story in and of course we'll get to the quote from the Charles Koch PCS from ABC is a nice example of news organizations deliberately bending the truth to advancing out if it wishes were true but it's not yours ABC venerable gun manufacturer Colt since it will stop producing the AR-15 amongst other rifles for the consumer Market in the wake of many recent mass shootings in which the suspect use the weapon okay you want ABCs of news outlets are clearly to tell him the truth that in the wake of suggesting Joe a correlation between these recent horrible incidents an AR-15 and called and called the decision again always show me the fortune that's not the truth as always wrong that's not the story at all as ABC notes further down remember Joe the Jets are the company did not mention mass shootings in a statement about stopping production step blame the indefinite pause pause and stop behaving and making the weapon on a significant excess manufacturing capacity in other words Joe basic economics of supply and demand are already a lot of AR-15s on the market and they don't see any money in producing more until the supplies somewhat exhausted basically business decision 101 but of course the media no one in the media I've seen outside of foxes told you the true story of it it was a big story cult or not if we can. You all should do that to their not pulling out of the a arm has just too many of them out there to basic business decision stop lying my gosh here's another media story showing a double standards a quick one but worth your time the conspiracy theory Blog The Daily Beast go if they were reporting on a Republican or a conservative darkening their face with black makeup what would it be called so it would be call blackface now I made it would be called a major Scandal black face darkening your skin to make you appear black but that's not what they call it when it involves liberal Canadian Prime Minister in the love of The Daily Beast conspiracies dogs conspiracy Plaza third instance of Justice Justin Trudeau in face darkening makeup at its face darkening makeup when it's 11 but if this was a republican it would be evil Republican in blackface listen this is a total joke I was on Hannity last night and I brought up the fact that and I'll see who it is cuz that you know I'm not interested I'm not attacking and personally I'm just putting on what he said I think it's absurd Juan Williams was on the five yesterday and I mention it last night I said a Fox News got him want to call him out and he shall find him cuz he didn't have a chance to defend himself and Unlike liberals I believe in at 2 a.m. no dialogue not just you know liberal screaming at everyone but one Williams on the five yesterday but I'm suggesting the rules are different if it was a conservative hippie blackface Scandal fire him it's a liberal face darkening makeup incident let him go he's real cool right that's so why is it on the five years or something so outrageous I I felt the need to say someone out of you last night he said that the rules are different for conservatives and liberals because Republicans have a troubled history with race this is a dumb penalty that it's a review of the penalty again are you kidding me Republicans we have a trouble history race you mean the Civil Rights party the party of Lincoln the party that led the civil rights movement in the South against the dixiecrat Democrat you mean those are you mean the Republicans that has the South became more recently liberated diverse and an integrative Society became more not less or republican you mean that sound is that why we haven't troubled history right now are you serious yeah everything at your bird scream like I wish I was on the five I would have lost my marbles over that once you want to see a meltdown are you kidding the Republican Party Tire Jim Crow South was Democrat are you nuts the folks I don't bring that up on the Shelf because we live today and I don't think I should take credit for the actions of other people going to or bad that may not sound right but it's true I take what I do to advance civil rights for everybody Joe I'm responsible for that and that is my job to do the right thing by people and it sure everybody's big are god-given rights protected I can't take credit for Republicans at March that I wasn't there it wasn't a decision I made however I'm very proud of the fact that the party I I lie with was involved in that but I can't take credit for it that's why I don't bring it up off it I don't madrag mention that maybe a handful of times Republican party history because that's what we do now that matters at the party turned into a bunch of racists tomorrow none of that matters none of it we live in the now I'm not a big Eckhart Tolle fair but the Power of Now is really you only live in the now but if you're going to DARE bring up a history lesson and somehow say the rules now for what we didn't do now should be influenced by history then you better damn well be prepared to get your Caboose home on the carpet at the answer questions about the Dixiecrats the Jim Crow South and the Democrats almost unending history with institutional de facto and de jure racism in the South and elsewhere in the country you brought it up not us I would have lost my last job if I was on the five when that happened you dare to bring up the hit weed the Republican party has to apologize for its history on race and therefore deserves a different set of rules you must be kidding you must be a next time I'm on I'll happily debate you about the 10th of any Fox producers and see if you want to bring bring me and why not I'm happy to debate this the South became very diverse and accepting of people as it became more Republican and less Democrat kind of defeats your whole argument done it all right I'm going to admit a segment I don't usually do and listener listener email I don't worry I'm by the way just a couple rules about listen to me unless you specifically State you feel free to use my name I will never use ever second if you don't want your email on the air and I want to expose you unless your dad a mean exposing a bad way just say in the beginning do not put this on here but I got an email from a will call him an anema said it was hysterical and it proves my point about G JoJo they have a left wants to own the language and the pronoun game as a way to paint you as some kind of a nice the phobic phobophobia and the email prove my point was a great emailed the guy love the segment and he said it's just a little sip and it doesn't identify man anyway don't work I Dan I feel very inspired to a buy a discussion of pronouns you got to finally broach the real meaning of I thought this man capsule I'll get to that the second he spelled in c a b i s o l I am however very concerned about the spelling okay so if you get the joke some of you are our diehards probably get the joke I screw this up I'm not messing around I read this to pull out Mike Dupree I know what Friday is a great time at the glasses how liberals want to call glasses for us and we made the joke but I had no idea what a camisole was cuz it wasn't a cab assault as I read it the second or third time Joe he was talking about the cup Bissell Bissell which means you won't know what the whistle is when someone says go get the whistle and they call it a compass so you won't know what to do proving my point the guys felt Abyssal capsule and I had no idea it was talking about the whistle proving my point that she will lead to a total Tower of Babel break down where nobody in society will be able to communicate about the kappas or capasso Frosty bossie glasses it was beautiful you know who you are thank you for your email it was really funny we read them and it just proved my point. Nobody will have anything he was trying to communicate to me that my segment about calling a whistle like a pistol was funny and even I didn't know what he was talking about because it was spelled camisole step nice work daddy Au Gres email I land without of the week maybe we'll start doing some more of that but just remember if you want if you don't want it on the air please specify that in the subject line and don't worry I'll never mention your name but I thank you Captain caps all great job please go order my book if you order it now it'll be at your house on the pub date this Tuesday to publication date exonerated I have this book signings coming up it'll be up at the website bongino.com I'll be treating them out I'll be putting them up on Facebook I have 3 in Florida one in Huntington New York on Tuesday night an online book signing Monday at 10 p.m. for anyone around the world wants to sign copy we sold out last time in like 20 minutes so jump on that lives sign and just click the link all the information be up at 5 juno.com thanks for another great weekend shows I will see you all on Monday iTunes or SoundCloud and follow Dan on Twitter 24/7 at d bongino
