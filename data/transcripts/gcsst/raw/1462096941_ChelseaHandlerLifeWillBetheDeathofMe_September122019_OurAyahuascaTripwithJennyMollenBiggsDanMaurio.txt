Ways and decided that we were like never gets me to get three of us were never going to be in the same place apartment and not even bother to hang out with me while that was happening was she in the city and then my house in Spain where I also didn't see her I think that's how she rolls I think she just wants to cut my pass like ships in the night so make you think you're still in a friendship but never actually seeing each other which is what's happening right now because you're you're in New York and we're in La so we're talking about Ayahuasca today and I think it's a good time to check in how many years has it been since our experience together has it been raining for I think it's been longer than more cuz I do that. I've done it since you guys I think we all had an impact on all three of uslet's talk about how long each person's trip was because mine the first night was kind of interrupted by that you guys which I was happy to to have it and dropped it but you guys would you say it was like an hour or two hours I feel like when I settled in it took about 15 minutes for it to begin and that the trip itself was a few minutes only know it wasn't a few minutes like whoa you're laying there for much longer than that but I can't even lying there please line therefore for maybe 20 you're probably lying there for 30 minutes or laying there and yeah I think there was only this story that I told less than 5 minutes that's interesting I don't think it lasted a lifetime and yet in real time it was probably I would say an hour and a half2 hours now does that is start to finish is that you drinking the cup of whatever you drank the sickness and Danny was like 2 minutes and and he's so thin that his body just like it took over and almost died almost discombobulated right there in front of us that's what I'm scared of discombobulated yeah sorry. You're right I stand corrected least I'm not laying bricks over there while I'm lying down so you feel normal again yeah you feel enlightened but you feel completely sober and you also the great thing as you remember everything and we still remember everything I remember the scenes and it's not like a drug were sometimes blurry or alcohol which can you know make you. Remember this turn remember everything which is an advantage and that's why I think it can be so therapeutic because you are remembering everything and there's no zero come down it's not like that so it almost felt like I have never been hypnotized but you know you see people and you know the whoever it is snap their fingers and the person is fine if that's what it felt like when he said the trips over I looked I turned it all seems like I guess it's over it didn't take anything it's a really weird feature of a drug that you're if mushrooms is like augmented reality Ayahuasca is like virtual reality and you're in total control it's like you're immersed in something of physiological other than being sick to your stomach in the forest there's nothing like physiologically going on right you can just after you've laid down and you're meditating at your focus is a big part of it having you mean after you lay down cuz you're not a chicken are you do lay eggs why don't you tell us a little bit about your experience then and how you look at it now so when you asked me to do it I was in the middle of finishing my book that was sort of about my journey through motherhood and I felt like avocados a perfect opportunity to chase a story to try something that is a little maybe outside of the box but I don't know why I had spoken my therapist and she's like I think it would be good for you you're struggling with figuring out who you are as a mother and and your new identity and maybe Ayahuasca is actually a good idea so went when I ran up has Jason and first she flipped out but then eventually like all of my you know crazy hair braid ideas I got him on board and yeah it was scary that night was the terrifying will in the jungle Days of our surroundings were scary also like we were in is in a large and large is a general term for where we stayed it was more like I Hut that serve food and we were in a really dark and you know that there are lots of Critters and snakes in Peru on the Amazon we were right off of the Amazon so it was a scared and then we had to walk up to that tented therapy room or Journey room or whatever the hell they called it what did they call that go to remember does no no it was some sort of like your toilets but you know toilet seven you guys found the toilets I didn't likely never had to go there quite a lot of time in the toilet what was your overwhelming feeling how would you describe it was passing around the cup in the first I was like oh dude you're giving me way too much I mean like this is too I think I'm going to have to intense of a trip if I drink this whole cup but you know he went the shaman was somebody that we couldn't really communicate so I guess I just sort of went with it and luckily damn ended up kind of going into like a deeper more like gnarly kind of dark place than I did at first it was like that feeling like you're on ecstasy mixed with like maybe you're a little buzzed so you feel very dizzy and then all of a sudden I found myself in my childhood home of house that I I didn't even know I remembered I mean this was like lifetimes ago it feels like and I started to sort of having these experiences that I guess I had lived before but just in a different way and it almost felt like I was on like a Spotify account where I can Play click to change the image or click click through songs so I can like change the image so if I didn't love whatever I was feeling I felt in control enough to be able to kind of like flip over to a different vision and then I saw students at the times it wasn't speaking so Sid was probably not a year old or our had just turned a year but in my vision he was speaking to me and I and I sort of got this piece that I needed where he looked at me and he's like you're already enough like you don't have to prove to me that you are good enough to be my mom you already are just by being my mom you are enough for me and that is what like just sent me into hysterics oh my God yeah I couldn't handle it I thought and my daughter recently died so why you not going into what I was expecting oh my God I'm going to have this like huge traumatic encounter with the you know the ghost of my dog has nothing about my dog was all about my childhood and it really came full circle with with seeing my son wonder if I did it now if Bert would come to me in a vision and say I don't know yeah I probably would but then Jason came into it right season wasn't as big of a part no but I did love in your book when you're lying I think Jenny was terrified because she realized how much she loves her husband what you did because remember you came out of it you like I have to call Jason have to call Jason I'm like are you going to tell him everything you felt like definitely not know definitely no way he can never know it would give him too much of an upper hand in our marriage yeah I know now of course don't tell him and then he doesn't need to know exactly what it was super I opening and I felt like I was a different person afterwards I mean I know that sounds ridiculous but I did feel as though I had had 10 years of therapy or had just like up to my Zoloft to like 300 I was in a very good place and I would say that lasted for maybe it like a good year year-and-a-half and then what happened and then I descended Into Darkness again really know it's a crazy therapeutic experience and unfortunately as human beings I think it's just hard to hold on to any anything so I you know I just need to do it again is what I'm saying we've talked about doing it again are you looking into it seriously I would totally do it again I just need to make sure that with my thyroid it's okay now I have a hyperthyroid and what about your antidepressants because a lot of people say you you're not supposed to do it if you cuz didn't you go off your you didn't do it while your meds for the meds and then I recently got back on but I would if we decided to do this I would get off I mean I'm on at such a low dose that is it's not like a major deal I've only been on it for like a month we could also get a bunch of people do it and do it right here in California you know right in like 2. Right I mean I'd like to pay rent and I have a ton of friends that are always interested in do it at I'm I'm interested in doing it now that I've had therapy and I'm my head's in a different place like I now would like to see what I would get out of it cuz I bet I could go a lot deeper than I was able to them what was a compromised atmosphere I mean the light wasn't there was too much light and there was a camera crew right right right now Hannah. Disconnecting a little dog without it being documented and also and documenting it again I like to do those things on camera crew yeah I do too I do to read it would you go to work after watching it now nothing about an interest me partly because I just Dan laying on his mat I just have sex just like image that is a resonating of him being so. Z and feeling sick and I hate throwing up more than anything and him saying I would not wish this on my worst enemy is not exactly you know the act like I'm looking for when trying to drug like that's not a seal of approval for me okay and diarrhea like crazy at the diarrhea I know my pants Amazon but I probably be thin and yeah I remember gaining six or seven pounds on that trip only I can go somewhere where it to a sweat lodge have diarrhea and vomit and put on weight okay for the record Chelsea At first she walked into this journey she's like I'm not drinking I'm eating clean I'm not like all of the basically this list that she brought them things that she had to adhere to before doing the drug after I didn't work the first time she could lose in she's like eating Oreos she's like Fuck it we're okay give me a vodka I'm going to do it again I had to gated the effects of it by drinking the first night cuz I was like I'll just doesn't work I'll just have some I guess I'm going to get a buzz a different way damn let's talk about your experience in your initial reaction what you remember feeling and immediately same thing that Jenny mention with there's a sense of agency that's Bizarre by the same thing childhood home it was like I was like floating through space and then spat out into my childhood home backyard and I remember you're aware of everything as you go like Jenny was saying you have this Rich detail I remember thinking I could go and that's what the back door of my childhood home is like I don't got about this in years and I walked into my childhood home and I was like after the trailer supply in Avalon walk into my kitchen haven't thought of this and forever rich detail I'm going to go to my made a decision to go to my childhood bedroom walk down the hallway yes all my old toys shelves everything went over made a decision to go look at where my old toys were and then when I turned around it was me as a child sitting on the bed that was like the price of admission moment for are cuz there was this thing of like this is all too good to be true I think I said it I think it made the cut where I was like what this drug promises something revelatory something that will change you a little bit I said it seems too good to be true and then in my trip or whatever you want to call when I turned around and saw myself as a child I was like oh that's that's something else that's this has to be deep even if I can unpack it in the moment and then there was like a time at it and I was holding myself definitely loaded I have this phrase come to my head you are your own father you have to be a good father it was something like that which is a real kind of like that was the Deep Serta take away from the favors ass it's sort of a slow burn heavy kind of visual and phrase that were you able to change channels like yeah there was that that's sensitive I would say that's one of the defining characteristics of that drug is is you it's meditative because you're supposed to follow the shamans singing or whatever he they chanting was hard to follow that though because he was also defecating like leaves I like that part I have to say I do like getting hit with leaves ostensibly he's he's the leader but like I didn't respect him because anybody anybody who is like smoking smoking is a bad idea and like I can't like if you're going to smoke and I'm going to smoke in a rainforest that seems like a ridiculous idea okay we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back if there's something that's interfering with your happiness or that's preventing you from achieving some of your goals I want you to know that there is online counseling available for you it's called betterhelp betterhelp offers licensed professional counselors who are specialized in all sorts of issues so as we all know everybody's dealing with something so whatever your issue is I want you to know that there is an outlet for you I know everybody can't afford to go to a psychiatrist or seek professional help and their personal lives you may not have the time but everyone can go online confidential and for life will be the death of me with Chelsea Handler listeners he will get 10% off your first month with discount code Chelsea so you can get started today go to betterhelp.com Chelsea as a spectator having re-watch this last night I did not get anything from what you just said Dan like your experience it seems horrible cuz you're sitting there you just say like I'm having like deep dark thoughts like using yourself as a child that seems nice. Seems like maybe I do want to try this drug but what we saw in the edit was not that at all it was like absolutely under no circumstance would your current make someone want to try it right so what I take a turn at a certain time now I think I mean as far as the narrative goes it had to focus on Chelsea so I think I talked about my trip on camera but they probably just couldn't fit it in she had to be the focus like it was probably just funny to like put in people want to know that we want to know what I can't wait to be able to refer people that this to get the real story Chelsea said before what you just said now that you would try it again by think before you said they're not really interested in eating ass back to and luckily I didn't have to go to the bathroom and I didn't should do be but I did vomit but it was in and out like I thought you guys were in the bathroom in and out I don't know if you were vomiting or whatever get up and go and overwhelmingly sick to my stomach didn't want to throw up on camera went over to this stall in this Hut and every single inch of the surface of this bathroom toilet walls everything was covered with with bugs it was yes and I thought about like I would like Beatles song about everywhere I thought about that way home I thought about my home and like I let you know we were I was just thinking about you I was like I hate you so much like why do I let it was a I could feel it I was like all I better get out of the way he's looking straight at me with like the devil in his eyes cuz he was looking at me and I was a reflection of the devil to at that point and then I went and laid back down and then that's when my trip started was when this wave of sickness passed I could lay down and start focusing and that's when I was like I was floating through space in this trippy kind of way so it's different when you do it right away because it has to sink and I like the perspective I like having so many years to reflect upon it because it's changed over time and I definitely have to say to what you said Jenny that you thought your behavior change for about a year like it changed my relationship with my sister Shawna forever because after that I just like I had a completely different attitude towards her and her and I haven't I mean not even now to this day or maybe we just wear Martha's Vineyard a couple weeks ago and she was texting me like she can do like asking me kind of the same question over and over and we were on the phone or something I just went Shawna you seriously just stop you're annoying me and she's like I'm sorry okay and then we hung up and then I called her back I'm back I'm sorry you're not enjoying made you can keep asking me the question like I have a thing in my head now to always make sure she feels okay on my own and Ayahuasca experience so if you listen to this podcast and you don't know about it it was about a my sister and treating her fairly well the first night with you guys I didn't really get the experience because I guess I was distracted by both of you and your what was happening to you and I felt obviously responsible at about what was going down so I kind of I felt a couple tangle starting to happen in my feet when we were in that big yard in the first night and I was like okay it's happening it's happening and then you guys started moaning Bella wedding and I was like holy shit I got to get involved here so that night wasn't the night for me but the next night when I did it alone with my boyfriend the shaman who spends his nights shooting his pants in his cavaricci or true religion true religion they were jeans the next night was exactly that it was the ability to see yourself as a child outside of yourself you're watching yourself as a kid but you're not you're not the kid you're just watching and it was all scenes that were true that had happened and played out like this kind of phantasmagoria is the word I like to use cuz I think it best describes it is just like a shuffling of scenes in front of you and and it was my sister and I just left her like you know it was just laughter on the water and I could hear us you know we would tip each other over and kayaks and we'd end up I would always pee in my pants when I was a little girl and she would always let you know my brothers sisters are always add me on to do that and it was just as running down the beach holding hands and me pulling her and it was just a reminder like oh she and I are sisters we've been together longer than anyone else in my life and we held hands our entire childhood without even thinking and why am I sitting in such Judgment of her because she wants to live in New Jersey and she's perfectly content raising kids and being a housewife like I didn't write that and she and that was like there was a voice saying she is her you were you you're the one who wants the attention she doesn't want the attention there's no reason to judge her and that was like oh and then the other thing that happened right at the end because I remember feeling that and it was overwhelming and I had tears streaming down my face cuz I was like just felt so much love for her like I was like I'll be kind be gentle she's not like you and that's a good thing that's not a bad thing you know she's a different person and you have to respect that and then I was overcome with you have too many people around you all the time it's okay to be a and it's okay to spend time alone and I remember thinking fuck I don't want to deal with that like I don't want to have to ride start to do you know take a real look at myself which was probably over no bearing our overall message the deeper message there but at that moment I was like no I just got the sister message I'm going to focus on that I don't want to deal with spending more time alone or getting rid of some people in my life or whatever that meant for me at that time and I remember thinking really all I wanted to do is go downstairs and have a drink with the crew and tell them just what happened which is exactly the opposite of the voice in my head telling me to sit there and be alone and be okay with being alone and without all the activity so now I think after the last two years of all of us the book and the therapy and all of the stuff that I've learned from my psychiatrist and I think my brain is so much healthier and I'm I'm really curious now to see what would happen and I would definitely do it again so how would you guys go do it differently because there's also seen in the documentary where you're all on the porch and you're all scared like Chelsea says no I'm not scared but Jenny and Dan you were like speaking admittedly about it that you were nervous to go into it and the showing at one point said you can't go into this with fear and Chelsea you talk a lot about now accepting attention to everything like your day before you meditate whatever you do so now having done the Ayahuasca and knowing kind of the pain and physical you kind of alleviate that one aspect of it what would your intention or thought be now going into it I mean that's a good question to ask you did you feel like you prepared yourself and the right way for it well I just remember there were a lot of late dietary adjustments and I just I have starvation anxiety I feel like I couldn't do it I mean I know that you guys you guys are almost fasted that entire day maybe that is why I was like shooting my brains out for most of my trip I don't know what I can adhere to there were just so many rigid rules it was like don't have sex don't eat tomatoes don't you know what they're just like crazy yeah because I don't guess I guess it lessens the impact but I mean I would say that it didn't lessen the impact Frio actually help how would we know I made how do we know what I'm back to coming I could have been Dan I mean maybe it was a good thing I had something yeah exactly I mean they said you shouldn't drink for like 3 weeks leading up to it I think I know I didn't drink the night before like that and you weren't allowed to have certain foods because it doesn't work as well but when you look back at 8 do you think about it as a positive cuz then he's Dan came out of it and said hey I need to get back to my family my wife is pregnant what the fuck am I doing here so I think you were really mad at yourself and you were taking out your anger on me because I had given you the opportunity and you took it would you do it differently now I don't have regrets about going I it seems like a truly adventurous thing to do to go to the fucking all over this so you have to go down so I mean there was President like we had this was Brooke was pregnant with her third kid so none of them had come early before so I think I'd be more meditative going in this time I think I would be just a lot more chill and could be way less anxiety around the whole thing let me know me I notify me like a brick being like 7 or 8 months pregnant and Jenny's kid being so small said right it was said it wasn't ideal that was that was kind of shity so I think we'd be a little more clear-headed a little more of a blank slate going in where I was like I just need to do something to like you know figure out like my place in all of this and I was really looking for answers that now at least in that department I feel that I have now I think I'd be more freaked out because I think we're turning 40 I started to my new thing that I'm obsessed about in freaking out about is is dying so I think I would have differ I would actually probably just have different fears I would got to go into it a bit more like oh God is going to fuck something up in my body and my should should I really be doing this so hers about you have like Sears about not having it not an accidental sense. Not in like a 40 and also there's been some stuff that's happened in my family but it was my dad and my brother and all this shit that all of a sudden I just I don't feel so impervious I just feel vulnerable he might service always says it says to me she liked any you've always had fear before it was like that your house was haunted that you were going to get kidnapped or molested or that you know all of these things throughout the course of my life but now she says your fears are very age-appropriate you're 40 and of course now you're like my hand swollen I need an MRI what you know why is this happening why is that so I think that going into it I can't see if I'm being completely be honest I don't know that I wouldn't have fear I just think it would be different fears also I think back to Brandon's question what would your setting an attention I don't know that any of us did that after Ayahuasca set an intention and I was kind of just went and wild lay and said alright let's see what happens and now I did that drug that frog toad Venom called v d m e o t which is like a near-death experience which I didn't know that going in I was like great I wish somebody would have told me that before cuz it was miserable but that's another thing where you like it's so important to set an intention like what even when you're like kind of casually having fun with mushrooms or whatever cannabis not really you don't have to set an intention to take a nap you should start trying all day long but I think it is important to know that to go in and say okay to you I want to be present I want to have a great experience I want to learn about you know if you have a question about your career or your love life or your family something like that I think it's Sophia it's a good reminder to always just remember because it's like every morning I get up now and I meditate in bed before I do anything and I'm just like okay today no matter what happens I'm going to stay in this mood you know it doesn't matter what he says it's not important just be present and be in a calm mood and nonreactive move. For me is like the most important thing to be non-reactive born as a reactor I've never set intentions before that's fine to me when you set an intention of that sort of like narrow your focus for all intention like there could be an arrow in tension or there could be an overall intention like you know for me like the my whole therapy experience was to calm down to not be running around and be on my phone Non-Stop and not be present not looking at people when I'm talking to them having five conversations at once you know for so many years on the show that's how I managed things I was just 85 things were coming in my in you know and I would just do I'm all really kind of half-ass instead of intending to have everything be my main focus so it's not setting an intention in like you know it's more like today don't be a cunt do you fucking cuz I think it's overall a very different personalities you Dan and Jenny temperaments so Jenny what number are you on the Enneagram did we decide I must three I'm like a tried-and-true 33 and what are you do you know what you are on an Enneagram next time you come over that will keep us busy for at least two to three hours of pharmacological intuitive. It's a lot to handle for you and you get very excitable and I and what I've seen you drunk a few times and you're also getting very excited and I think that's great and why why why I take it further do not recommend I want I think anybody who has a hard time losing control now she's fearful of things you know more in terms of medical conditions are typical though that's 48 turning 40 that's what happens you'll get over that I mean I had that same kind of you know you realize that you're in to climb so fucked up getting older but yes I mean it is a cliche that you know what's you're in your forties you feel more confident than ever because I when I turn forty I think I have like a definite crisis than the election put it was like that you know a hat on a hat I end it all kind of swirled together on it foaming dated into like this is unmanageable tonality this wouldn't help them or it could hinder them know I think it could help you but you you have to know you have to trust like what Alex said I like she she my friend who came out to talk about ketamine therapy you have to trust and respect your brain chemistry you know what you're okay with that people know like they shouldn't push yourself beyond your boundaries unless you feel like you're in a very safe environment and the most important thing is to do something like this when you feel like you are in a very safe environment which we've done control freak and I don't love being drunk I don't I mean he actually does nothing to me like I could go to sleep on it it doesn't even affect my body for some reason but this drug specifically you feel like you're in you have so much control that was sort of the crazy realization to me was once I was on it after I got over that initial like om dizzy it was like oh woah I'm feel completely say I'm fully alert aware of my environment like almost hyper-aware so you know I mean I was always a fan of cocaine when I was in my drug phase and I felt like you have that same sort of like I could function on this it's like virtual reality Visions it's not like a mushroom where you know I sit in like a bathroom mirror and like dig for zits that don't exist it's not that so it seems like you're more like a mental control but you're physically out of control like that dizzy feeling and you know not having control of your body the shaman decided that he was done with us because I don't know maybe we were laughing and he said that like our trip was over and it keep cut it short by like four hours fine I was like I'm hungry I want some of those jungle noodles they make here let's go let's just like go downstairs and have dinner yeah you are at like that I like that post hi hungry too I like that where you're like oh yeah it's exhausted from your night it's especially when you do mushrooms to like the end of the night who wants pizza that's the kind of the best oil in the forest has been eating ginger for it because it's necessary for what's going on with you and I do want to say I did when I went in there I was like this is going to be a happy experience this is going to be fun and yeah I was like you're going to this is going to be happy like the whole time I was just like nothing bad's going to happen and and I did so that's also good thing to say to yourself yet or why you would so much focus on your sister though cuz you're a bunch of siblings so I would think that it must have been a subconscious understanding of my own to know that I've behaved badly or that I was being too harsh on her and it was just kind of coming to light in that way so that if I mean it had to be in my subconscious somewhere or you don't recognize in yourself so I'm wondering like what in the way that shave lives do you most recognized about yourself question cuz I didn't know the last part that you started to self-reflect and you didn't like that image and that's probably because Sean is very comfortable like not having people around or just being in her element and you're not like there was a time where you don't like being at the house especially don't like being alone yeah I probably see things in just like me and she's got kids and she you have about yourself so extravagant like you're always trying to fill something like you said in the past about like these extreme activities like you're always on to the next thing and it just lately that you kind of rain. In and like I don't have to do that all know I've all cuz I read that book essentialism which Jenny you should read too I think I sent it to you John Wright essentialism by Greg McKeown it's great it's about just doing less better and not doing everything poorly about really focusing on things I'll drop off a cup of coffee but what you're saying about the activity like the crate you know the skiing and the you know like whatever I like to do kind of like extremists in a way I like I like to go for it so hard is and my psychiatrist told me he's like those are the moments where your present course you love it because that's the only time in your life you've been present when you're skiing down a mountain 9 mm are you have to pay attention and you call well that's interesting because that's why you feel the most alive that's why you're so drawn to those activities if you could incorporate that into your real life and be present in your real life like that you'll still feel the same Thrills and rushes but you know you have to be paying attention all the time so it's just another argument for being present and for reminding myself if I'm in the middle of a conversation and I start thinking about something else if I'm driving and I'm not thinking at all it's like breathe be present you know that's my issue mostly and I've really enjoyed learning how to do that because it's kept its gay no now I can read a book without checking my phone every chapter even though I just read a bunch. Jenny that we're going to have to send you dad gave me a book called Tampa I'm reading or are you this is a very disturbing subject matter of fact but it is very well written and somehow very Darkly funny so yeah I feel like you know cuz sometimes I could be burdensome to give someone a bug that's like a fact now I got to read this now but clearly at work so you liked it. It's funny and it allows you to know I would not say it arouse me but thank you for throwing that out there Dan tell us a little bit about where you are in your life cuz you have worked with me on my shows for the last how many years 8 before the something like that and then after we ended Chelsea you decided to go to school I started volunteering at a counseling center and liked it a lot and getting my master's and becoming amazing where are you going to be what are you in an average weight for a name after I went to school there are you kidding me know I started getting my master's at Antioch I loved it are you gassing people wait wait who are your professors oh my God I'd have to look at on my papers I don't remember I just remember everything class did you graduate from there no I got a movie and I left all that was the right thing to do. I have no more friends with Neighbors movie my friend just made this movie she always puts me in whatever she makes and and she made this move to call hoslers that's coming out this Friday and she wanted to put me in as seen on Constance Wu and I couldn't do it cuz I class so huge right now and it's tracking so well and you are such a great actor thank you and you didn't you didn't go do it I'm surprised they would have let you out one of the teachers there I'm just going to have a guy who Terry Terry something he was one of the Little Rock 5 I haven't had no oh my God it's one of the most incredible classes I've ever taken a little rock 5 so he was one of the one of the five students that was Bustin to Little Rock he's African-American and he was busting to go to this all white school when they were integrating the schools but you're watching we're studying it in class right we don't know until the very end that he was one of those kids like he doesn't reveal that it was one of the most insane classes I've ever take it I might go to school at Antioch I would love that. That's a pretty oh my God it's anyway because I want to learn about all that stuff I'm so interested it's amazing job well great everybody seems like they're growing up so I guess I just I guess the next step is discussing where we're going to do it again and who else were going to bring in do you think Jason's ready to do it Jenny you know what that's an interesting question because he know he's sober and he still feel even though he knows that you know I guess it has been used to treat addiction and whatnot I think he still has a little bit of trepidation with just the whole it being a drug thing right right now and I want to go get some hookers I go party I'm going to definitely not that drug but I don't know maybe for some like Jason like you know even like Advil Cold and Sinus could be a gateway drug who knows in your life now Jenny I need you use cannabis at all you know I really don't it makes me too paranoid and I ate an edible before Jason's birthday last year I was in sunken place I couldn't get out it was like a 3-day trip thats you overdose you overdose I just can't believe with microdosing would be too much cuz you can't get mints now like Petra has those Two and a Half Men pants that are just a wall Brandon actually just sent me you know what nevermind I'm waiting for your line to come out everything because of the vaping crisis so I have to strip after all the chemicals out of are Vapes and make sure that they are still smoke a bowl and effective because I don't want to put anything out there that is going to cause any damage and there are so many chemicals in these things so that's what we're working on two I'll be waiting I'm ready to be back together you guys Jenny it's really annoying that you're not here when are we going to see you again I'll be out there the beginning of October can you let me know this time so I shall go on tour in October to stray Leah oh God I know I'm so I feel like you're avoiding me under the impression I'm literally let me just tell you Chelsea was here in town we were in front of the theater where she was about to perform I get a call from my sister-in-law who tells me that they literally pulled the baby's arm out of his socket you know I guess it's called nursemaids elbow so what's with the arm at the elbow and we had to leave with was terrible his arm was in a n electric socket know that the socket the elbow came out of the socket my God that sounds terrible but I know so quick facts right they do that well move excuse to me well you guys went off and became parents and now you're paying the price is true it's very true well I love you I hope to see you soon thank you thank you Dan thank you Jenny thank you Brandon thank you guys bye bye bye okay we'll just sounds like a good time to take a break Brandon juice you on my charges on instacart I would like to give you credit because you taught me how to use it and then I just went off into the sunset with it and it allows me to do get my food without anybody screwing it up but that's not directed at anyone sitting here that's about big momma like I was going to the grocery store in the first place so that's a lie but it does allow me to order food while I'm even on the treadmill or at home or watching TV it's kind of nice to like take my time going through my grits like grocery shopping from bed and I try to do it sober and most of the time I am sober think about ordering your food from instacart is that you can use that time that you would normally spend going to the grocery store you can spend it exercising I mean if you like kids you can play with them if you like naps you can take one and go to instacart or I could download instacart app use promo code Chelsea at checkout and I will get me $10 off will it actually get all of you $10 off your first order as well go to instacart.com or use the mobile app and use promo code Chelsea Dan before we sign off do you want to say any parting words or do you have anything you want to share with our listeners I think the only thing I'm really interested in talking about oh yeah that's right you got a real Peloton I'm so so I have a Peloton now too and everyone won't shut the fuck up about Peloton switch is so annoying but when you told me these are two things you made me do get a Peloton no Tampa red and also to watch succession because I had started it and then I stopped it and you convinced me that I had to re-watch it and start again and I did start again last night and you were right and everybody's right because the two things everybody keeps talking about our succession and the Peloton and I want to say to the people from Peloton so annoying to hear so many people talk about a bike and to take Cody's class and to take Hannah's class it's just like fuck off fuck off it's just it's like a cult so now I'm resisting it and I'm going to do are you going to flex what are you doing with your shirt if I could if you want to think about the shaman the shaman in the rainforest is like not half the leader that any of those Peloton instructors are he's probably not wrong how do you say the Peloton yet Brandon has my bell she may have Okay and like in the middle of an effort I unironically am so inspired by these people speaking of Cody I think I think he's hilarious Jose get a sip of water grab a towel and get your life together sounds pretty gay is yeah I do think you should say so that it is a good workout you've mentioned why did we why do I have to say that I was obviously people love it and that's great I just want to hear about it so many times a day because I resist that but that's my own issue again I tried it several times I tried to take Cody's class I tried Hannah and I tried to somebody else and I cannot get past Matt wilpers okay and Dennis is the guy that is going to have to acclimate and take some slower classes or just do the scenic rides the only issue with some of the scenic rides is that you're riding over things that don't have a bike path so they take you over mountain ranges like you're riding your bike up a mountain and there's praise the resistance so that there's no there's no path there's a box if it doesn't make sense sometimes it's not the right anyone who's listening must know what I'm talking about and if you don't please don't contact me and if you do please stand up.
