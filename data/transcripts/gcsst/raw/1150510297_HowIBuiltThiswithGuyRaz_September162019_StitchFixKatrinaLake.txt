it's guy here so Katrina Lake still holds the record as the youngest female founder in the US to ever take a company public Stitch fix is also one of her recent crop of female found a company's net worth over a billion dollars the story of how Katrina built it is pretty incredible this episode first ran in April of last year but it's so good we think it's worth here again enjoy it. Seed-stage like it was a hundred percent just an idea and I are like 20 people and here's how I think the business model of shape up and then probably talk to 30 angel investors who said No and when you're doing something that nobody else is doing you're either the smartest or the stupidest person of the roadrunning PR is how I built this a show about innovators entrepreneurs idealists and the stories behind the movements they built I'm guy Raz Not Today Show how Katrina Lake defy the investment world to build a tech company that transformed clothes shopping online there's always that one buzzword or idea that everyone in Silicon Valley seems to be talking about couple years ago was cryptocurrency recently it's been blockchain but there's also a widely-held idea in the tech world that the days of retail stores are numbered. Of course this is a combination of wishful thinking and hyperbole but there is something to it especially with big retailers Macy's is struggling Bon-Ton and Toys R Us and filed for bankruptcy and in October of 2017 Lord & Taylor sold its Flagship building in Manhattan to wework that amazing Italian Renaissance Building on 5th Avenue is now worth more as a we work then as a department store and the main reason why of course is that people just aren't going into big department stores their buying a lot more stuff online convenience is a major reason of course but so is time time is increasingly limited and that's really work Katrina Lakes idea begins because she got older and busier with work she found that she had to last time to go shopping for clothes and only rich people could afford personal shopper so she said hey why not figure out a way to make that more affordable and less time-consuming that was the Genesis of Stitch fix and online personal shopping service but it wasn't necessarily going to be a slammed on business and in fact Katrina had a hard time raising money in the beginning but we'll get there she grew up in San Francisco in a bicultural home mom is Japanese dad is American and at the age of 15 her parents decided to move the family from the Bay Area to Minnesota which if you've seen Inside Out is the exact opposite of what happens in that movie like to go from in San Francisco at more diversity and like the high school that I went to was probably 70% Asian and then to go to a school in Minneapolis where I think there were three Asian people at three and a half if you include me in my class and we were a very bilingual bicultural household and so we my mom my mom spoke only Japanese to me still does and my dad obviously spoke only English and we celebrate a lot of Japanese holidays and we would bring lunch to school I think it was we had kind of like a schedule at three days a week it would be onigiri which is rice balls that have something in the middle and then two days a week ago sandwiches so I thought she was going to be a doctor like her dad but she ended up majoring in economics and after she graduated working at a consulting firm advising other businesses 22 years old and still not really sure what she wanted to do that point I wasn't thinking that I wanted to do something entrepreneurial but like I had all these ideas on what these businesses could do better this should be personalized it like this is just a transaction it should be an experience and likewise in your head or ideas that you actually told people that both are working with a large retailer and they actually said like that they wanted ideas of what's the future going to be like in this is in 2006 and was literally before the iPhone and like I had this idea where I was like why you know in a store why do you have to have every single size and ski on the floor if it seemed silly that is it a person has to walk in and like find the size and skew and then take it themselves to a fitting room and like I was like how about this idea where you like half of the store is a warehouse and distribution center and the other half is like a museum you walk around you see all these beautifully merchandise things and you log in when you come in and you get a wand and then you can just put the wind in front of the outfits that you think you like and then you walk into the back and it's like by guy like here's your fitting room and all the things that you wanted or whatever would be stacked up there and then there'll be recommendations and you know you could have one size up in one size down and you know it could just be like a much better experience and like going and weeding through rocks and try to find your thing I like people looked at me like I had seven heads so like you. In retrospect unlike that was crazy like if I was the CEO that retailer I feel like interesting idea totally impractical I was just like and so you know I mean I didn't share all the ideas and I wouldn't say that all of the ideas that I shared were well-received but like I had tons of ideas about how things to be done better can you work for this consulting firm I guess for like 2 years and then you decide to go work for a venture capital company why I really laughed because I was just like really unhappy with the amount of work and so I took this job at Avicii find which like I didn't actually want to be a venture capitalist then I you know I didn't it wasn't that industry that was appealing to me but I was like if I'm going to work at a place that's going to be the crazy retail idea the future like this is the way I can meet the next thing you actually thought if I'm working here I want to hear all these pictures and maybe I'll find a cool company and join exactly is of entrepreneurs and and like like money or were you on the analysis side where you in a room where these people coming pitch and you would throw like Shark Tank questions at them I'm like I took the notes and I would create investment memos that were like a summary of the opportunity and I could have my opinion on those things for sure but I wasn't an investor it was also it was a weird time to be Adventure because I was there from 07209 you know we have a little bit of a recession it was a weird time to be in Ventura and I didn't ultimately find the company they must have heard tons of ideas though totally I probably not over a hundred entrepreneurs in the time that I was there and the most important learning actually was that all of these people were just like super unqualified normal people with lots of ideas just like I was like you know making the case for their idea and so I think it was actually the more powerful thing was that I realize that if I have all these ideas about what should be happening like I don't need to be peanut gallery Lobby my idea that people like I should just do it myself and that I could do it myself but it still wasn't my like First Choice like my first choice would have still been like if I had met an entrepreneur who is amazing compelling and creating the retail of a feature like it was probably still my first choice to join somebody that just started myself but now all the sudden I had this other plan which is like well I guess if I do find that maybe there's a way that I could do it so when you come to a conclusion that maybe you can do this yourself what did you do I don't know that it was like a moment I think it just entered my mind is like this is another possibility and I actually ultimately applied to business school which instead of just bleeping into starting a business and that wasn't even a choice like it wasn't like I can start a business or go to business school job and my resume like that was just that was never a choice in my mind and so I was like I can take these two years I can be a mediocre student and you know my end goal by the end of the two years is I if I can have a company-funded if I can be paying myself a salary if I can be paying back my student loans the day I graduate then the risk profile entrepreneurship was terrible to me and then my plan B would be well if I can't do that I'll have this MBA from Harvard and I'll be able to join a great company in the great founder and do something interesting to Harvard as a student and did you like it I did it was right it was very different from maybe all of the experiences I have had we've heard the stories from especially from professors there but you could women who talked about health in the classroom the discussions tend to be in the hands of go up our man of the voices that you here mostly our men did you find that and was it a place where you felt comfortable raising your hand and talking that stereotype is probably probably was true but I did feel comfortable talking I think and I had a hard time disentangling Eno is it gender is it being from California and saying like like what were the things that created this to be true but like I did feel a little bit underestimated and I really tried to actively strip like out of my vocabulary your people say that even like a Southern accent makes people think a certain thing and I fell sounding like I was from California also did the same thing and so yeah I didn't feel like I was the most likely to succeed in the classroom had the idea for what would become such a social talk about I just leave it what's a early idea that came to you had it even began were you given an assignment where you told to analyze a problem like what what's the beginning of this so I had a bunch of and I kind of collected a bunch of CiCi's and ideas in my head if you look at Industries and have probably had like a little bit of an academic approach and I looked at these things but like the hunting and fishing industry it's I know it's crazy it's a huge industry it's massive people are super passionate about it it's really fragmented but also concentrated words like really Mom and Pop's or else there's like Orvis and anyway it's a super interesting industry because it's massive and there's an element of fashion actually worth like it whether it's technology or actual fashion things go out of style and so I rented a car and I drove to New Hampshire and like visited like to gun shops and likes to suck by the the second one I was like okay I just dropped the whole gun industry I just was like I don't care how big of an industry this is like I'm just not super passionate about it and also like I am not the person to like disrupt this industry and so is there is there must still be opportunity to be no disrupt the hunting and fishing this tree has been exploring a couple of ideas that I'm like this is a real thing and it has a reason to belong in the world and the idea of such facts was one that I also texted and explored in the way I did that was the idea was how can you be there couple different DC so one piece is overall it was just like more and more dollars are moving to e-commerce stores like this is the math that I found was super compelling for my time and Consulting was dollars are leaving sores and going to eat Commerce dollars gradually leave every one of those dollars is hugely hurtful to a store as it loses it because all the sudden you can't pay your rent and can't pay her people and so you like a 10% 15% decline in your store volume can kill a store and 10 or 15% didn't seem like all that much and so there's this kind of like death spiral that I kind of anticipated would happen with stores and Netflix and Blockbuster is kind of like the best example of it it's like even if 30% of the people in your town or using Netflix and 70% of the people in your town or going to Blockbuster like that Blockbuster probably can't make money in the death spiral component of it is like that one blockbuster closes and now the 70% of the people who lived in that town has to decide do I drive 10 miles to another Blockbuster 30% minority of people in my town or you are doing that was a probably a big conversation at that time because Netflix was killing Blockbusters a timer retail apparel stores and then on top of that I felt like there was this massive depersonalization of I'm retail that was happening which one you're buying toilet paper iPhone chargers or diapers is fine you don't need that to be personal but that totally ignored this category of apparel which is like deeply personal and deeply nuanced and our product categories that are super emotional like you're not kind of emotionally buying a box of Kleenex felt like you were very emotionally buying that plays early and so I felt like all of the emotion and you want have been stripped out and Commerce in that that wasn't the right approach to the idea was how can you deliver a really actually personal experience and apparel and use data and Technology to make that scalable into makeup better but why I mean why wouldn't you just you know the offer up a bunch of options and just let people can a scroll through the agency I live the beauty of on my shopping is really that time was you know you just infinite choices right you could just scroll through and find a thing you like yeah and I think for some customers you know that's a way that they want to shop but like I'm five foot two and so there's a whole world of apparel that's like literally not relevant to me just simply because they're not going to fit all because I'm the wrong height and there are things that you know if you're living in California you can go on a homepage and they're trying to sell you cashmere mittens and it's like that's totally irrelevant to me so if you feel back like what Stitch fix does it's like yes like if you could instead of going to a mall all day or instead of spending you know your entire evening with 30 browser tabs open to try to compare and contrast dye for jeans you want to buy if you could get a box sent to you that had two pairs of jeans or even better one pair of jeans and they fit you great that is an infinitely better experience than the other Alternatives out there because you have an idea about business where I can send a subscription box too close to people but how did you like has even begin to think of about how it's going to work so it the way it works is basically I would have friends or friends fill out a survey and you would let me know what size and style what things you like what brands do you like all that kind of stuff or had you already formed the company and named it this isn't 2010 I was experimenting as a student writing to other friends and students in Boston by side and then she was like I didn't really have that many friends in Boston and that was easy to meet strangers and so one of the things that I needed to prove to myself was like it wasn't going to be scalable for you to tell me OK and these are the 7 Things I want and then for me to go buy those things like the math doesn't work for that to be scalable and so you need to have a set of inventory are working from and so I was buying inventory a tree tell from boutiques in Boston and I would keep track of like it today but 14 day return policy or 30 day return policy and then I would use I wasn't making any money doing this but I would use that as my inventory so that when somebody was thought their profile I would then put together a box of things that were relevant based on what they shared in their profile and then they would try things on and then if they wanted to buy things they would write me a personal check and I would sell it to them and if they didn't want to keep it and if I ultimately didn't sell it within my 14 day return window ago and return to the boutique at $6,000 limit on it and you would buy them and then sell them in the market and how many friends were in on this at the beginning I discovered that the you actually could learn a lot from somebody and there's just this thesis around like do I have to like be with you in person to understand your style of who you are or can I do that through a survey and like I feel pretty confident like you to do at the resort right there are was the number of items thing I started out with 10 items and the reality was like people working to try on 10 items it's a lot it's a lot of work and you just look at something in your like now there's no way I'm going to like that and you just don't try everything on and so 10 was too many what else did I learn I think I learned the brand thing of like it didn't you know people were actually surprisingly very open to buying from brands that they weren't aware of and in fact found some value in finding brands that they wouldn't have normally have found on their own to did you pull the trigger and say all right let's let's leave form a business that's supposed to get an LLC going let's like make this real we don't actually the company wasn't formed until February 2011 but I kind of became all in on this and not other Concepts I would say like late 2010 so when you when you really feel like got this going in at that time it was not just you right you wasn't you are not the only one involved the company she was the wife of my friend and so how are you bringing this business and also being a student I schedule my classes so that they were a lot they were all lumped together in the middle either in the middle or the end of the week or did something with my scheduling that enabled me to be able to spend almost a week in California and sew in January and then again in February I spent almost a full week out here and what I would do out here was meet with Angel Investors and on Valentine's Day of 2011 we got a term sheet from Steve Anderson through other people and he gave you he gave a term sheet for 1/2 million dollars well and then said now go talk to other Angel Investors and try to find others to join the route and then probably talk to 30 other people who said no ultimately even though he had already said yeah yeah in that you took the research you gathered from these 20 people and you went to meet with investors in the Silicon Valley did you just you show them this day then you should see I try this on 20 friends in this is what we found right I mean you can understand you can understand I guess why they might have been skeptical. Example of a box with laminated cards and eat of the Box wasn't like all that nice looking like it's not like I had spent any money on branding or anything in it that seed-stage like it was a hundred percent just an idea explain wow you explained what the business model was at the time because I just to clarify Stitch fix today you sign up you paid 20 bucks a month you get five items sent to you every month depending on your subscription and if you buy them all you get a discount and if you return them all that's fine it's free but it's $20 a month essentially for a personal stylist write dollars and to be very clear like you don't have to do it on a monthly basis you could do a quarterly you can do it all a cart like you don't you know you don't need to commit to any time for him but it is every time you get a fix you paid $20 styling fee the $20 is credit towards anything that you choose to buy but the heart of it was really this like we're going to buy inventory we're going to get to know you were going to become experts on you client and we become experts on the products and then we're going to generate really great reputations at the intersection of those two things why are you keeping where exactly is it when I would go and raise a half million dollars from Steve Anderson like half of that was literally going to buy for dresses and clothes and Venture investors he did that not only would they hated that but you if in your business while you said we're going to personalized human beings involved in picking stuff I mean Venture people they don't like to pay people like they like companies that they're like they like user-generated content or they like you like something free they don't like to pay for human resources right and it was good feedback because ultimately inventory we are very good at managing inventory and we have to be in our model and damn people saw that and people were skeptical that you'd be able to execute over that. Of time when you're trying to raise money and all everybody essentially except for Steve said no was that demoralizing was it disheartening or whatever water off a duck's back I was both like you just you had to be able to have reason for confidence in what you were doing regardless of what Venture investors thought at the moment and so like you did have to have thick skin about it and you did have to let it be water on a duck's back but at the same time while we are doing like nobody else is really doing it for like a very long time and when you're doing something that nobody else is doing you are either the smartest or the stupidest person in the room when we come back why despite early growth the money man in Silicon Valley didn't want to give Stitch fix the valuation Katrina side it's deserved and how she fought back stay with us I'm gyros near listening to how I built this from NPR hey everyone just a quick thanks to our 2019 lead sponsor of how I built this campaign monitor the radically easy solution to email marketing with 80% of retail professionals indicating it has the highest driver customer retention email serves as digital marketing is most successful Channel and with campaign monitor that means a leveraging tools to empower your brand and spread your message right for free at campaign monitor.

fans don't know that he's black why people don't know black people always how do you feel about that Gladwell on Race pop culture and a whole lot more next time on it's been a minute from NPR hey welcome back to how I built this from NPR a guy Roz so it's the spring of 2011 and with the seed money she got from just one single investor Katrina Lake got a small office in San Francisco and got to work inside where they got the term sheet in April at find it and may I graduated and then in June moved out to Santa Fe in San Francisco was important to do it because this is where you want to live or because of the the tech industry or honestly you know the smart way to talk about it as the tech industry but honestly like when I first started the company has okay we have to be in New York since we're passionate and then like a couple months and I realize there's no reason to be in New York and turn away lots of lots of companies are here like I think it would have been really hard to do what we did anywhere else because we have many many data scientist and many many engineers and you don't rush respect it was not just about me being comfortable about it if we want The Fill on the vision of using technology to deliver our service like it would have been very difficult to do it elsewhere website with no we're not yet so the first seven months of Stitch fix like we did have a website actually it was their first name was rack habit which lasted for about 3 months before we got it was very clear that North Shore would have sued us for it if it was five seconds of looking at it like this you got to change your name kissing you used to call it a stitch fix the website yet and what is your first page look like coming soon do you want and then it said if you if you clicked on yes I want a part of the beta it would click you over to I forget if it was a Google doc or a survey monkey butt or something and then you fill out all your information and you say you're interested and we actually had a waitlist for a long time because we didn't have clothes to send to you that we're relevant and demand outpaced kind of what we had for a long time and so once I was ready for you I would send you a link that said like you know Stitch fix is ready for you and then I would I would send you a PayPal request for $20 and so the history of The Styling fee that we have was that I was worried that you could be a boss or somebody who's going to steal money for steal my clothes and so I felt like if you are willing to PayPal me $20 before I even sent you anything you are probably a legitimate human being who wasn't going to steal my clothes right and so I would PayPal request you for $20 you give me $20 and then I would send you a shipment of five items and inside there was like a paper return survey cuz we still didn't have a website and so it was a piece of paper that was like an Excel thing that had all the items and then you would fill out with words what you were going to keep what you are going to keep an explaining why and then we would have taskrabbit to a type that into Excel so that we had to go back and then based on what you were keeping in not keeping and none of your $20 styling fee I would send you a Paypal invoice for the neck and that was kind of hot worked in the anywhere and we're buying at wholesale and so we were buying six items at a time how did you know we would go to like Thursday shows you should go to and you can go introduce yourself to Brad's and you know soda brands weren't that interested in working with us but you know someone give us a shot and say like I don't know that's an interesting thing sure you can buy Six items from us and literally would buy Six of one thing at a time will not sure who was who was picking cook added you I mean that you obviously you know how to dress well you are well-dressed right here but I mean that's a big responsibility to like beat a personal stylist of you know even a hundred people even 30 people yeah I mean it was and I think when she would like February of 2012 first-year it's just it's like it was probably me yeah you are in San Francisco and it's you know you're potentially doing everything and you've got this website and are you in the word out it was literally just people telling other people and so it was 29 minutes 35 there was a hundred and ten then I was 235 and then it just like that summer 2011 those are the actual cohort numbers for each month and then I think after that it started getting the attention of what I would call like small to medium-sized influencers and so does info get right it certainly wasn't a bug and it wasn't like the bloggers that have like millions of followers but it was people who have like fifty thousand followers are a hundred thousand followers to email about it that I would and that was a really big driver for us for a long time so now you're starting to get some momentum and obviously you're growing you need more money you need millions of dollars when you would show up taking money was a challenging I mean people in tack or man and in this space you know going to be seized are probably used to sing mostly men was a gender Dynamic ever something that was present that you felt that you felt worked against do that made it harder to raise money or generate interest raising money was really hard and I think there are a lot of factors that contributed to it I mean certainly the inventory side like that's real like Silicon Valley venture investors want to buy software engineer so they want to buy acts like they don't want to buy close the gender Dynamic was real also your 94% of venture investors are mad and probably the majority of men don't feel passionate about dressing women curious what does a methodology about them and the genius of venture capitalists and you know how they take great risks but you know they can invest in hundreds or thousands of failures and they just have one 2 to like come out and look like Geniuses does mythology of the Oracle you know like this Oracle venture capitalist who's just you know GIF dead and can just pick winners but I don't think that really matches with reality yeah and it is like it creates another Dynamic to wear and I don't think I realized this at the time but you're right like they want billion dollar businesses and they would either rather they want you to be a zero or a billion and everything in the middle is not that attractive and so people were like this is a real business and its really working but you know I don't know if it can be more than a 30 million dollar revenue or more than like a hundred million dollars in Revenue like I just don't think it's that big and like to a normal person pee billion dollars are a hundred million dollars in the same same but like but from a venture capitalist perspective like they make the most money when it's a billion or 0 and so you know there a lot of people who are like hey what you're doing is traction it's real and it's working but like I don't think it can be big enough for me to be interested in you still raised a fair amount of money and like 42 million dollars in the beginning which which sounds pretty good but I guess you still needed to to keep at it once we had a little bit of traction and some weird ways it made it harder because now all the sudden people are like you're trying to put that billion dollar price tag on you and trying to figure out like you know is this big enough and so in the middle it was really hard and the middle to raise money in the middle yeah that to raise money it was really fun preferable or on the way to profitability and I hated it like I hated raising money I didn't feel good I like it wasn't my intention when I started the company let me do this with as little Capital as I can but after a couple of experiences with fundraising I was like I want to do this as little as I possibly can let me know the company is growing and then I guess we should we should mention here that you guys employ a lot of data scientist like a huge number did you just sort of become like at like a data company of data tech company not just a fashion company I mean honestly from day Zero with we were always a data company like even like those return surveys that I described like even when we were physically shipping the fixes out of our office and we didn't even have a website we were collecting the data about the product the attributes of the product and we were collecting physically with pen and paper your feedback about what you like and what you didn't like and what you thought of the price and how it fit and so the data element was always super important but you know I don't think we were employing true data science I would say until I mean I don't know if that's right cuz Eric who Eric joined us in 2012 exit Netflix before he was a Daily Guide Netflix in your thinking while I'm in that doesn't get better than Netflix they know what you want to watch before you even grab the remote control right and especially the time is it before they're doing original content like their whole thing with algorithms and recommendations and he was like a Netflix we show you like a hundred recommendations at once and he was like we were just having this conversation we're like if we were really bull we would only show you 5 or 3 or if we were really bolt when you open Netflix widget start playing the content that you would want to play and he's like that's kind of what you're doing here with clothes and so he was very attracted to the fact that recommendations were like actually at the core of what we are doing are you able to describe your company in shorthand or did you ever described you as soon as look on Netflix for clothes really use that honestly but you know I think there are elements like we were 100% of our revenue is tied to recommendations like that's a very compelling thing to a data scientist who loves recommendations feeling like that's going to be at the core of what we're doing what point did you become profitable I'm we turn profitable we had a profitable quarter I think in 2014 so it took you three years to actually come from super fast yeah how much do you think about competition right because there I mean they're all kinds of potential competitors after all the obvious one being an artist is massive right and they did their fingers in every pie you know what's the the survey like the killer app for like that thing that you guys have that makes you sustainable and resistant to two big challenges and I think when we think about what special about Stitch fix it's been one to one human connections and the and the recommendations at the heart of it and so you know some of the things that are really hard in today's e-commerce are like if you want to find a pair of jeans that fit you like it's not a great user experience that have literally a million pairs of jeans that Jess from and try to filter and sort through those and you know that's an example of a place where like the human element of in these jeans have strep through these streets jeans don't have stretch in these are great for people who are your height and we know that with data like all of those attributes are hugely important in helping you find which one of those millions of pairs of jeans are the right ones for you and so you know there's a transacting part of e-commerce but before the transaction there is the Discovery is like what is the thing that you're going to love and that is a really hard problem to solve in today's e-commerce and one that I think we are uniquely good at solving how many people by the way work for Stitch fix today and leave over 5,000 employees well the stylus work because you've got a hybrid model right where all these humans are collaborating with with algorithms right and the way Stitch fix works if the integration of humans and data is that they're both very kind of richly combined and on and we see it as like they both are uniquely good at different things and so like a stylist should never have to worried about like you hate yellow or love yellow like the date I can take care of that and so I need to Stiles can see that but the data is going to exclude that from being able to be even available to your stylist and so on The Stylist will later on his or her own judgment over those recommendations to choose the right things for you and so in some cases the data science is going to be really accurate in like trying to figure out which jeans are best for you for example of the place where data science is I'm enormously helpful and then there are other times when on the Silas is layering on human judgment took this company public last November and the youngest female CEO to ever take a company public you know probably this year you will appear on Forbes list of wealthiest self-made women as you became more and more prominent and the company became more profitable and you start to get more attention all of a sudden you were sort of a successful woman and Tack kind of symbol or did you embrace it initially or how did you feel about that you know that's an interesting one where I think my mind has changed maybe even in the last year or two years at first I was really resistant to it like I really didn't like being a successful female CEO like I was like I just want to be a successful CEO and you know I think was changed about it now is that when I wrote my application essay to HBS like I wrote about Meg Whitman a female CEO in like they were so few people like I I still very much admire her and I did admire her then they're very few people for me to choose from and saying like who I want to be liked and now the being able to be part of what opens people's lens of possibility more I think is really powerful and I'm so I think now like I'm I don't know what kind of proud to be able to be part of that and like I'm very happy to wear that label and I'm very you know I think it's good for people to be able to see more examples of what success can look like that may be are different from what it look like in the past there was a story and when I came out maybe a year or so ago that at a certain point in your journey to raise money you experience harassment from a prominent partner at a prominent Venture Capital firm they released a statement of Entry saying to me like you know we should have done better something like that was that a common experience for you well I can't speak to that specific example but you know I think that there were real challenges with the power Dynamic I think of you know who has the power and who has the money and who doesn't you standing in front of a room of men really unfair that I don't think that's all that unless you change the proportion of men and women that are in leadership roles in venture capital and so you know I mean they're examples where like I was I was at a conference and Chris sacca was on stage like there are hundreds of people in the room like this isn't a secret he was saying this publicly and Chris Rock looks like I don't have an office in San Francisco like I just I live up in Tahoe in like you know entrepreneurs they come to me in like they come and hang out with me and Tahoe and they like drink beer is in my hot tub and like I got to know them and their businesses and like yeah there's part of that that you're like oh cool like that's different but like if you think about it like I'm sitting in the audience and like I think I was pregnant at the time and I'm like sitting in the audience I'm pregnant I'm like I'm not going to come meet you in a bikini and I can't even come into your hot tub because I'm pregnant and I can't drink your beer is because I'm pregnant and like you know there's just all of these structural element that like just make it harder and more challenging and like you know you just realize like well I guess I'm never going to be able to be in his Pipeline and like that's okay but like it's just there fewer is challenging and I'm wondering if since you know more and more of this stuff is coming out in more people are talking about it and we have Jenn Hyman on the show and she's talked about her experiences with with Rent the Runway weather some of that is trickling down in a way that's starting to change Behavior I don't know do you are you hearing that it anyway I certainly hope it is and I don't want to make it seem like everything is Sue for unfair and that everybody is a creep but like it that's that's really not the case I've had great Partnerships with Venture investors in by and large I think people have good intentions I do genuinely hope that it's it's getting better and the people are at least more aware and so you know my hope is at least being able to see the success stories created another pattern recognition for Venture investors YouTube earlier which is that in the midst of all this building his company you've got married and had a child to you became a mom and how was your kids now I mean that's a lot to balance yeah it's a lot and it is I don't know that I ever actively was thinking like I have this company and like I also need to have my life and you know but it was like I in the time of the company I'm at my husband I got married a baby like me I've gone through a lot of Life transitions through the company and and I think it's really healthy because I think you know in a lot of ways your company feels like you're kind of baby and you're always banging and I think I was I don't know lucky fortunate like you know whatever it is to be able to have had the space in my life to also be able to do you know to have those miles to so I should have met that I get knocked sometimes from some of our listeners giclee women who listen to say you know you you don't ask men about their children as much as you ask women and so I've been more mindful about doing that I think the one difference though is that you know as a woman you are carrying the child for 9 months and running the company I mean that's that's very different that is a that's a really to challenge me physically it's challenging and then you also have to put your emotional energy into your business 8 months pregnant and like your people didn't really know how to react to that and like I had a hard time navigating and I don't blame them because it's like it's different like I took a 16-week maternity leave I was out of the office for a 16 weeks and there are a couple things that I did I did some recruiting things like there are some things that I see you like only I could do but like I pretty much didn't set foot in the office for 16 weeks and you know that's the example that I have a very female employee base like me. If I'm not honoring the maternity leave policy that we have like how are people going to feel comfortable like yeah feeling like it's the right thing to do at 16 weeks yeah there's something that that I want to ask you about which is that pretty early on in building this company you you parted ways with your co-founder what's the story minute you guys just have a different sense of what you wanted to do with the company in the summer of 2012 and it was Emmy night and I was pulling out a lot of specifics I can share on it but like it was really hard and it like in a divorce he talked about like irreconcilable differences and like I feel like through that I really understood what that meant a like if you can be in a place where you really deeply care for somebody and at the same time you see things so differently and you can't you just can't see the future in the same way do you do you think that would that people who start up businesses are better off doing it on their own no I don't know I mean starting a company is such a team sport and you know I look back and I could not have done it without the many employees who believed in at the many clients who believes in that so like my friends who I didn't go to their wedding because I was like too poor and too busy at the time and like I mean there's just like it's such a team sport and you have to surround yourself with people who help you to achieve those goals and you know does that mean you have to have a co-founder or not like I don't know but like I couldn't imagine having done it without having a network of people who believe how much of the success of the company cuz you're still new and it's still early days right but obviously incredible amount of success in the spare time how much of that do you think is because of your skill and how much because of lack it's both there this wasn't easy and it was then handed to me on a platter and it wasn't obvious and and you know you had to find Faith from somewhere I was like this is going to work and then any I think in the skill category it's like I hired an amazing team you know to be able to identify an amazing people and somehow convince them to join this crazy company in 1100 square feet in San Francisco I mean there's blocking skills in both of those things but you know I think in general like this was not this is an idea many people had and it was actually executing the idea well that wasn't done before and it couldn't have been 100% luck Trina Lake founder of Stitch fix today Appliance and this year they're expecting to make about one and a half billion dollars and by the way when the company went public back in 2017 Katrina went to NASDAQ to ring the bell and In Her Arms was her one-year-old I was kind of like all right we're going to do it this way he's going to be up here and this are going to do it and he said he spit up all over me in the dress rehearsal I mean that that the funny thing is like if I had planned to have them up there there's no way it would have worked like he was he wasn't going to cooperate but the Stars aligned and it worked and please do stick around because it just a moment we're going to hear from you about the things you are building but first a quick things to Capital one's business credit card the spark cash card unlimited 2% cash back on everything you buy for your business Capital One what's in your wallet is it capitalone.com for more information when doesn't he saw someone that looked a lot like her friend's boyfriend on the dating app hinge I was like oh my God this something happened this week and Tiaras invisibilia it dives into the tricky business of sorting the real from the fake hey thanks so much for sticking around because it's time now for how you built that and today we are updating a story that first began about 8 years ago outside San Diego literally on a Manhunt we were searching for armed suspect the mission was tough the suspect was even tougher this is Justin Lee he was a sheriff's deputy at the time and he was one of the people chasing that suspect in the California desert it was incredibly hot 100 degrees is really hot if you're in San Diego and 40 lb of gear and Justin kept thinking there has to be a better way to stay cool out here now he didn't know much about design or engineering but after I got home he called up a friend who did management science and engineering major from Stanford around a bunch of different ideas for a few years they eventually designed a piece of clothing that could someone comfortable in hot or cold weather it's just a compression base layer shirt that would look a lot like a Nike or Under Armour shirt that somebody might buy a Dick's Sporting Goods but it had unique Pockets that could hold Heating and Cooling elements on Kickstarter the phone rang and it was actually the US Army the Army have been looking for a way to keep soldiers cool and they said the Justin hey we love the shirt but can you make it stay cooler for longer one way that we we put it as we built a scalpel for athletes and they asked us to build a sledgehammer for soldiers were they going to build that Sledgehammer well Justin and JD were stock for several weeks and then I was having drinks with a few friends that have just come home from Afghanistan they were marked that are shirt that was on Kickstarter reminded them of how they try to stay cool overseas which was they freeze bottled water and then they jamming in their body armor and that is when I had the light bulb moment of oh Justin light bulb moment was maybe I could create a frozen water bottle that you could strap directly to your body the way it works is you fill it with drinking water you freeze it overnight and then you wear it and as your body heat melts the ice you have cold water to drink JT and Justin called it the ice plate and it made it so we could stay cold for like 2 to 4 hours it took it back to the Army to pitch it but okay this is the Army right so turned out it was going to take years to deal with all the military red tape before Justin and JD could actually get a contract and we just couldn't do that we were going to be easily go broke so we took it to the commercial Market in August of 2016 negative push back from the market will never work that's a dumb idea there was every objection to some people just didn't get right away and we were just like oh my gosh that we just made the biggest mistake of our lives but just a few weeks after they launch the ice plate their luck completely changed September 2016 we got a live chat from a gentleman named Kevin Frye who work for Chick-fil-A at the time Chick-fil-A happened to be looking for a better way to keep their store employees cool on hot summer days so Chick-fil-A now uses the ice plates at about 200 of their stores so we can busy and since they launched their company about three years ago Justin and JD have sold about 30,000 total units to law enforcement construction workers even the Secret Service and they're on track to bring an almost 2 million dollars in Revenue this year this is the most fun I could have ever dreamed of having its nerdy engineering stuff it's helping the men and women who protect our country and our communities it is so much fun I could have designed a job this much fun if I try Justin Lee's company is called
