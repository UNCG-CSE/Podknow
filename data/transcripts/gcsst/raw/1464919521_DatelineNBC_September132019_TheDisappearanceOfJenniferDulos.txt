police not far from where Jennifer's estranged husband photo studios live with his girlfriend Michelle draconis police searching Downtown Hartford the Hartford at that time they're not telling us other saying it is that this is connected to The Disappearance case of Jennifer do Lowe's New Canaan chief of police krolikowski had called in the Cavalry from State Police to US Marshals to the FBI

to closest cell phone ping along a busy Street in Hartford at around 7 p.m. the Night Jennifer disappeared and when you go to those streets where are you where did investigators find themselves specifically everything was out Albany Avenue in Hartford and the investigators look through there and then they contacted the Hartford Intelligence Center Who provided some video the video came from the capital city Command Center this high-tech facility that captures beads for more than 700 cameras placed on busy streets and intersections throughout Hartford as luck would have some of those cameras were position on Albany Avenue what are the picture show the picture show folks we believer photos to Lowe's in Michelle draconis dropping off garbage bags variety containers along that whole stretch dolos was the main focus in Jennifer's disappearance the chief and his team to release vehicle like photos has a woman like his girlfriend a guy who look like ant that's right formation faster Front Page News besides video of garbage dumping Miller learn police also had footage of someone a FedEx box down a storm drain grate the FedEx box that's got two license plates inside that have been altered box out of the drain and inside down two license plates that had been doctored using tape the original license plate 516 W DJ had been modified to read 5T 6wb you start to wonder why would someone put a license plate on a mop and then thrashing exactly in the trash receptacle seen in the videos fishing out the garbage bags but they weren't quick enough to get all of them has been picked up and taken someplace right at least some of it the bags were taken to a large part for trash facility or police began sifting through tons of garbage is there anything that's been collected here that might lead us to learning about what happened to Jennifer doulas we're talkin piles of trash that these investigators are searching through garbage bags and the blood found in Jennifer's garage the bombshell results would lead to allegations and arrest coming up the girlfriend could she be the key to this mystery we see her back at the Farmington property is she helping investigators hey it's me Chuck Rosenberg this week on the oath I sit down with lead 911 prosecutor Rob Spencer we needed to treat this as a regular murder case except with nearly 3,000 victims Rob was the lead prosecutor in the trial of zacarias moussaoui the 9/11 conspirator and the only member of al-Qaeda ever to be tried in a US courtroom we were able to give even our avowed enemy who told us a try if he could he come back and kill everyone of us a fair trial join me for that conversation with lead 911 prosecutor Rob Spencer that's this week on msnbc's the oath available now wherever you get your podcast the search for Connecticut to continue to lead the Local 11 News throughout the summer anyone with any information is asked to visit find and Jennifer do lowes.com testicle picture come together with our spent money expended yet it's I believe State Police around a $600,000 in overtime we're about fifty thousand in overtime extraordinary case for your department what unusual and I think extraordinary in the state of Connecticut I don't think anyone's quite seen something as Dynamic and far-reaching and complicated as this occurring every branch of law enforcement worked on the particular piece of the puzzle forensics focused on what was found in Jennifer's garage the blood in Jennifer's garage Chief can you quantify yeah it was a substance that appeared like blood in the garage and subsequently there was a presumptive test on that it was human blood and the chief says they were more clues about that blood there was an appearance that it was tried to be cleaned up reports from the missing person case continue to drop on the chief's desk and the News was Graham the State Crime Lab sent over the results from those garbage bags dumped police Believe by photos and Michelle chaconas through court documents Shannon Miller learn what was in those bags clothing sponges and later mops that we learn from testing at the State Crime Lab contains Jennifer doulos is blood found a bloody shirt like one she's bleeding one that day it was a Vineyard Vines T shirt that she loved to wear and a bra that was actually found in that trash can but they were convinced crime had been committed and Michelle draconis 9 days after Jennifer went missing a hotel in Avon Connecticut and arrested them both on June 2nd they were arrested for hindering prosecution and tampering with evidence only comes out of the squad car with her head. This is not someone who wants to be seen at all on camera they both pleaded not guilty and were held on $500,000 Bond the judge ordered them not to have any further contact with one another draconis put up the money that day and was released but not he has trouble making cash pot right we know it she was able to bond that day she comes out of the courthouse wearing her ankle bracelet sweater over her head when you learned that photos doesn't have enough money to buy himself out the Builder of 15,000 square foot luxury homes should have a lot of money to watch other signs do Louis was having money troubles Jennifer's mother filed a lawsuit claiming he told her close to two million dollars in court filings he borrow to fund his luxury home building business so money is certainly an issue in the Dynamics of this family the prosecutor delivered another gut-punch photos his DNA was found mixed with Jennifer's Blood on the faucet in her kitchen is that in it self incriminating it's certainly a big part of the puzzle there's lots of pieces in the puzzle that hadn't been publicly disclosed and they won't be until the time is right but the puzzle is coming together nicely seem to be Michelle draconis after she bonded out she and her attorney met with the prosecutor and his team but after that Miller says trick Otis and investigators went on a field trip will see her back at the Farmington property and this Drone footage that we have shows what appears to be Michelle draconis leading investigators walking them around the Duelist property at this point is she helping investigators is she helping them lead them to Clues speak to Dateline which went by and no new news then the local paper the Hartford Courant reported on a man who said he discovered more clues in those garbage cans on Albany Avenue and there seems to be a straight guy who's driving around in a bin and comes up with bloody pillow and then finds a knife and we start to learn that he end up selling drugs according to the article the cans were the man found the bloody pillow and knife are the same ones do loss was seen dumping those garbage bags into the chief would not confirm the report I saw that story in the media going to give me this is a very active investigation and it's an act of prosecution not ready to comment on that it's been 3 months since Jennifer disappeared the chances of finding her alive aren't the window so what happens if she's never found if Jennifer is indeed the victim and the victim of Foul Play it doesn't mean that no one can be brought before a jury if you don't find the body believe it's it's an unusual in Connecticut for that to happen but not unheard of the cynical wisdom of police agencies everywhere of no body no crime has become evidence gruesome as it is to think of that short the way this case will progress is the facts and evidence will be analyzed by our state's attorney who is in charge of this investigation and he will then determine if he believes there is probable cause for additional charges I'm anticipating that Howard attorney Norm pattiz says bring it on my office off and says to me good luck when I'm leaving in the morning and I always say the state needs it coming up a head-turning claim code Jennifer have orchestrated her own disappearance Jennifer was a writer correct I've read your novel I've got a copy of it is it going girl no but it's close it's just unfathomable that this woman would have disappeared voluntarily 1/2 weeks after Jennifer disappeared pleaded not guilty to charges of tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution is what you call a beloved figure in the state of Connecticut is conspiracy theorist was staged as a hoax now he has another unpopular client info does doors why wouldn't I every man woman and child in Connecticut seem to hate the guy if ever there were a case made for a criminal defense lawyer this is hit charged with murder but he remains the focus of the investigation into Jennifer's disappearance but the wrong one went in the face of enormous public pressure and it's focused on but one suspect my client was home in Farmington 70 miles away from her house and he was observed next about 1:30 going from one location to another in Farmington now the state believes that somehow in that window he drove from Farmington down to New Canaan lay in wait for Jennifer kilder tried to clean up took the body out of the house moved her car hit the body and return to Farmington in broad daylight in one of the most densely populated parts of the United States botas is a talented man but he's not Houdini can you do these things with in this timeframe you were just that one we've worked it pretty hard to get from Farmington to New Canaan and do all that would be nearly miraculous but I suppose it would be possible as for that bit of Jennifer's blood investigators found in her kitchen mixed with Doodles is DNA as he can explain that mr. Douglas was in the home a few days before Jennifer disappeared a toned aspect of his DNA nnnnn drop of blood that the housekeeper didn't notice on a kitchen faucet so far from this being a bloody abattoir or Butcher Block which the state made it sound like in court it's something that took trained investigators time to find I'm not going to lose sleep over that may be the worst set of facture guy is facing is the story told by surveillance cameras in Hartford where he and someone consistent with looking like the girlfriend in a vehicle that looks like their vehicle wrapping stuff up in trash cans that's maybe as many as forty stops that that that has been widely misreported they if they stopped 30 times it was to Mustafa track fights the evidence that I've seen shows the truck that could be his stopped at two occasions near trash receptacles a man that appears to meet his subscription I couldn't you couldn't identify him from this how good are useful as the video if they will get it into evidence and the judge will tell a jury is for you to determine whether this resembles mr. doulas or not they can't make out the license plate that face is fuzzy for encounters his attorneys claims it states detective the front plate showed characters consistent with the letters and numerals on dool has his vehicle and it says the video showed a Caucasian male matching the physical appearance of emerging from the Ford pickup the state's attorney would not comment on the evidence because the case is an ongoing investigation to expect them to be charged with murder I think the state wants to and I think the public pressure is enormous and that's one of the reasons we've come out so hard and then so vocal in this case to raise her doubts publicly lights in the sky in the most provocative way Pat has his trying to raise those doubts as made splashy headlines in since Jennifer's loved ones Jennifer was a writer correct Patterson Jennifer wrote an unpublished novel which Echoes the plot of the popular book Gone Girl The Twisted Tail of a woman who vanishes leaving a trail of evidence to frame her husband for her murder in Jennifer's manuscript but he wouldn't let us see it I've read your novel I've got a copy of it is it going girl know but it's close so you arguing about this this manuscript and her State of Mind desperate frantic concern the POTUS might be any more time with the children willing to do just about anything to prevent that creative had the ability to think outside the box we don't know where she is she may well have killed herself we don't know we are investigating that no surprise that Jennifer's cap has been outraged by the attorneys Gone Girl Theory I think it's irresponsible it's untrue her friend Carrie Walters also because she says the novel is not at all what patterns describes it has nothing to do with her relationship with foetus or her marriage it has absolutely no parallel with the plot of Gone Girl none before the draft was finished 17 years before she disappeared and 10 years before Gone Girl was published not only that she says the grand girls scheme would be virtually impossible to carry out I fail to see how any of the logic is supposed to hang together it makes no sense to me how anyone could have staged a disappearance somehow leaving blood spatter somehow planting garbage bags none of those details have been address and these theories and that I find it Illuminating there is absolutely no way that Jennifer fiber do Lowe's would ever have left her children it's just unfathomable that this woman in particular of all people would have disappeared voluntarily mrs. Norm Patterson suggestion Jennifer may have killed herself saying that's equally unbelievable the going through a series is out there it's in the papers what do you think the strategy is I think it's an attempt to distract from the horrible reality that Jennifer's missing and something terrible has most likely happened to her I think trying to do in anyway turn Jennifer's disappearance back on her it is is hurtful to her family to her children to everyone who loves Jennifer Carey believes the investigators are right to be focusing on that messy divorce and photos tulips if you were sitting down opposite you as I am now to you what would you ask her for this where is she and when we come back we'll hear from the husband himself coming out as a lot I do I wish she were here to sort this mess out a spouse under suspension tells his story did you have anything to do with Jennifer's disappearance of Dateline exclusive Buddhist doulos remain out on Bond as he faced those two charges against him related to his wife's disappearance for a man at the Centre of such a big media storm do nose hasn't said much publicly but he did agree to speak with Dateline an exclusive interview Jennifer it was always a very beautiful person and she continues to be rich to the mother of his five children how is she is a mother she was a great mother I think she was an excellent mother and I hope that you can think is to be an excellent mother you use the present tense yes you believe Jennifer's alive I do against all circumstantial evidence or common understanding and I'd like to discuss this for my attorney's advice so I can on the advice of his attorney do Louis would not address the tales of the criminal case against him but he did discuss their acrimonious divorce proceedings before she disappeared it seemed as though you and Jennifer and everything going is a couple what happened what went catastrophically wrong in the marriage nothing wrong it's just people sometimes grow apart and I'm not putting the blame and I and her or me it just happens and it happens all the time but it never did get settled at the divorce no it didn't and I was going to be an amicable divorce and then one day she just took the children disappeared she had bodyguards and she ran the New York kids are going and where she with the kids and you haven't I was completely taken by surprise you file a restraining order against me that restraining order was shut down because it was based on information that was false that I had passports and I was going to run away that's very harsh documents words for her in the court records he frightens me is his sense of Revenge that was never never never any violence any abuse in any way Jennifer and I didn't even really are you all these years he says the money his in-laws provided was a gift not alone they say you owe them $2000000 alone it wasn't right back send the picture well that's laughable there's no Foundation the divorce remained unresolved but do law says he tried to build a new life Michelle troconis the woman with homemade had that Affair moved into his house in Farmington with her twelve-year-old daughter I would lie to you if I told you that I didn't have a very nice life had a beautiful life I was with somebody that was completely enamored with Michelle and the divorce was the only thing that wasn't supposed to be in my life and I couldn't wait for it to be over with but right now my life is a mess and I absolutely had no desire or interest to be in this mess his children are currently living with Jennifer's mother in New York City after his arrest of Court barred him from having any contact with them if you're not required to wear a monitoring device recycle a job interview. I have nothing to hide I gave the police says that I didn't cooperate with them actually went there and give him my phone willingly got a lot of information you know now yeah but nothing that I didn't want them to have they have all my computers so I have nothing to hide so you know they're building a circumstantial case against you but they talk about expecting to file more charges and as your attorney about we're not going to go there high I cannot talk about that put at some point you will have to talk about you like to explain some things I'm sure and that I will follow the lead of my attorney and no thank you and while he would not answer a number of our questions he did address of the critical question right now footage of anything to do with Jennifer Lawrence I did not but I'd like to leave it at that but you can say that much absolutely Andy says he continues to believe Jennifer is out there somewhere I wish she were here two to sort this mess out and I'm still hoping that's what she's going to show up that she's going to be at your door someday maybe not at my door by the time to her yes after our interview there was a knock on his door developments in the case of the missing Connecticut mother arrested him and Michelle troconis on another charge of tampering with evidence to Tails and photos in the arrest warrant affidavit filling pieces of this developing puzzle here's what that document lays out at 8:05 a.m. on the morning she disappeared Jennifer's SUV is seen in these photos returning to her home after dropping off her kids to school police believe Dumas was at the house lying in wait the crime and clean up occurred before 10:25 a.m. went to Lowe's has believed to be driving off in her SUV with Jennifer's body inside and just 100 feet away from where that SUV was later found abandoned in the City Park police have more security photos taken earlier that morning Tacoma pickup owned by one of those losses employees that truck was then seen driving back towards Farmington one of his properties police crime scene text later found Jennifer's blood in that vehicle and ask Michelle troconis to explain it she said well obviously all the evidence says because you showed me the picture of the blood in the door it's because the body of Jennifer at some point was in there to loosen troconis were released on bond Michelle's lawyer spoke to the cameras would like you to remember that Michelle is presumed innocent and she should be concerned I'm there's not much here that we hadn't heard before and I questioned the wisdom of these charges at this late date it's an exhausting fight I love my children that's about it are expected to appear in court soon to enter a plea on the new charges and ask for his children Carrie says she in Jennifer's family have made the kids there one clear priority you're in touch the children share about grandmother in their life a New York sure it's been with their grandmother's priority and all of us who are surrounding them with love to maintain some sense of structure and normalcy in their lives so they've been active going to day camp they made some new friends so I'm incredibly inspired by them fully accused her father's future is hazy at best lies ahead is it your photos will be charged with murder in this my hope is that we learn exactly what happened on May 24th and maybe leave to work so far has eluded investigators it will be no explanation until we find her the friends early family deserve it yes will there be an ending to this I have faith that they're there will be that's all for this edition of Dateline will see you again Friday at ten 9 Central and I'll see you tomorrow for NBC Nightly News I'm Lester Holt for all of us at NBC news good night hey guys Willie Geist here this week on the Sunday sit-down podcast music Superstar Sheryl Crow her journey from a small town in Missouri to the top of the music world get the podcast now for free wherever you download yours
