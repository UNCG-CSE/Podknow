I really want to make a 15 million dollar Equity investment in The Brady project that is the state had skin in the game and Bouchard was very impressed with that the site they chose was the town of Ashland Kentucky it's an Appalachian which has been hit by the downturn coal industry the new plant would employ up to 600 people now by both company officials and state officials as one of the most remarkable economic developments in Kentucky history you turn dirt and all of this is what pope smells like Brady Industries uploaded this video of Governor Matt Bevin to YouTube that's why there's music there on the same time Mitch McConnell talked aboutproject on the senate floor that more than a thousand construction jobs will be needed to help build a new aluminum Rolling Mill for Brady Industries recently broke ground on a new billion-dollar aluminum Mill that will create up to 1,500 jobs right next to Ashland Kentucky you know where we're talkin about the plan had some potential problems this kind of plant takes raw aluminum rolls it and then sells it to other companies to make things like ours but it turns out there's just not a lot of raw aluminum ore in the world not enough of these things called smelters that produce raw aluminum or so at one point Tom hamburger reported the CEO of braidy Industries Craig Bouchard got in touch with Executives from a massive Russian aluminum company that used to be run by the state a company called Russo & Russo what was building a new energy-efficient smelter in Siberia so hard working with rasol could give him access to Raw aluminum and to some capital for his plant time hamburger wrote that Bouchard quote became convinced that a partnership with Rizal would be a dream deal quote show in January 2019 Bouchard flies to Zurich Switzerland and has dinner with a rusal executive one side and on the other is this director of sales for Russell at the time but here's the potential problem with that dinner rasol at the time was under sanctions and to understand why you have to go back to almost a year before the dinner the day that former Russian spy was found twitching on a bench in England next to his unconscious daughter how a former spy accused of being a traitor to Russia is fighting for his life in Britain possibly after being poisoned in England on Sunday along with his 33-year old daughter the British government accused to Russian agents of poisoning them the government has concluded the principal for the act against Sergei skripal brush it denied any involvement several countries decided to retaliate the US joined with Western allies and imposing sanctions on several Russian introduced by the US government to Vladimir Putin's closest Circle and their companies are hitting some of the countries private businesses including this Russian company called Russo and its founding and controlling partner Oleg deripaska an oligarch and Russia considered very close to Vladimir Putin sew-in spring 2018 the United States Rose Oleg deripaska asset and basically made it illegal to do business with his company's but then 8 months later in December 2019 the US Treasury Department announced it wanted to lift the sanctions on Russia Saul treasury said deripaska would restructure his arrangement with Russe also he owned less than 50% and that he personally would remain under Section Trump Administration official said keeping result under sanctions was affecting the world wide aluminum Market but a lot of people in Congress were opposed to lifting the sanctions a resolution to block the move by treasury was introduced to the House of Representatives votes overwhelming with astonishing Republican support to reject lifting of sanctions from this D listing nothing has changed in the kremlin's behavior to Warrant the relaxation of these sanctions provocations by Vladimir Putin and his cronies require a decisive and for a response by the United States to vote in the house was 362 253 bipartisan support for keeping the sanctions in place clear bipartisan support but at that time it was a largely symbolic vote because just the day before the resolution to keep the sanctions in place had already been voted on in the Senate and that vote was the same day as the dinner in Zurich Switzerland when Bouchard was sitting across the table from a ruse all exact the Senate was just literally opening its debate about whether to permit the Trump Administration to lift sanctions on Russia's largest aluminum producer and the two guys sitting across the table at this upscale restaurant in Zurich Switzerland both had millions of dollars riding on the outcome of that debate and the boat that would occur within the next 24 hours did you ask Richard sir point-blank did you discuss sanctions at that dinner we did we ask him if they discussed the Senate debate over sanctions and he said that was not discuss he did tell us that both he and the Russo executive have as we would expect very good lawyers and they were advised that they could legally meet one another get to know one another and put the law of the sanctions law still in place would prevent them from having any substantiv negotiations about any future joint venture and so is he described it it was an amicable introductory chat and they did discuss sanctions in the sense that sang to one another if someday sanctions were lifted maybe we can get together and if in fact his description is accurate it is a legal and appropriate discussion under the law but still Tom hamburger says the timing just did not look good like McFall who is the former ambassador to Russia and the Russian scholar and now teaches at Stanford University he described it as shocking how blatantly transactional this looks and called for further explained Democrats have also raised questions about this timing and about whether there was any kind of advanced knowledge that members of Congress or the senate had before the boat took place those questions have been answered uniformly by Mitch McConnell and by Kentucky's Junior senator in the negative they had no knowledge beforehand that they're Russian firm was interested in this plan none the less at the coincidence that we described was as Ambassador mcfaul said shocking and hopefully we transactional it looks so if McConnell didn't know about it before the sanctions vote why are people criticizing him says it's basically to say what the day of the Senate vote McConnell invited treasury secretary Steven mnuchin to a lunch with Republican Senators to convince them to vote against the bill remember the Trump Administration was going to lift the sanctions on rusal but keep sanctions on Oleg deripaska hears manushan talking to reporters are we are trying to D-Link these companies so that they will not be under the influence and control of a sanctioned oligarch that's that that's our objective and any Republicans were skeptical and when Steve mnuchin left that lunch again with Mitch McConnell at his side he came out and told reporters he didn't know how the vote would go and when it did come up for a vote it was McConnell who led the debate on the senate floor misionero coach career civil servants at the treasury Department simply applied and implemented the law Congress itself wrote and in the end or Google the roll Baldwin came down to the wire it came down to just three votes the A's are 57 and the Nazar 42 and measure failed motion is not agreed to not long after Bruce all announced a major investment in the Kentucky project joint venture investment there was an announcement of an extraordinary investment in this new plant in Ashland Kentucky 200 billion dollars from Bruce on taking a 40% stake in the new aluminum Rolling Mill Mitch McConnell says he voted the way he did because of treasuries recommendation and that it had nothing to do with this proposed plant in his home state and again that he did not know about the Russell investment ahead of the sanctions vote but and here's the second thing Tom said is notable a few days before the vote another reporter for the Washington Post spotted a man named David bitter in McConnell's office better was a senator from Louisiana he's now a lobbyist and he and his firm work for Russell's parent company and around the time of the boat they were pushing for the sanctions to be lifted and I asked McConnell about the meeting with Vitter you only said quote we do not read out staff meetings better and his firm Mercury public affairs declined to comment Tom hamburger Washington Post says the bigger concern with this aluminum plant is that it could open the door to Russian influence which one of the things that's disconcerting to the mcfaul and other Russian Watchers about this it's not so much that they think illegal things might have occurred it's that in some ways that everything that occurred was in fact legal but suggest a very sophisticated way for Russian individuals connected to the Kremlin to enter the political and economic blood stream of the United States because of that concern the sanctions vote itself falling just three votes short of keeping sanctions in place in other words the benefit to Putin was decided by just three Senators what if permitted was an introduction of Russian capital and innocence Personnel into the Heartland into a state that's politically influential in part because it's the home state of the majority leader it also because it gives the part owners of a new aluminum plant a chance to study and get to know the US electricity grid and if the company should someday provide high grade aluminum to defense contractors it could provide some access to defense information so that is one story behind the Moscow Mitch hashtag there are a couple of others in the first one is that just before the 2016 elections intelligence agency said Russia was trying to interfere in the elections in favor of Donald Trump according to people who were there at the time Mitch McConnell was skeptical of the intelligence and said any public statement against Russia would be partisan politics McConnell did sign a bipartisan letter warning state election officials about potential attacks but his critics say this wasn't enough so I was going to Mitch the second one is the fact that Mitch McConnell has recently not allowed votes in the Senate I'm to election security bills even though the FBI and intelligence agencies have warned there's a risk of foreign intervention in the 2020 election the kind of people sent us a statement he wrote saying Russia did try to interfere in US elections and Congress does take election security seriously but he says election security should be handled by States not by the federal government again critics say he wasn't taking a strong enough stance against Russia and actually this is when the nickname was born it was Joe Scarborough morning anchor on MSNBC Joe Mich keep denying that Vladimir Putin continues to try to subvert American democracy Kentucky journalist Al cross who has covered McConnell for decades says McConnell usually isn't rattled by this kind of criticism but this one seemed to have gotten to him it's pretty unusual for Addison Mitchell McConnell to stand on the senate floor and give a 3500 word speech as he did a Russian asset Crystal player for the hyperventilating hacks who have an actually followed this issue every single member of the Senate agrees that Russian meddling was real and is real claims that anybody here tonight Obama's watch or just lost nonpartisan Distortion not clever spoon just total fabrication sort of brought to mind is old saying that it was a pebble respond to the boulder abused my Center seat to stand up to Russia and protect the United States of America I'm proud of my record I'm proud that it's right there in black and white and Liars cannot Gaslight it away but I'll cross says there are political concerns to as we told you in our previous episodes channel is up for reelection in 2020 in a state where the president is still very popular keep them from messing around and so on but I think that he's reluctant to move these bills because anything that has the aroma of Russia can put space between him and Donald Trump Donald Trump doesn't want to anything that even gives a hint that his election was not legitimate after the break One More Story We are following it's also in Kentucky this one playing out on some train tracks support for this podcast in the following message come from

today meet happy with zoom okay we are back and one of the stories we have reported on is the coal mining industry in Appalachia these counties we spent a bunch of time in in Virginia West Virginia and Kentucky where coal used to be king on the world right now I'm totally convinced about that the people have never left a year 1980 everybody still living like nothing's changed and I love see that's the problem with the commoners hear you got paid a lot of money for doing a manual labor job and now that that's going to go away and you've overextended yourself financially first drag your ass and do all these coal mines that's 36 inches high and crawl around on your hands and knees for 10 hours a day and then tell me you don't deserve what you get there's nothing here it's slowly dying as that feel that's because you know you got to if we don't have title will have to move I mean we'll win this area there's nothing left here you know without coal we we ain't got anybody really because you're going to be working your asses off all right thank you everybody that has not happened the Trump Administration has relaxed environmental regulations on the coal industry but us coal production has dropped to its lowest rate in 40 years coal plants are closing at a record rate and the number of people employed in coal is at an all-time low 1 coal company that operates a mine in Harlan County Kentucky recently went bankrupt and stopped paying its employees so the employees decided to try to do something about it what part of Sydney bowls with the Ohio Valley resource has been covering the story for the past month so we asked her to tell us about it black Jewel declares bankruptcy on July 1st and black Jewels over a thousand coal miners in Kentucky Ohio West Virginia and Wyoming are told to stop coming into work they're not officially late. But they're told just to stay home so they got in their last paycheck on June 28th they didn't know anything was wrong spent it on normal life expenses rent mortgage car payments only to find out a few days later that those checks bounced meanwhile because of black Jewels payment cycle they were supposed to get another paycheck in the middle of July but that didn't come through as well wow so essentially done about a month worth of work which I haven't been paid for and they're just kind of left wondering what's going on whether they still have jobs how much we talkin for someone like a month's pay it seems like folks are between 2000 and 4000 dollars in debt because of this they're also on the hook for fines with their bank and as time goes on there finding themselves unable to make car payments unable to make chemotherapy payments for their children it's just as time goes on the consequences of this lack of payment get more and more severe so on July 29th a woman who lives right near a black Jewel Cole loading facility sees a train being loaded up with Cole and she thinks to herself wait a minute black holes in bankruptcy how are they moving coal so she send a text around to some of the people that she knows that work there in about 5 minor decide they're going to go see what's going on should I go up to this loading facility and they see the train being bloated and they decide they're going to block the train they can give us our money is a juul can't afford to pay us our money we're not going to let that move is call out this is me off that's what makes me madder than anything in this world you like anything you won't take some me and you take some for my kids that's the end for you so that was over a month ago now and these miners have essentially been blockading this railroad blocking about 1.4 million dollars worth of coal for a program at an echo hasn't moved so how is the protest kind of grown and changed I guess over the month it started out as about five Miners and a few of their wives overtime it's grown and shrunk I think at the greatest they were probably over a hundred people camped out in multiple tents cooking food in an impromptu kitchen playing cornhole on the tracks there have been local musicians stop by to put on concerts for these folks games of touch football happening and in the street it's gone from this is real big party atmosphere to you know some days just two or three people sitting in camping chairs on the railroad tracks and no matter how many people are there are no matter how many kids were running around or what what the energy was like underneath that there's this real sense of anger that we shouldn't have to be doing this we don't want to be here we just want to get the payments that were due what is black Jewel say about all this what it what is their response to the protest did say that they were doing everything that they can to pay all of the people that they owe money to you including all of the businesses that had invested in Black Jewel they also encouraged miners to dig into their 401K is to cover immediate expenses but I will say you know it in terms of minors getting the payment that they're owed they are pretty far down on the list of of people that blocked you always money to their estimated to get anywhere between 1/5 and 1/8 of what they're with their owed after this new company copperglow took over the mine mine are still haven't seen that money so essentially at this point they're committed to continuing to occupy these train tracks until they see that money in the bank given what's happened with black Jewel these specific minors how did they feel about the future and whether or not the future is Cole oh that is such a complicated question and I think it's been weighing pretty heavily on on the minds of these Miners and their families you know I've spoken many times with one minor who both he and his wife just started nursing school they both decided that you know Healthcare was was more reliable industry than mining I talked to a number of miners actually some of the original five were blockading the railroad track back in July who I've given up on the industry in Kentucky they're moving to work in Union High School mines in Alabama I've talked to some folks who are pretty pessimistic about the state of cool saying you don't have a mortgage I have a car payment I can't afford to do anything else nothing no other job here will pay me the income that I was getting but you say miners are also worried that whatever company comes in next to run these Mines May pay them no to $3 last an hour and that in itself could leave them unable to pay bills that they could pay on their Blacula salaries sitting at one coal miner named John Curtis Christian recently been through bankruptcy and getting himself out of that and then he stopped getting his paycheck from black Jewel ugly I was able to get unemployment but my unemployment is roughly roughly $1,000 a month and I have a c a $1,200 mortgage payment $880 bankruptcy payment plus you know power bill you know all my other utilities so I've got you know three times more that needs to go out and when I have coming in coal mine has never been something I was I wanted to do it was part of my I guess Heritage you know my my dad and Papaw was and all that it always done it and I'm proud you know of the Heritage but it's just something I didn't want and don't you know don't want for my kids but just I'm done certainty you never know from one day to the next if you're going to have a job they'll get you used to making a whole lot of money and then kind of take it away a lot of people say it's either a super sniper Browning you'll never know from one day to the next and it's not really a safe job and it's it's always just slowly killing your body so by the time you if you do make it to retirement age you're not going to be able to enjoy nothing it's just not really a good career you know I've just seen so many people you know that are sold back broken and can't breathe and and her down from it that it just just didn't seem like something that I just wanted to be a part of you know it's a never-ending up and down cycle the desperation that this has caused the lasting Financial impact I think that cannot be underestimated and its impact will last far beyond this
