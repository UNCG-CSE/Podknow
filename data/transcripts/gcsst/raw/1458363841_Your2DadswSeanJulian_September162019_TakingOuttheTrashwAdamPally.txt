and review your dad and my dad and my dad and good Goldie is in first grade now and she doesn't want charity doesn't want me to walk her into the place she's like drop me off I'm like I thought it was high school when they were like embarrassed of you know and those how embarrassing is the first day for like a second and then I haven't had a chance to talk to him like that normal I don't know it's like and I was like friends with her kindergarten teacher and now it's like you know welcome it's so weird but that's what happened was they grow up yeah I guess that's the difference between kindergarten and first grade is like kindergarten teachers are high all the time but hang out with some rent a little bit of time the curriculum is not as stressful so they they have some time but yeah that's been going on and what what's a first grade teacher like cuz my first grade teacher freaking suck mine was the best my favorite Elementary School teacher was my first grade teacher Goldie's is she seems fine she's like she seems pretty warm but not like she's not like a kindergartner a little more distance yeah first grade is like we're like the first time like kids learn about like disappointment didn't like we're like teachers actually like reprimand a little bit like in kindergarten like your teacher like betting Billy Madison kind of nailed what a kindergarten teacher is is there like a fucking weirdo and like they like they're like burning man like you have you ever wonder what people who go to Burning Man do the rest of the year they teach kindergarten was a cop there seems to be some uncomplicated socially going on with Kodi I'm trying to get to the bottom of it but she's like making she's sitting with the boys at lunch and the edit seems to me like a boys don't really want her there but she's like not letting them stopper from it and so there's like a contention there and I'm trying to figure out how to like be supportive of that but also be like you don't need to give people energy that are not welcoming you like you don't poison boys are dicks in first grade already yeah boy boys are dicks until they had about 30 years old I think I truly believe like boys should be Lord of the Flies still there like 30 right and then then you put them in society that's pretty good and Lulu is she loves Morrissey and the Smiths and then was painting to Morrissey and the Smiths and it was awesome and the Morrissey because we didn't tell her the bad news about a member of the white nationalist group like Frontline or did he join like officially join a political oh yeah like yeah yeah he's like so Pro brexit yeah he's real bad and then you're like hey here's a guy Joe White he's sad but so far he's also rates but I do with my kid as we drive around we will send it tsol just the song about fucking corpse it's like but I line up with them politically you know you could you could be raising Nolan on artist that you love right now and that seemed totally go okay and then and then 20 years from now there to begin oh well I mean he really likes the Ramones and Johnny Ramone is was a republican you didn't know that now he he was like like my today voted no soup or Johnny the guitarist very very rip up again after 9/11 he became what's it called islamophobic yeah but then he died of cancer and everybody yeah I know is we are all vape we all Vape my dad my dad's in town and he like my parents have been become so brainwashed by Fox News they just make stuff up now like that they're not even hearing all the news they just there like we get it we don't know how to do this yeah they're like a lying to themselves and then sharing what the world where Fox News taught him how to fish he was just like if you talk to a hundred people 60 of them babe I'm like a hundred people just a random 60% of the world Vapes is what you're trying to tell me is like I'd like to have any stats back that out because like I know one of the eight people who died from the the lung collapsing from Jules and I'm like made out of and also do you think she just made that up yes we're here. It's so weird so weird their strangeness like it's okay if you feel right about it if they're teaching people over 50 years old they brainwash an entire generation of people forget how you how you is you blocked their Fox News Channel last time I was on my block their Fox News Channel and it was a fucking disaster I I thought I was going to be like a fun little thing in my mom called me up like in hysterics crying because of that I don't think my little brother knows how to do that ok I could have blamed Aaron Burr it's also super easy to unblock when she called me as if like a family member had passed away like in tears going yeah that's so she can watch Hannity and it has come to spare all over ass a little weird but also the good thing though is this is the first time my parents have been in LA and like the last four years were they haven't sat like things are a little different in Los Angeles the way they say Los Angeles really bought why are they here for an event or no they can't because of that last night they wanted to see me in a tuxedo and I like a man watch Nolan while we went there oh that's cool cool and you're at the Emmys has that the enemy will talk about that more later I lost I lost it in that damn it says Nanette cuz you lost to her not doing comedy anymore yeah I lost a Comedy Award to a woman who was quitting, and hers go in her body of work the voters not hurt a little bit when we will talk more about the Emmys cuz our guest this week is Adam Pally from you might have seen them on Happy Endings yes had we had a sitcom for a while you can still watch on Hulu we we don't talk about it but you could watch him a you should have watched them on Champaign ill which is on YouTube is that YouTube original thing with him and Sam Richardson that was so fucking funny sandwiches and so funny I know they know we know that cuz he's here yeah but yeah that's that's why I didn't I never watch that sounds great great and he's in the new show airing in the winter called indebted on NBC to new NBC sitcom so he's great we have to get better at introductions black vs SA node for both of us were real bad now I'm saying is over all this podcast I think works from beginning to end except for a huge hammock in the middle no I'm I'm saying I think it's very entertaining to give notes live on people when people are listening at home they're like what the record for longest introduction is so good he deserves a longest one gentleman is here because I want to talk to you about ancestry DNA you ever wonder where your family comes from I mean you've

stuff that is one of the downsides of somebody who wants to hear their intro no no no thank you so much I'm always as a guest of podcasts it's the most awkward time because they don't first there's a 10-minute like Freeform ramp-up of the week that a host can do while you're sitting there in your kind of like do I chime in on you realize how awkward that is so we just do that yeah it's amazing this is great as part of your interview take me to go fuck that accept well that as long as you have you ever had ever jumped into earlier than to give you a dirty looking like okay come on frustrating thing you could you like what you are doing good either so we're just how about Sean was out late last night and for a dad 2 a.m. is like the latest that you can say I can imagine being out at 7:30 he like climbed in the bed at 7:30 and he has this thing if I'm sleeping I always pretend to sleep and then he jumps on me and goes wake up wake up wake up and today he did that you're not okay with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs 16 by The Hungover with children so much of my life that way so much of it daily did you go out last night I did not go out last night I I don't know why I it's unlike me I just was I felt like a lot of work and I and I was referring to the Emmys by the way we know I wouldn't go out that one of the creative arts Emmys which is like the ugly Emmys like like you see Jonathan Van Ness in your like Starstruck cuz it's that's it last night saw like posts from it and I was like how did I I know I'm out of touch cuz I don't care anymore but I'm like how did I miss the Emmys like it was like 15,000 every celebrity there like a big part of the night was like the below the deck people from Bravo think I think I think I had the biggest star co-presenter than I am a backstage people were going nuts over my co-presenter Marie kondo I will say my wife I caught her texting going Adam Pally presenting with Marie kondo that's the only good thing about tonight. It was nice that should show you I like you Kroll and Rachel Bloom worthy of the only high point of the night at that and Beyonce finally taking a fucking hell wow lot of aggression as face because I only really that's very hot right now only because I've always wanted to be on that side of it was such an easy bit that they that they wrote it like that I didn't watch it so it was a televised Channel Erin Marie gamber that was only let me check, I forgot I like just didn't know that was Marie she is I don't even know she like she goes that she she she goes on a long rant about order and and and clutter and then I go. You're so awesome the rest of the day it was just like them free solo climbing then last night was the wrong night time in all free solo 3 Solo with no destination I heard you reference a game you play with Marie what was was that what was that game well. She was nominated was so they kept us it's usually like pretty seamless rent but last night was not seamless be like usually is pretty seamless the like walkie you come offstage not I can run you back to a seed or something the last time is there's a lot of things going on probably not enough hands and so we came offstage and they were so me and Marie, like standing there and she was nominated for the awards they had to like cut to her but I don't think they knew that I presented with her like I'm not part of that production team right thing so I'm standing outside because the guy wouldn't let me move to not like take any credit Batman she lost and it did a light switch and she's not happy so few things that get talked about from I'm in like everyday conversation expect when you like come over to America to present at the night one of the creative arts Debbie that you're probably going to get in there yeah what she lives in Beverly Hills eyeshadow she lives in Beverly Hills Irish play I came all the way down or no gift bag wow but I'm hoping that this will like somehow down the line turn into some kind of Goodwill the television Academy I don't feel bad for making it right of course they are that goes for a lot of how many years have is there like well he finally look at 1 all right how are shows always make it right this is a crazy Segway but I'm taking it I refereed soccer kids soccer for a while at like two years ago and I made the worst call ever and you feel terrible extra terrible when it's kids cuz they care so much I made her bad call and I think it cost the team a goal or some like that so then later I just gave them a call that was like oh my God the coach the other team came right little league are the little kid who threw like way too hard for a little kid to be throwing that hard and I would win sand just guess if it was a baller straight and a guy I just came after 15 years old my ass about that as far as ethically I don't know why this is pregnant I need to be like as far as ethical reference for all right like is there a is there a responsibility on the referee to look deeper than just a single play at the moment I think they do that I think they decide like a certain series and games and stuff like that there like we're going to look at this whole game as like we're going to let them be more physical or we're going to let that you know they mean more like 2 or like if there's a call that's obviously missed like you're saying like like they're like right now you know I'm an Empire it's like call zafer home run that was obviously foul and even the replay can't sort it out next time there's like a you know makeup calls exist so much in baseball like you know you'll see like sure the next time we can go bad see why you no make it up but but but but does that affect is that the right way to referee or umpire do you have time to go look at this from a big picture that the guy was so mad at me I still remember it I mean I was like 4:17 or something and being it when people when adults are you it's like the worst like when you just get yelled at is big is the worst feeling so to this day I can still summon that feeling and I'm glad that you're letting me off the hook I did the right thing yeah I know I just cuz like I was mad at me doesn't mean I was looking back on it now I mean you know I mean it's a bigger conversation sort out but yeah I know I was I was Release Yourself from that pain children that seems like a lot it is a lot 762 we had a Irish twins and then instead of shutting it down we're like let's have a baby and then then shut it down yeah I have a two-year-old in that with a two-year-old cuz like it's not it's not easy even really know but it is but like it is they they they don't have anything in common but you forget the way you felt about a young sibling you know what I mean like I had a young I grew up in a family of 3 in of the oldest and my sisters 8 years younger than me and I remember feeling this immense like pride and ownership over the baby yes of course cuz it's like this part of your family hears ya your family as if your 8 years old is so you're still a kid but your family your family is given this like a new toy dry thing that like is now going every is not part of the family and I was too old to be like I hate that I'm not getting the attention so I do for a living but I I you know was able to be psyched about I think my kids are two day that they really like having a baby they call it you know they are baby it's like it very much if you know he's very Advanced obviously because he has these little kids that has little but it's it's cool you know I'm at level I like it like having twins cuz one's a boy and one's a girl and I think that mentally there probably right on the same as boys are dumb yeah and they'd never stopped running no they don't stop moving just only to eat like all your food yeah cuz you have all girls but like truly like my son this morning when I out of bed he was like he took off his diaper and he was just like pinching his penis all right yeah it's like so fun it's like shot out of a cannon you watch the boys when I drop goalie off at school at the boys are just like I mean they were climbing the fences they're like throwing each other into the woods and crazy and the girls are literally already just like talking quietly with each other so that there's a lot of competition and they know it's gnarly on a plane but it's also $7,000 that we can fly anywhere we don't go anywhere they wanted it there like this is her world outside of New York in California weather like there's Weehawken $15 to go to Lincoln Tunnel, Co very expensive Randall's Island you like stuck in this place I heard this year was the first year in like something like forty years that New York City lost population yeah the stairwell Manhattan property yeah well Brooklyn is so cool and it's the same thing that like it's just a stop different it's like living in the valley it's like Studio City versus there's no difference between any part of Brooklyn in New York city so in terms of cost now yeah just gentrification and it's the same thing like the West Village looks exactly like Williamsburg works exactly like are you in a neighborhood with a lot of children yeah yes yeah cuz New York City kid like family I'm just curious what that's like a free kids and they had to be fun I remember the New York I mean are you ready for your kids to be like the more experienced kids I can't cuz I remember I went to basketball camp in like they were offering to Eden's end it yeah the New York kids were like the girls and I think that's what surprised the family they came from is wow I think back now is to where that kid is and what his family was like and maybe that was also assume that he's super you is Russell Simmons right but I don't know if that's the case anymore after parenting both in LA and New York and then also shooting over the last couple years in a lot of different places and having to take my kids with me the world is so small now and everybody does the same thing that I don't know if New York City is that much more advanced than like Silver Lake or Los Feliz or you know what I mean like yeah it kind of seems like the same shit so maybe they'll be more advanced because like every time we come out of the local Chinese restaurant there's a homeless guy with one foot and no toes but like so I don't know I don't I don't know about that scary know that makes sense though I quit the I guess the internet has made everyone's the same as anyway Instagram or Twitter or video games or fortnite or I mean you're getting on watches like videos on the internet right now you can have that you know what else he was so when the kid from the city where the billboard was who saw it you know everyday brought it to you like what I'm getting information but as a kid not like my house and it's all the same my son knows what's what movies are coming out before I do probably before most people that work in the studio so I don't know it just feels like maybe that'll happen he's just probably going to know by public transportation system better is there a lot of like playgrounds and parks and stuff to do that much do it more than we do it by The High Line yeah we go to The High Line all the time is great for kids and I like not having to drive everywhere it's sometimes harder but it's nice to not like I roll in five deep on a sidewalk though yeah why I own the sidewalk it's awesome the rest of the artists like this all the time like it's rainy and windy and winners got to be rough when there's three kids and when I get the thing that we noticed when I moved to New York from La was that like there's certain arguments you don't have with your kids in New York like getting your kid to put on a jacket was a new totally new thing for us like in LA if it's like 60° you know you like to get cold they don't you're like I guess you're not a warm-blooded something I should say when I get sick like when but then in New York it's totally different for you learn it like the first week it's cold out and like put on a jacket and the kids like no I'm not putting on a jacket jacket and they don't remember that right there like 3 so then you go back up and you're like there's a jacket like I'm not wearing a back she like it's maddening you know because you're still dealing with a child Blake that is a whole new set of set of arguments where you're their well-being it's like another thing that you don't have to worry about here yeah like you never really have to Brave your kids for the conditions like yeah oh yeah exactly like bust open and you can just live there and you could be like in Pomona it seems the same as Glendale Glendale like what there's a lot I love Glendale I don't know what the differences are minimal emotionally I think what kind of schools are they going to there in three different schools oh my God is up top mornings are hard but it's always easier like my daughter's 6 get there's no school buses in the orgasm I don't remember seeing how you doing just put them in like a cab and go might be like I work at the hotel in Home Alone 2 does the school bus that comes and picks up my daughter and then we get we have a car and we get in the car and we do to we dropped my son on the upper west side near where that bus is taking my daughter Landmark the babies like how many like 3 days a week I think and it's kind of minimal yeah and we are Nanny. Like we have it's doable but yeah but it would be the same here but yeah I mean it is I mean yeah my son's In Like Preschool in 2 days a week and it's just like I have to go to the exact opposite way I go to work late to drop him off at skined of annoying yet if I do it because I did you ask production if you can move it to closer to his school studios in Glendale at that Vic the getting the kids around and you are can be a little easier Uber it's kind of great you know and there's like three different kinds of them in New York so there is competing prices what's the third one Juno oh I don't know do you know do you know the great what's the local New York like and that the OU don't know about you at all for now and the Cavs have started their own app thing which is kind of great too because the Cavs have like heads arrival their prices like easy to get around in New York and you're not going anywhere you're stupid like you're going 10 blocks and so everything is really quick and you can you can do a lot more during the day you know even though I have like a trunk pure I have two errands to run one of them is not getting done on my way here I was sacrificing things I have to do already thank you so much I will be right back with more your Two Dads hey guys I want to talk to you about talk-space heading back to school comes with a lot of tough emotions there's new people new responsibilities even do places and as a parent watching your kids deal with anxiety can be hard to watch it's even harder than having your own anxiety that's why I want to talk to you about talk-space talk-space believes no student should have to wait to get support they might need with the talk-space student plan students can connect with their therapist in less than 24 hours they'll choose from a selection of recommended therapist and get started right away no more waiting and if their first therapist isn't the right fit they can always switch therapist at no extra cost. Obviously I'm a parent that's what this show is about and if I thought for any reason that I couldn't talk to my kid about what they might be going through I would feel so much better if I knew they were talking to somebody and especially somebody with the rec with the credentials and the professionalism to really help them talk space is awesome and I and I'm definitely going to use it as my kid gets older if you have older kids this is a great time to get to join talk-space the talk space student plan pairs your student with a licensed therapist trained to address the challenges they faced

staying that long commercial break knows nothing forever shipstation if you had to guess what shipstation is what would you guess it is shipstation I would guess it's some sort of like deep like an internet like an iHeart thing you can click on in a car that is the sound of ships like helps you mail stuff or busted my name is trademarked so you're on a new show called indebted indebted yes BC and BC when does it air winner with Will and Grace I don't know what their plan is yet but when they told me to say winner with Will and Grace yeah and what's the premise of the show I play a dad of two married to Abby Elliott who's so awesome and you know we have a seemingly nice life and then my parents go broke and move in with us and they're played by Fran Drescher and Steven Weber has your first time ever playing a dad hates my TV yes I did it twice this year once in a Netflix movie that I'll be out this summer and sure Yeah Yeahs call the Main Event it feels a little early but I look out for it I know it'll be on your Netflix menu for like a day but it's fun playing at that is fun it's you know I don't like kid actors so that's a downer cuz anytime you're with anybody else's kid yeah it sucks like weird it's my sister's kid I love him like my own but if she's around I don't want anything to do with a sheet or job right if she were to be like can you watch my son to be like of course I love him yeah and then the whole time I was around him I would treat him like my own son right as soon as you walk back is biting somebody completely treated so do you have to hang out with like your TV kids we do play I got all their fine yeah how old are they supposed to be like what I fall apart be like around the Creator Dan Levy I got to get supposed to mimic his children so important for Dan Levy's son is best friends with my daughter okay so it's what's it's like that house a little bit and do the kids have large rolls in the Shelf sometimes it Ebbs and flows you know those weeks when they do it's so you know you have like weird hours right yeah you got to adjust which is again Ike at this point in my life not something I love doing but you know where is like kind of young you know I'm not to snow Steelers or anything like we did an episode about the tooth fairy and you know you're reading this dialogue but whether the tooth fairy exist or not in front of a 4 year olds and eight you know Abby and I kind of came to the realization the same time like she's it's happening in front of her now like we're saying like that the nice scene at the end where we're like we're where we joke that like the Tooth Fairy is not real sure that's how she is fine yeah and it's kind of like I don't want to do that to her you're ruining the magic of Life by putting her fault she's for you know right and then still like the rest of the week we're like trying to compensate and you know and she's a steadfastly being like the Tooth Fairy is real you know no matter what no matter what any of the other kids started like no he's not and it was just like you're watching you know it's like something you never really wanted to be involved in so I feel it's better to treat them like garbage cans place and I leave it alone a rummage through it and I don't want to find out what was made of SO2 me those kids are put away for the garbage people which are your parents with you I don't want you to learn anything from the most I've ever heard about an actress process and it's fascinating I mean my process has changed only to making sure there's distance between me and those can I find about it I'm like I'm good I just I find that is an actor cuz you are even though it's a family shown you still actor and you're like there's so much going on right now to be funny like the joke yeah you like you know 8 p.m. on NBC but you're like there's an adult process yeah you know yeah and when you're also at the same time have then to be like a like I can never imagine having those kids be my actual kids yeah I would lose my mind I agree I don't know if it seems so hard like there's like this like casting place like right around the corner and you'll see like these mobs they all look the same but they're kids that all look the same and it's they're just sitting there it just seems like the worst experience ever being a little kid in like begging my mom to audition for stuff and like it took me till like some talent agent in Belmar who definitely if I Googled him now if that's all I wanted and seeing and now as an adult I'm like wow my mom likes saved my life I was desperate to like do this shit wanted to do you know cuz I feel like a lot of us especially cuz I talk it from our area that you still far away from this jersey which is like you're outside the city the city is not even if it's about Hollywood in the movies like this is worth Three Amigos with me so far away that you'll do anything and then my mom and dad were like absolutely fucking yeah that one anywhere near that shit and it saved my life it did because now you get to do in adulthood like you understand how horrible I know what I've done to myself that I will never be filled out that has led me to a hundred different baptism but yeah I had to do it to a set and show them what it was like for the other kid that's actually doing it they be like maybe not but I wonder about the days are so long and the kids still seems like they're not in school right yeah they're not going to go to school for like a week to be like this sucks and do I'll do anything else I remember my oldest he went to school here in like it was such a fun hippy-dippy school and I remember the first day like taking her and and so excited and he was we pick him up he's like that was awesome and the next day he's like I don't want to go to school and you're like what it's so fun and he's like I want to stay here and you're like right yeah yeah it's tough to argue X5 air conditioning I'm not going to just a fucking couch is there's no couches in school yeah you're hanging out right like explaining in that like I'm not going to work right now but I go to work when I want to have to there with you right it's so that's a whole other thing to call you yet because call you they can ask to call is that that is the worst they can just grab a phone and call you Amanda no numbers they don't iPhones work but we're not doing that I mean we worked on it we were like it's important for them to know our phone numbers so we lost within the hour they were on the grandparents phone calling and then we like off its your mom for more time and it's like what's the schedule for tomorrow for us to do that now I have called you to tell you talkin about no and then like you'll be millions of miles away during something and I'll call you just to say hey and it's like so sweet but then you're also like oh my God how does it have your person like now needs more of me I mean I never got to call anyone when I was a kid know there's no way I can I run my idea remember calling like my mom at work like I would just call her up and just like ask her like a dumbass questions it didn't occur to me till right now that one day my son will call me Hey where's the remote he's gone past like the Lego games and now he's been like dead Red Dead Redemption so this is the call got like be like I'll be on on set and I'll see if only like twice so I'll be up when I pick up and be a dad again like something's wrong with the Xbox what's wrong he liked it some nevermind it's working for crowds waiting till you turned it on and you get it. Also taxes you cuz you're like you know I was there he know that you're just like whatever it doesn't matter video games haven't come up that much okay I don't think yeah I mean like I was like I haven't seen a game yet like even Red Dead We like skinning animals and I doubt there's not that much sex in it right and we're pretty open like we got shooting stuff for years yeah I remember like blowing people's heads off yeah you know in like a Mortal Kombat like sucking people spying those are really the most exciting thing was Mortal Kombat and it was the fatalities great I was like eight-years-old we working ever seen someone rip someone spying out of their body felt like doing it but never was I like how it up happened like I don't think I don't think you can grab some by the neck and rip your spine out of there maybe you can hey if you need help I don't think of unions are that much worse I think like there an industry oddly I'm sure there's like x-rated video games that week that I'm not aware of headlights not that's not even like deadly dark webs down game ever and the promise of it it's like you are its first person so you're seeing like I don't know how to describe it I'm not really a video games for some but you're like you see your hands in your thing I don't know what that means but basically you notice that something strange is going on at your neighbor's house across the way and you have to like sneak in to find out what it is and it's so innocent like you know what I mean and so funny and scary like that my kids favorite thing and it's like you're playing it and you can't tell where the neighbors you don't see him but then he gets close like the musical play a little louder and we liked and my kids just love like looking for him and waiting and then when you turn around you see this like Danny DeVito looking birds like reaching for you my kids like scream from the top of that long has the most fulfilling like experience and it's super innocent like that so I think like video games in some ways have gotten more bit better at that you know they probably great options out there yeah you know they're not I mean I'm sure there are there are other video games where you can like you know Joe a hooker or at your neighbor Nintendo switch and we almost got it for his because of this game called like overcooked 2 where you run a restaurant together it's so fucking awesome it's the best game but we prefer I love you like the new wave a video game is might be like hyper boring realism lawyer we'll be right back with your two
