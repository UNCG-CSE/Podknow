 in the NFL is going to be in the NFL every team is filled with good players if I were to put this like Ron Jaworski every NFL team has NFL players accept the dolphins not not very good but they spent the entire week hearing about Antonio Brown hearing about how they were going to suck how they had no hope their loss is a franchise anytime that happens especially before Monday night game the team's going to be motivated play like a little bit extra hard especially if you got Jon Gruden as your coach that was a team is going to beat anybody okay so with all that said how could they get you say they are going to beat anyone in that they only one by a touchdown. Kill him Joe Flacco's thinks he's thinks he's bad he shouldn't be a starting quarterback in the NFL anymore John Elway likes him cuz he's tall and throat still throws a nice-looking Ball but it's just nothing else is good problem with your flash go throw that he made when it was a wide-open guy in The Flash
 the shoulder and just made him Joe Flacco made his his wide open receiver stumble and fall because of how poorly he could hit the ball so hard she couldn't do what he has to do with Joe Flacco right when he sucks the most is about when he's about to be great the most now so he's like he's like the son he's been bad for like 5 years now and it's always darkest before the dawn you listen I know that I agree that the Raiders were extra motivated but man is Joe Flacco's think and the I don't know you got to go now he's hurt. They don't have much back on Paxton Lynch or swag swag Kelly thought about doing something different quarterback last night he was the funniest thing that he did by far as the Bears lose to Joe Flacco have a meltdown vardaan agree babe I'm going to have a smell to heaven forbid Vic fangio Revenge
 Sunday night game for going on Sunday afternoon for 25 lb live streaming I will have a meltdown person to see Joe Flacco try to do the Tom Brady quarterback sneak like get him up to the line real quick and then run like at 2 yards near us and in the announcers are losing their shit they're like this is where the 6-5 body of Flacco come so important he got like -1 yard because he can't he can't move forward Joe Flacco can do a five-step drop as clean as anybody but you asked me to do anything else he starts a fukitol that big fangio first of all it's tough when you're losing to have the belt like in the middle of your sweatshirt that was a tough luck it look like he was wearing like a mini skirt it was a weird look so you fart that's just the look that's a coordinator look he's the head coach now you got to clean it up. You got to clean it up I like Vic fangio I think he's a fantastic defensive coordinator when he kicked a field goal down 21-6 with tens 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter
 you need two touchdowns no matter what he kicked a field goal to then need two touchdowns no matter what ya Jon Gruden can count backwards from 3 is Vic fangio apparently can't sing like what I don't understand what coaches are like why are you so afraid of not getting a fourth down when kicking a field goal isn't essentially admitting defeat there it's a punch that you happen to get credit for you get free points for a big deal you got to kick off again yeah that was dumb that's a first-year coach that's a defensive coordinator move right there yeah he's going to look to your point about the the sweatshirt and the belts Aggies with his bill for cold-weather he's going to look better when he's got the big like Mike Shanahan jacket on toddler sweatshirt in and you're fine where does a real belt he had it like mid-drift somebody told me you still has the kidney stone in there like he just refused out yet how long to it it's like chuck wood
 call you get to hold on his little calcium deposit fix yes but I won more thought about this one what the NFL is doing to the Raiders is absolute bullshit I'm going to miss Oakland fans so so much the black the black hole especially like that second Monday night game that it feels like the Raiders always play it they should actually make that game in Oakland no matter what Forever Young memoriam because the Raider fans just every single shot every single camera shot to the crowd is Art it really is when you have the guy in the Chucky mask you had guys in space helmets face paint the black hole is something that you can't replicate and the NFL is robbing us of that and I'm disgusted black hole is that everyone is wearing some sort of facial disguise or helmet of some sort like its entire section of that funk that day you don't know who's under so I could be Antonio Brown you don't know but I guarantee you there
 celebrities that attended Raiders games with helmets on that you don't know it could be Riley Curry Guy Fieri eat the Stormtrooper watch the fuck a b chant like there's just something about Oakland that I feel like we're being robbed of one of the best fanbase is any yeah people say they'll travel but listen to Vegas stadium is going to be beautiful it's going to be state-of-the-art it's going to be gorgeous oh baseball field goal baseball field game having a huge shadow in the endzone to Endzone it the black hole the Broncos had a star drive from there I could even see the watch Star Wars what is it in the Death Star it's just we're losing it and I'm sad and made me sad last night I was enjoying so much
 watching that game not for the game cuz it's dunk but for the fans and critics their car he was awesome he was pretty good and then after the game he did he did the dirt car thing where he was like I love a b we're going to miss him sure yeah sure Derek Carr sure sure you are now we spend the next week saying that dirt car is a class A sure you weren't you were just a regular suntan lotion and not oiling your arms for hard. Sure Jon Gruden is your best friend in the entire world for prying that time you got hurt and sure you don't wear mascara yes sure it's not tattooed on just cuz it's on there permanently doesn't mean it's not make up having your kids literally fight each other for the first episode of Hard Knocks to show how tough the car family is wasn't totally plan sure sure your head's not a perfect sphere sure yeah sure I believe that's after the game was incredible
 just got he did the Penguin Run the black hole and he was like man man man it was great and I normally under these circumstances like you can look at owners that have moved teams in the past Stan kroenke everyone hate you know hates that guy do you have Art Modell like Mark Davis can you really hate them I don't even know if he knows we're moving now you can't hit know you can't I love Mark Davis so it's you don't even have anything you can point to and say that guy's evil Mark Davis he just wants to go where there's more pfchangs I just want Mark Davis to watch every game from the Oakland stadium in a lawn chair at Midfield would like a cooler just looking at the Jumbotron watching his team playing today on this white jeans and white shirt just covering his hands in the Cheeto dust two stadiums going to be way different I don't think the fans are going to travel from Oakland to Las Vegas
 Raider fans are everywhere I feel like in the West Coast Area because they moved from you know LA to Oklahoma taysom about football and moves they used to be in La than real quick and then bet you know back to LA I think they will still have like Raider fans it just the grimiest will be gone and when the grimiest leaves it feels we don't think there's going to be a grimy Vegas local characters in a crowd but when you go to a stadium that state-of-the-art and very new you feel a lot more out of place when you are dressed up like a fucking idiot yep yep that's really what it comes down to exactly like having if if our show our TV show that we did was on like the SportsCenter set we would have looked like assholes and felt like assholes open shot it in a basement in the back for events and it was fine if you show up somewhere it's like a dive bar you don't have to be wearing a shirt you can do whatever you want there no laws when you're drinking Claus it's this thing where if you surely Place yeah oh sorry I never truly know laws what are you drinking
 and I'm a respecter of law enforcement that's why I'll never touch a white cloth but yeah it if you go to a nice new stadium it doesn't feel the same at all just to corporate right yeah it's not the Joe Flacco sucks Bill Bryan sucks not guy. He's got he's got to be the most mediocre coach who's been around forever can we blame it on the GM the lack thereof the end of the game we should probably talk about the last past that Drew Brees completed up to get them into field-goal rain up there were given that soft cushion that Greg Williams like 7-yard could and it was a preventative since I was lying up there if the Texans had just fallen down if the Saints player just falling down and the Texans didn't touch him if there were no Texans on the field during lost all the Texans have been sucked into the giant black hole in the middle of Bill O'Brien's chin if he just fell down
 rain for 5 seconds of going up and touch them be back on the game was over know I feel like the rest of the fuk it up and give him the time out but they would have you would have went down and just called him out. That's a good point to naturally should ask if you went down and then Drew Brees was just going to come out the rest in the next Drew Brees will give him a time-out I think still bad coaching. Not before the whistle is blown. I think I would have just blown out here that would have been so ridiculous to have the game end on an officiating are put at the barn against the same you'll hear listen to interview but he tweeted it
 oh okay we'll get to that later and I interviewed Rob Gronkowski go to sleep in his bed with him he can't stop using them and it's almost like Sean Payton he has his brain where every like 5 minutes is a quoit haven't done a taysom hill play that's going to get -3 yards got to get chased him and he ran against I got out of their bill Bryan does the most I don't understand what he does I feel like he doesn't make any adjustments I feel like he does. But he does the classic thing where a guy will rip off a big Ron and then he'll make that guy run right in the line again and it's like okay well maybe he's gassed like maybe we shouldn't do this yeah he does weird stuff like that it feels like DeShaun Watson is always running for his life is always in a spot where he's going to get killed
 with that said I have a new bone to pick with Twitter something that's really been driving me nuts so off
  the people who are like Bill O'Brien is going to ruin DeShaun Watson and treat it like it is the worst thing that's ever happened and that there's never been a quarterback in the NFL has been ruined by a head coach of the Texans shut up it's they are so melodramatic about it oh my God he's being ruined guess what this happens all the time then also if the Texans had one last night comes up about stuff all the time I think we probably would be but they also gave they were again control in the first half and then it feels like any time a team like some of these gives up a second have to leave like that I'm always like what was the coach doing it halftime I did like DeAndre Hopkins suplex low that should be legal
  the boom was one of the best so I had Mann Hopkins doesn't get enough credit for one of the coolest nicknames nuke nuke is such a fucking cool nickname so when he body slammed the defender which I believe that each team should get one body Simon game just like you get one body slams I think it was worth the penalty because you suplex a guy then Defenders are less likely they will think twice before catching interception yes yeah right everybody gets one egregious penalty per game Vontaze Burfict becomes an impact player again he's a smart place that was posted Vontaze Burfict all of a sudden is like this super intelligent guy who doesn't get personal foul penalties every other game
  Romanowski gives you his stamp of approval at that point you got to say this guy knows what's it's like the opposite of smart player he is a total like I'm going to do what I'm going to hit whatever's in front of me at any point you can use those guys but I wouldn't say he's some Savvy player that knows how to like game the sister Raiders probably love now because of his history knocking a be out of that so maybe you saw that, so the only other thing I had was DeShaun Watson is unbelievable and yes all your tweets saying that the Bears draft in Mission Bay ski and so did DeShaun Watson or Patrick Mahomes I see them to hurt my feelings stop sending them please my nightmare my nightmare is both of them I might I might Jason Whitlock my account Jimmy 54-51 deleting isn't our job because you put all the money. God don't like ugly God don't like ugly
  Immortal lock the Steelers and then accidentally deleted his account it's slipped so yeah but seriously, Mt Gronk is on the show. You're going to want to watch it and chaps his eye and shops and I are going to pop a lot more if you can look at your apps directly in his red red eye I want to toss in this one extra quilt room just put this out here right now Gruden did not realize that it was his hundredths career win until after the game and have more than a hundred years or a hundred wins right yes it's hard to get a hundred wins but you actually do the math it's very hard to get 10 wins for a decade is all that's a long time just really that's true OKC win last night and he said I thought about going to Hooters and call it go out on a high note so just I just I mean just like go to Hooters and died of Corona poison a warm stool just yet climb under the table and just slowly melt lay down drown
  self in Corona and wing sauce and I don't hate that that's a football guy way to go you're not ready because you're scrolling your text messages why don't you start your people will try phobia phobia phobia phobia of phobias are like Planet so the new iPhone is out her it was debuted at the Apple right there are three cameras on the new iPhone okay so trip of phobia which I didn't know this was a thing either it's an aversion to the site of irregular patterns or clusters of small holes or bumps so because it's
  it's you don't like a triangle I hate that it's fucking people up and people are complaining that the new iPhone is insensitive to people with trip of phobia what percent of the population is actually not even officially recognized in mental disorder so a lot of self-diagnosis going out there yeah so people are being pretty extra be saying that the you don't go by and go buy an Android if you can't deal with the 3 camera the phone is so it's got three cameras because they have three different lenses totally different diameter of the Earth Pro slope which is the new thing they announced slo-mo selfies
  but like for video so Boomerang boomerang in slow-mo portrait mode I'm hacking pumped about that poop you Steve Jobs so what is the purpose of the three different lenses of two are the same age as they need they ran out of things to do or see how they shot the Matrix would like you know a million cameras on one yet by the end of the wall of cameras that you can go into the house like you own Super Soaker that you could like somebody and they wouldn't know they should make a circular sew-in 360 can pick a ball I'm still waiting for the phone to be in your ship in your pinky and your
  Thompson make calls like yes and you can just talk like a text and then that boom that's in your brain that is showing which Asians are in a branch in every time you go to sleep you just plug in your charger iPhone we have right now to 2 okay that one goes directly to Langley. Even if it's just a cut out the middleman okay other hostages ESPN they got fucking cyberbullied so hard and had to remove there they had a yellow their first down graphic like show on the down in yard it was yellow don't look like there's a flag on every single play Twitter was and every Furious they changed it halftime yeah listen don't add anything to football broadcast football broadcaster perfect I like them just the way they are I like my green zone and I like my yellow line and got shit on
  the one thing that's the one thing that you can't do is add yellow to ask or bug or allow yellow on the field in any circumstances just give me my display on the field give me my green zone give me my Genesis halftime show and I'll be happy to the Genesis halftime show it's it's nice to know I'm going to make it my mission that go ban but I think it's still Collins driving a car
  okay Lake of the Year Central roast of and he was up there Caitlyn Jenner was one of the people on the panel he went up there to the viral Clipper you just roast and Keith Caitlyn Jenner a very funny very very good Supply caches good for you on the blank of the year to have that PR type of friends you get it everything that you do a millionaire hundred times over your awesome at basketball you can shoot threes now and you're funnier than everyone happy for you is that it has pump bunkers preparing a $3000000 compound tucked away in Northern Utah hell y'all ready for the apocalypse tell ya about his apocalypse bunker

  what does it become Classic Rock 94 when do they sell those are oldies when does the 90s become classic rock hits. I think it's now I think Green Day is it is an oldies band that sucks I was thinking the album hold their albums classic rock city I think that proportionally that was like that was the album that was bought by the most people to be their first CD yes maybe the Titanic soundtrack Butthole Surfers that he made really well the song sometimes because it shows it is amazing that abandon the Butthole Surfers was able to get on the radio is vaping because there's been a real Spike and dig know but there's been a spike in vaping deaths
  so now vaping as can't turn the corner as I get into bad boy thing and I like smoking cigarettes with rebellious when we were kids cuz it's like not healthy allegedly will now vaping is into that room because it's killing people. So yeah so I think it's going to see a spike in and use awesome Michael Throne is Todd Palin because the Palin Todd and Sarah got a divorce Tampa Todd is a man on the loose right now and for a guy that had like extremely divorced dad energy even when he was married seeing him on his own single he is going to be slaying some tail you say that literally because there will be some snowmobile phuc yea there to be some people in Russia that are going to be able to watch Todd Palin fucking his ex-girlfriend from high school inside as hell yeah oh yeah it's going to be some dive bar showing up cards on the prowl

  are run poorly you want to really talk about some shit shows and then on my other cool Throne as everyone's favorite sports debate cuz Pete prisco our friend said that Bama beat the Dolphins yes let's go let's go I'm going to tell you guys something about the NFL the Dolphins are trash in Alabama can beat what's a better what's a better debate that is UConn women's basketball bad for women's basketball or which school is the real DBU by far the dumbest arguments over all the time like anyone who actually thinks that is crazy of course Bama can beat the doll flashing put on doing for twin twins from Tintin okay cuz the Patriots traded okay I'll wait for Hank to finish this tweet

  September 11th 9 8 central sets tonight only on Epix get the channel or get the app and watch NFL the grind okay here he is Rob Gronkowski okay we now welcome on a guess we should have had on a long time ago but he's here now is future hall-of-famer possibly retired but maybe coming back Rob Gronkowski possibly retired but maybe coming back I mean you are retired got to wait that you're flirting with it you have to admit that you've been throwing out little and we need you to do that for this show is that people will quote it like you need to say actually going to come back this exact probably like week 14 or something I heard that the hallway I'll present said at week 14 week 13 so you know I said I'm just going to agree with you
  week 14 or something I'm not going to ask you if you're coming back I'm just going to straight up give you a hypothetical offer right now okay you don't have to practice and here's the kicker you get to wear number 69 and you report as tackle-eligible every single play so the ref has to say reporting number 69 over the loudspeaker now that was that's a pretty good deal how many games do I have to play before the playoffs and its 4:10 Million number 69 the whole stadium will have to hear every single time every time every time yeah I think so come back a million dollars that I would take that deal how much weight have you lost cuz that's the other story is that a good or bad thing you're the type of guy
  people probably calling me weak yeah yeah yeah it's as if both it's a good I look as a great thing but people say to me like it's a bad thing to like you lost so much weight and then like like five seconds later they like realize what they sign in then they look at me now how'd you do it like I need to lose weight to like they say in like a mean way first and then they realize like what a beast I wasn't being able to lose that much weight at 260 Wiles Rd Jack so I lost 15-20 pounds and the weight I lost I call bullshit weight of a bloated weight but I let you know I got a lot of that you know I'm going to be able to be on top of your game I feel like for your whole career is you got to make adjustments throughout your career you don't see a 20 year old athlete doing the same thing as a 35 year old that right so if you want to stay in the game you got to make adjustments just like anything else
  4life I mean I didn't like the extra weight I mean I found a way that I can get it off me and I did and now I feel lighter after a quicker I feel faster I feel more energy I feel more alert and that's just the way I wanted to be did you lose anything off your bench now man I haven't I'm actually sex with her now it's making its way it's definitely, could you bench if we had a bench press in here which would have been an unbelievable moment but we don't have it yeah that would have been unbelievable moment but I actually really haven't been since I've been actually the other day after a full I just had theirs 135 on the far end times after my full workout by swear I haven't I haven't really lifted weights in like a year and a half I do like weights like every once every like 2 weeks now with the last year during the season you weren't lifting like you
  even lift now na I wasn't I was just doing more body weight band stuff you know just trying to like keep it that you don't like it what I mean is that abnormal to the rest of your career and I've been heavyweight guy late while lifting everything but like I said you got to make adjustments I feel like the heavy weight lifting was just keeping me a little stiff you know a little stiff and I didn't I didn't like it and I need I felt like I was getting stuff and I felt like I needed to do to adjust a little bit I still lift weights but I don't do as much anymore like someone is on the TV 12 majority of it is for sure it was last time you ate a tomato a tomato I mean I need to put some weight on yeah that's a prize was like that yeah I got to put some weight on side took two bites of the pizza now I'm 245 right now
  I feel bad for you because when you were playing you never got to experience the joy of having the the announcers talk about you because they would always say like the same things and it seems like every year they would add 5 or 10 lb to wait so like by the end of your you can't tackle Rob Gronkowski he's 610 and weighs 285 you know 290 you can't stop that so like when you were at your heaviest how much did you actually went my happiness I would say I've had to 70 before but I never hit 270 during the season I was like 268 some games are always range from 262 to 68 and be every night I throw my whole career before but never during football because we're big 69 fans or I should say we were I feel like the joke is kind of been run into the ground by Darren Revell recently and he ruined it by betting $0.69 on the Browns to win the Super Bowl and what is Darren gets involved in everything pleased also believe his name out cuz he'll just a hard-on
  how do we make 69 great again you know I was actually just talking about that on the right here with me and we're driving up and we were like galaxies in the past like nice crazy we were literally just saying that in the car right up here we like 69 jokes kind of faded away which they kind of have I totally 100% agree and you know how prize was looking for the 69 joke for the pizza everyone that's the problem so you know I gave him the score by a kind of had to switch it up a little bad 26.8 769 like you know cuz you just can't do a 6.9 everyone was looking for it so I don't know man I need some ideas hype hot so hot right now to go right Jacqueline with CBD stay away for a little bit and then bring it back with something like real big like your own firefest except it's cold like 69 Fest after like a year off entire
  or just the one where you check in as a tackle-eligible every single play and then I have to fight to yeah it would be you know I think 69 might need to break off a little bit and it'll just come now just come naturally yeah I'm actually back when it's forced I think that's what that's why I get my trees make him come back to him that's it yeah what's the number for missionary at 11:17 I like 66 if you if you know what I mean by we are gorgeous
  lights is born in 99 and why you standing up right and that 17 would be you're both doing handstands and somebody's going in from from about taking you from behind 99
  that would be your you're sitting
  right I guess night at 6 I don't know no 99 you're doing handstands maybe that's a crossfit workout twerkout she works as pretty good right that is to do burpees I always rated so you know just 69 jokes again just like like like a six 6:19 or 6 89 is the number that the check numbers in the middle so 46196 921 yeah that's how we always right and I was always 610-912-9012 have you what's your favorite block
  oh man my favorite block football so it's like like if I can block The dianda's Tackle lose 50 pounds heavier is going to be with me if we work together to take the Dion and go up to the linebacker do you have one in mind that you were like I kind of felt awesome yeah it was a brown last year in the playoff game vs Chargers had one in for the touchdown right there who's you guys hit no no no no I'm not a good liar yeah yeah he's a good player too real good player and myself I swear to you turn brown is actually 6 9
  we're talking like that little has he hate thing where you'd be split out and you know that's going to be combo block but you act like you're not going to block me then boom. Yes you do that too and I kind of passed route to you know you got to switch it up you can't give him the same look every time but those are my favorite is when they think you're not going out for a ride and then boom you get them it's just an advantage scrap do you like catching balls or blocking more I didn't mean to phrase it that way cuz I know I got yeah I know if I know what she means you know are you on the receiving end or the blocking it okay to stick your nose in there or are you know I'm about to go both ways and that in this category yes because going out for a pass every time I mean that's 60 plays Andrew imagine running up and down the field sissy time yeah I'm good on that
  tell you it's a it's hard work but I like switching it up because you know running password is every time that's not football. I believe in the true true style football you got to run the ball you got past the barn if you can run the ball well I believe that's why God opens a lot of times in the play action aspect of my career because we're blocking so well that when you know time goes back fakes a handoff all linebackers come up and gets me wide open that's why sometimes you saw me wide open up to see him cuz we're blocking well they scare the run so I'm I like doing both and but I would say if I had to pick one obviously I would go with receiving our friend your friend Julian Edelman said that he would often times when you guys are both going out for catches at the same time he would hear you like grunting and groaning running down the field but also laughing yes giggling while you're playing for gas at beginning my career I was always doing that I remember I remember that cousin College people keep you about my team would start imitating me like I'm running down the feeling they'd be like they'd be able to
  me laughing and then they'd be grunting and I'm going to be like and I really look like that so you would just laugh uncontrollably while you're running in or out in the middle of the and sometimes if I'm feeling good yes yeah it's amazing what was your favorite subject in school
  they're my favorite subject I would have to go with math Man math was always my subject and then one time you know in high school I got like 95 so their movements 95 out of hundreds so they move me up to you know the Vance math and I thought I was all sweet and everything I was but going home buying my family cuz my brother Chris and I'm I don't know they're smart they they know how to do they get like a is every time so I'm going home bragging so now I go to the advanced math and I swear it wasn't math anymore it was like it was no more number is it was like sound like this crate the assigns and weird yet it was like 2 weeks I just asked to go right back down to normal math just enjoy it between you and your brothers and the watt brothers who wins in like a battle royale a man that's that's a good bad I mean they're aggressive I mean they go hard 2
  that's a battle for the ages how many of them are there was five of us so I'm going to I'm going with us exactly with all your brothers were you just dominating them and in all the sports or was it pretty even it was even because I was two years younger soda made it that even so all hahaha they coming after me I would imagine the crock households growing up it was just like wrestling and playing sports 24-7 I swear we have the best neighborhood growing up dropping by like outside of suburb outside in Buffalo and we had like my brothers had like ten friends on the street I had like five friends in the street we all did and everyone would come over we would go to their house and I swear every single day it was either many sticks is your pickup basketball like around the world or it was Backyard Baseball we had the best arena backyard baseball or just be a pick-me-up
  show me a game called assume everyone would just put pillows in your shirt everyone would take a corner four of us at the same time and we run full speed into each other whoever gets knocked out knock down with with lose we got play that's what you got to do is it would just kick your ass and every single sport but actually we all everyone that grew up in that neighborhood whenever you see each other you remember that neighborhood cuz I mean it was always competitive a note is kind of always Fair because there was no such thing as a age group I feel like it was replaced if you're under 10 years old you're you're in the mix right yeah if your for your ear still there yeah yeah you're still there watching you you know hop in real quick whenever you can or if you're a whatever 10 years old
  what's the Gathering everyone that sees each other from that neighborhood with his Londonderry Lane in Getzville New York baby and I swear everyone that whenever you see another person from that neighborhood you always talk about us growing up because we had a blast what's your wing place in Buffalo you know so everyone's crazy everyone's crazy about Anchor Bar and. Swings and I would say that's more of like the tourism tourism goes are so if you ever you know I actually never been a dust in my life I've been to Anchor Bar twice as good because of the two that we like or not those really really okay but it's not that I have nothing gas on my I would say they're great but the thing is everywhere in Buffalo has great wings that's why I do know it's just that the tourism people all what you know coming in the Buffalo Anchor Bar Duff's 100% grade they have to be there in Buffalo in everyone knows about him but if you just go to any corner store any pizza joint everyone has top-notch wings
  grills gate and bar bill I never even heard of those two really horny the play I'm in I'm in highschool I never actually been out there that way the local delicate I never had Mad Dog I remember they used to always drink Mad Dog and then claim that their shit's turn red sometimes I never had mad dog and I like bananas Jubilee than yes I'm times then you go bling bling 20/20 and I turns blue on the way out so it really depends on the flavor you should try one thing I've always been curious about your career your relationship with Belichick because unlike a football level he must you must be his favorite because you are
  Hall of Famer the best to ever play the tight end position so that on that level you guys probably I would assume that get along really well then unlike your on social media and he doesn't even know what social media is like how was your relationship with Bill Belichick and how did those two things kind of come together we always have a great relationship I mean well first off I mean there's a business side of you got understand that side but outside of that whenever you see him I mean we always had a great relationship outside I feel like that's what he always liked laughed at my jokes or something was like when we are at an event yeah he would never laugh at him like at practice so you get all mad like I'll be dancing the side I'll be you know during Camp I be doing something crazy with the fans and stuff I don't think you ever really like that it but when like outside of football we were at a Vance and he sees me dancing doing whatever he's out he's always laughing at that sell he takes a serious man in the Emmys the best coach ever I mean you can just tell you know and it's just unbelievable to play for him and learn from a guy like that
  just to see everything he does but I'm over all man you know I made him laugh a few times so I had a lot of compliments a lot accomplished accomplishment did he ever sit down with you and Mike have a moment where he's like a Gronk you're the best I've ever coached no not really really never never never not like that no no I mean he's not a guy like that I mean I wish I would say he keeps everyone everyone Humboldt in there he gets everyone working hard and I mean if you do it I can give you if you do it on a consistent basis every single week he'll give you I'll give you props that that's how what is the props look like like what is a Bill Belichick compliment look like you know he'll do it he'll put you up on the screen you know she'll plays I one week and next week the next week and you know how to give you props in front of the whole team and telling you that the consistency you know the way doing things to detail the focus and I'll give you a big props for sure Ernie Adams do you know do you know what he does
  Adam says it's the man from first offer Ernie he's a mystery to every rookie I would say like my rookie year I'm always like yo who is this guy like he's on the field every day you know I know I never really met him before but he's on the field every day I walked by him all the time and it took me like 3 years to learn to Ernie Adams was and you know how big of a role he plays and everything and but now I understand he just he's just low-key and he's a beast twice a year and say hey I saw this on tape execute this at work I don't know how you know this inside info but he did pull you aside how about I suppose you decide about once a year and it gives you a tip what was that and it was about the defense about how they were going to play and how I was going to open up and get the ball that's such a patriot answer ya
  open that Play like to get ready for the ball
  and you just know they just know someday they will be deciding what Belichick's going to wear with sleeves all that shit maybe but he knows defense is like no other he draws up defenses that's what I that's one of the many things he does but he's so good at it and he just he just knows what he's doing he's ever make him laugh I bet you I was like good 69 joke you know if you ever laugh do you get when you left behind Doors Down who's your best friend playing oh you know I love when Chandler Jones was here and I always could he always taught himself you know why chronic and I was always always always known how he would call himself black drunk and I was always white Chan Thai white Chandler Jones I like yeah he was 6626 e play defense Sinai play tide on we just got along great and we're both both silly did you ever lie to me to get to be able to throw past weekend
  you know I never allow me to we tried one time about three years ago and Camp I launch it up and it got intercepted but I swear it was like whatever was dead tired the receiver stop halfway yeah I know but I think you know when I do come back week 14 it's because I'm it's because I got an arm now that we have a press conference you can go on Twitter there's something you can come here yeah pardon my take the show me different options and denouncing disease that's what you know you got to take advantage of it that's why I did I took I did I just felt like you was right to announce my retirement online I didn't feel like talking to anyone at the moment or anything and I was as I need to get this over with so it was just easier to Post online which it which was nice yeah you also announced today that you got signed by Ice shaker
  that what was that must've been tough signing considering the fact that your brother owns a company yes my brother owns a company went on Shark Tank and A-Rod and Cuban invested and you know and I know my brother asked if A-Rod would sell me the portion that he bought and and he said he said yeah and no problem in which is cool that he just asked if I would do something so I got to do a write off those invest in a fit app he asked if I could tell if he sells me dice Shaker if I'll do that if I'll be one of the coaches on the fit app so that's why I'm also getting so fat cuz I got I might have to be one of the coaches now these are you know I didn't fit app so you can fall out so I got to shoot that in like 2 months okay I'm in La so I got to do that and then I'm going on the Corp and he said that he bought off my brother which is which is really cool man he bought it for my brother and Shark Tank and I bought the piece back from him he made out pretty well to everyone made out everyone's happy which is nice and what school
  how is he let myself and my brother team up and become Partners so I work cited man when I go to Dallas I've been there about twice already this offseason we just sit there with his a videographer follows around working out running stairs biking whatever just doing promos and he puts videos together and we just post them out and that's how we made the announcement today actually we had a little video which is nice and he works hard my brother works hard and I just feel like it goes good together just you know it's at its around everything I like to do things that are you know fitness-wise in that industry that's the way I'm headed and you know what you know protein ice Shaker I love it goes great with it yeah I got a business opportunity for you I'm going to let you know right now this is going to blow your socks off you might as well just hand over like $100,000 cuz you're going to love this guy ready so I noticed that you just teamed up with a CBD company right. Yeah right there when you got you got the Shaker my idea is product code brotein all right so contained within brotein it's a post-workout drink is Scott Pelley 55 grams of protein
  real good stuff in there it's basically Four Loko cuz it's got some alcohol it's got some caffeine too and it's got CBD in there to kind of cool down your joints anti-inflammatory so it's true it's your post-workout recovery and you pre games ranked all rolled into one protein that really is brotein that is the best definition of proteins right that we have a drink that I would have to try it hands down you guys 99000 coins 99000
  are you not have been you been asked a few times from actually a couple of companies TV networks that work yeah yeah I do sound like I'm ready for TV but no no I really haven't haven't really thought about it but you know I've been asked to do a couple other things a couple TV shows and stuff and me and I have been asked to host a couple shows actually with one we actually are one with James Corbin which would be pretty dope he has is the show called League of Their Own apartment London he wants to bring it here and he does it with three other athletes in London so it's been on for 10 seasons out there so he wants to bring that here so we're at we're actually talking right now about doing that which would be pretty dope you know she only one episode a day or something hosting that you know co-host with him cuz he's he's money at that song there's a lot of opportunities out there and you know I'm just going to go with opportunities I feel alright and that I feel like we'll be fun that I feel like that would enjoy doing
  but you have to you have to go back play football yeah I know I know you know but that that's all in November week 14 that's crazy man like I can do all this other work and then I could show up week 14 and just go play football in Cohoes the TV show come on part of my take you no go to Pizza reviews do you know go do I shake a commercial go take some CBD you know you can say all goes together and then you still ready to go play so what was it did you make him laugh and half the man who made Tom Brady Eli Manning many times did you guys ever get to that point I'm sure you did but the point where he just knew exactly where you'd be anytime you needed a big-play man you saw in the Super Bowl against the Rams and in the AFC Championship game against the Chiefs when he just says he gronko get open and I'll get you like
  you guys have that kind of relationship yeah definitely I mean I feel like, as like the special power in me like he like nose is going to be open that Play like just from all the practice just from reading the guys I'm being around you know what type of Route they run that's why he loves practice so much and gets understand you know the type of receiver that he has a type of brakes that they can do and have the same time and same connection with them so that's that's what makes him so special and so I can get Sting get anyone open because he knows exactly where they're going to be so I've just always feel I always just knew that he knew when I was going to be open and he always hit me you know whenever I was what is your best bike of all time the best bike of all x o man
  good question one with the London you know that one from Chandler Jones we have night before we are in the training room and I was like you're wishing my touchdown dance because I was you know my crazy days like yeah for years all I had all that energy going on still you know I didn't mind getting yelled at whenever I did a little celebration so I did the London guards I got change of the guard in I swear that was a good one I like that one yeah that was a good method of dad the booty shaking one right after I was shaking my booty around really like your booty I would have been hilarious

  neutrasal adrenaline from that point on that basically I mean thing the thing sucked at halftime already is already blown up like that big and I had to just keep on moving and a half time just so cuz if you stop if you let it be for like 5 minutes then that stiffens up on you right away so I'll just have to keep it moving in 10 minutes after the game Steffen to write up a conversation about it but I'm sure you can relate to a lot of the you no injury rehab injury rehab cycle that you get into it mentally it must kind of drain you more than anything oh yeah drains you like crazy that injury rehab injury rehab I mean that's like the worst cycle you you can like be doing I mean I want to be injury rehab injured rehab I mean takes away your energy takes away like your joy from it all but I mean it is what it is I mean its game football though I'm right you know which is which football is amazing I mean that's why everyone loves us so much

  ran away from here long time Kohl's okay yes Kevin Durant's changing his number to 7-Eleven 7 because he says it's it stands for completion in the Bible so Katie always has some weird reasons for change.
  Like translator in the Bible that I missed know I did look it up so the number Seven Locks the number seven is featured in The Book of Revelation there's seven churches seven angels seven zero seven trumpets Seven Stars again ring chasing going to team with all the superstars and speaks of seven heavens and Muslim pilgrims walk around the Kaaba in Mecca which is Islam's most sacred site 7 times 7 equals completion that's what I don't get it I'm just his interpretation right so he's just in Buddhism illegally sourcing his material illegal yes he's plagiarizing God and download it was late and I was labeled as 7 completions but it turns out it was just a book of Revelations is mislabeled newborn Buddha Rises and take 7 steps when the new boot is born that's it right out ya baby's first traveling violation
  yeah that's called the James Harden step back I mean it's pretty obvious that it teaches seven because it rhymes with Kevin yeah 77 Duran should be that should have been to the tarantula with Jake and then we have guys on chicks horse with a PMT sport bees minute the NFL's most types of team in the Browns maybe off to a rough start but despite losing by 30 Odell Beckham still unleash the swag on the field by wearing a $350,000 Watch Me by Richard Mille watches were actually designed for women that became fashionable for Men start wearing them around the start of the first World War Z knows that his favorite Spike from his NFL career so far came during a London game back in 2012 of Bronx 91
  touchdown please confirm to have spike the ball on at least 80% of his trips to the end zone and just so we're clear vines or Gronk Spike according to Urban Dictionary Jack usually a football into the ground with tremendous force or because you're fucking hammered and felt like doing it anyway that's your PMP Sports back to you okay we finish up our show with a good friend Uncle chaps been a while I was mad at me who oh yeah I got tagged a couple times like is everything okay with you and big cat and PFT because you're never on yes
  I know it's not contagious is it contagious know but it contagious my mood is bad and I would be too and when I honestly Roan is like the nicest dude in the world but yesterday he was staying there were talking I just wanted to kill myself as he and he was like staring directly at it by but not acting like he was looking in my eyes when I first had the conversation with chaps got here I had a long conversation with him but I thought that it was something that everyone already knew about that I was late so I didn't want to be rude and bring up the I see I was thinking about the I I just did the hate chaps your eye looks great and that was the wrong thing to do. To save that shitt often I don't want to steal pirate culture like I think that in the cancel society tattoos and beard
  that with the eyepatch that's true okay so before we do guys on chicks Nick Foles injured we're even able to get excited for the Nick Foles are well to be completely honest my excitement about the next Valero was completely Fick it was fake think about Blake Bortles I thought that he was going to be a huge bust in Jacksonville where like everything was perfect for him in the eagle system he didn't have that in Jacksonville where you have probably an average maybe a little bit below I receiving Corps were the Eagles on the opposite of me wasn't elevator anybody else he was just getting the ball out on time I thought maybe we could do that in Jacksonville rely on the defense but almost any quarterbacks who that girl could do that so I think Garners going to be okay I like his accuracy he's like a poor man's Chad Pennington Sam Bradford and less of a Topher he's like more Chad than Chad Pennington there was a throw that he he
  add this week and that gave me really high hopes. Yards know it was like a 25-yard out it was a 25-yard come back and Mike Conley was on the 15 heading and turn around as a little comeback Route 9 it was as soon as he has kindly turn around and turn around 4 if that's really have that many reps and major Division 1 college football make that throw a quarterback that doesn't dress themselves properly it's a good thing for the put like Peyton Manning never put on a shirt that fit a Kyle Orton never works but it is kind of bullshit that Gardener is that level of handsome that he could make himself like put the goofiest facial hair he can wear whatever he wants to and he still looks I wish his name is something different if he was like Billy men's shoe
  seems like a y guy to feel like you should already know you have got to check how do you going to read it with your good eye okay and I want to say to everyone
  he was he was cleaning his dog's ass hole no that's not it so really gets in there what actually happened Dan is that I have been an induced pink eye a few months ago about a year-and-a-half ago I did a facial mask with mashed up banana because I had heard that it will make your skin clean website I put on Barstool Sports if you like banana Mass chaps you'll see the video I actually did it and my skin look great for like 3 days but then afterwards by I got really infected I always refused to go to the doctor with too long my I was infected for so long that now it's like a Carter Lloyd an eighth my eyelid where have to get the scar removal from a banana and has pink eye so when people are bananas here because it seems to me like you could have been anything that was mashed up that was smeared into your eyeball that would have got infected I'm watching maybe but the potassium
  bananas higher which causes a clogged duct I think she wants something about Mary when he gets all the boils on his face. Lovelace okay guys on chicks thanks to you two and Hank after listen to the podcast dear Hank said do you catch a fish with his bare hands my husband is spent every trip to the lake sitting in the back of the boat throwing Doritos into the lake play me he's Chum the waters he seemed to fish and swears he's close to grabbing one it's a waste of time and more important Doritos please stop him as it's impossible impossible if you're a bear can work at the swimming Upstream I don't think I'm going to jump out of the
  floating on the top of it this isn't a waste of time though this is just sounds like fishing like best best thing happened you got your fish you get that on video Once that's all you need to talk to me don't have to talk about a thousand times you missed right you caught a bishop a lot of fun is trying to catch a duck from the side of the boat would like a duck that swing by you know you chum the water little bit with some bread crumbs or something like that you'll never catch a doctor where there's way too quick on a day on the lake it's a lot of fun you never get if you never get your hands on this place in Florida and they had like a 8 foot platform that you can jump off into the water and I would always bring bread and thrown under the sea bream and I used to always wanted to kill the fish to bring them to the side and like basically kill its fish with my butt cheeks do you wanted to smoke
  fish with your asshole yes get a nasty taste
  all right give every fishing in that particular like conjunctivitis I honestly feel bad for the people that are going to stay in the hotel after me cuz I've been using like yeah that's worse than I usually do at a hotel with the excuse every single pillow that place to he's a Jets fan and he said he wanted to watch the game alone after they lost I texted him asking if you wanted me to come over he said no because he was too depressed I offered him a BJ to make him feel better and told me I have no sex drive right now ask when I asked when he would have you said maybe never again it's what I have to deal with for football season has a job yeah it's over it's awesome increases have you ever said no fluid have I ever said no to sex and I said no I'd rather go watch this guy just twirl twirl gym up there
  I have is after a Spartan Race but I didn't even realize the bumper sticker not on the bus I should still know that in some days in the fall your boyfriend is a Jets fan he's going to be depressed I'd say what like 7 out of 10 times 7 out of 10 10 probably more than that 9 out of 16 x 16 x
  yeah or Jacks man especially SlimKat my friend broke out with his 2.5 Year girlfriend over the summer who happens to be my friend now they fuck multiple times she's completely not over him but he doesn't think it's a big deal I don't want to pick a side but I don't know what to do
  okay so they're still kind of to get sounds like everybody's having a good time okay here's what you do you get
  you have to get a big knife and present it to him while they're fucking and be like you guys can either cut me in half and both get a half or what is How does it go song that says no I don't want although the person is getting too bad I I think knows if there is a vertical you got to go do you want his ass to present longer here's how it's going to work the guy is going to hang out with his buddy still and then if his girl that's a friend ever hit me up late night with a you up he'll go hang out with her days are for the boys nights are for the men
  nice. That accept retaking a red IR
  okay set PNP boys especially Uncle daddy chats my BF and I have been dating a little over a year and he really wants to 69 I told him we'll do it eventually but apparently that was not good enough answer he started growing out of mustache I hate mustaches and said that he'll shave as soon as we 69 but it's got to the point where I'm starting to find it amusing it how badly wants a 69 should I give in and 69 or keep holding out because nobody thinks that you can blackmail me into 60 90 okay first of all he should shave the mustache before you 69 advice I kind of like where this is at though because since it's been on the shelf for so long now it's a big thing and he's going to keep wanting it and want it so you can keep delaying when you're going to give it to him also number 7 also very specific cuz you know I mean you don't know you're probably heading maybe even just like hand-holding to really get
  heartflow and yep cuz I don't like to talk on the first date like that sometimes second date probably the first time that we're just going to do missionary I'm excited to be in a new exactly as a new Vagina, not real early and then I fall asleep really quickly doggy 6/4 was just maybe like just regular sex repeated at number three and then we have six is going to be experimental stuff new positions maybe just try to ask her if she wants to do reverse cowgirl South 7th date let's do a 69 but it's going to be with the caveat that she's on top because she's not ready for my butthole by side by side I still haven't tried that one episode that for some reason to the daughter walks in the room and just carry
  Ashley 69 in with her husband sideways and she catches him doing that I think that's probably the most traumatic thing you can see your parents doing the Lake Zurich what Jets what date number are you on with your wife we had sex while over fifteen hundred times do you have like a bedroom wall that's got tallies on it like a jail that you've been in something really special is going down for 2,000 but I will keep that for the next time I come on suddenly he wants to 69 so bad just do it because he'll come right away if you're not sickening by the first year you never going to do it and if I knew lover that's my advice to people is very very important is it
  69 is probably the most the porn category that can use the most work to it is very under representative represent it is just bubble I just like his GoPro on the Buckeye you just get from the butthole is point of view GoPro on your back facing up or what about one of those spy cams that you can just take to your forehead like right in between your eyes and that's one of the cans and the other one yet I was right on the tip of tippy top of your buttcrack facing towards your feet so just two cameras touching each other you can probably even put one on the end of a butt plug actually put it in your ass
  OMG
  in your ass cuz you need to have a good view especially Big Cat last weekend at last weekend at a wedding my boyfriend was too excited about the the band saxophone player playing Careless Whisper he pick me up slept in my head went to a column have a black eye could be so much worse can I use this against him and is Careless Whisper forever ruined
  I'd say you get to use it against him until he suffered some sort of facial injury that can blame on you I think however long it takes like I know she has a black eye on her face black eye eye for an eye in the face we shouldn't talk about ice. Hey boy got engaged and went to meet my fiance's parents for the first time when I was at their house accidentally walked I walked in on my future mother-in-law in the bathroom she was completely naked sitting on the toilet
  a man respect moving getting completely nude to use the toilet this is a time where you hope your mother-in-law not attractive like if you have like an oddly hot mother-in-law you don't want to see your tits and stuff right you don't I don't think so I don't think he's gorgeous and how do I get past this and do I tell my man about it oh yeah yeah it was a woman the number one D20 you got engaged and then the parents yeah like so maybe the Mother-in-law planted this like hey it took you this long to fucking meet us you're going to need all of us and if you should go back in time I wish that she would have just walked in and just sat on the counter in there how about this weather
  just like your son
  so the wedding with only the guys are out of the day we can we can take this out but how is your mother-in-law has the best jobs as long. Well McCartney likes to buy a call whenever so my mother-in-law had diarrhea really bad Christmas my wife makes this beautiful homemade pasta and it she makes it like twice you're so much work making homemade pasta from scratch is not an easy job so she makes it it's my favorite thing that she makes all year and she makes it kind of is like a Christmas present to me what's all on a table fresh meat boss 4
  pasta fresh sauce all that my mother-in-law comes sauntering down the stairs soon as she gets to the bottom she says well I don't believe I'll be having a nice dinner tonight on account of my diarrhea
  so is it going well I think she knows about the block because she knows I didn't think she knew anything about Barstool bright remember when Dave went on Tucker and he talked about well I saw Matt's boss on on Fox News and I'm just glad to hear that y'all won't be voting for AOC anymore I might be some in Texas we didn't have the opportunity because he was on Tucker that we are very conservative group to see like
  I really don't think she knows that much about Google but if she ever does honestly I believe that our entire family relationship will be fun I'm a because she's so Southern and Christian if she found out that I was talking about her diarrhea we're having sex with her daughter 1500 times that I've done yeah my other coworkers pissing themselves you like what kind of didn't want one side of the difference between real life and I was a joke for the internet so what's your diarrhea diarrhea so much that her browser just feeds our content like she gets alerts on her phone downloads diarrhea if she download the app and all my block come out
  having a thank you ever go listen to zero blog Thirty your podcast it is the best military podcast out there you always get great gas you're always doing like I always feel like you're doing way more important work then we are well I think that they're about 30 is a lot different because we just don't have jokes like for instance this Friday's episode we are going to have a dude who was a Green Beret retired as a general he was the very first group that went into Afghanistan after 9/11 he was a Green Beret and went in on Horseback Road in from Pakistan to Afghanistan he's going to tell you tell me who does not go download it so we can also hear month serious every night with Kate 627 chaps it's been too long hopefully won't be this long till the next time but I'm going to say it to your eye gets fixed you're not welcome back on
  engelhorn it it looks like your I like you won't have an ID year no that's there this is like haha haha and then one day he won't make us feel bad but when the attending doctor like the opthamologist had to bring in like two other doctors ever hires I don't check this out and look at this and they legitimately machine for like 45 I've never seen one like this before
  yeah milk it for all it's worth as you become a glass eye guy or would you become an eyepatch guy you know what I'm going to do is get a QR code on it where it's just we're like you skin and I'll go download perfect alright shops thanks so much thank you both love you guys
