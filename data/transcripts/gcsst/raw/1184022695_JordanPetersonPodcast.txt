Cam Jordan for more information please welcome my father dr. Jordan B Peterson thank you very much I'm very fond of this province having spent much time here I lived here when I was little kid lived in Nipawin for a good while and every go for my parents and have a cabin up at Little Bear Lake which is north of Prince Albert so I'm going up there for about a week to hide as much as I can and think for a while to be a good thing if you're talking to people about you should sink some that's a good that's a good strategy so it's a pleasure to be here and thank you all very much for coming so I'm going to briefly run through the rules in 12 rules for life I think mostly to warm myself up and maybe to summarize them a little bit and then there's one I want to concentrate on tonight that's a rule can witches be precise in your speech and I've been thinking about that a lot I started writing my next book while I started that a while back but I like I got back into it this weekend I'm elaborating on some of the ideas in that chapter in so I'm going to discuss those with you because I think it's it's important I like to use these these lectures as an opportunity to think. I think maybe that's why people enjoy them at least in part because there's actually something to be said for participating in the process of of thinking you know even if you're doing that as an audience you still part of the process see how Concepts can be formulated and communicated and maybe to some degree on the Fly you know so so so you know what you make a set of rules guidelines rules for the rules if you offer someone a set of rules one of the rules for the rules is that the rules can't contradict one another right because what good are they if one rule contradicts the other room then he can't follow both it's actually one of the pitfalls of making rules is that it's very difficult to come up with writing 12 rules for life what was originally a list of 42 Rules which I had posted on a website called Cora and if you want to see all 42 Rules you can go to court and see them then I was going to write short essays on all 42 and then I started working on them and it turned out that they weren't particularly short the essay or more needed to be said I supposed that I had originally presumed and so I think I told them down to a set of 25 and then 16 in and then 12 + there was a reason for selecting the 12 because of course I put them in a book and a book should be an integral unit right it shouldn't be it shouldn't just stuff I can consist of unrelated but that isn't what I wanted I wanted a book that had an underlying let's say what that implies play back on the stage hear what it implies is that there has to be some underlying Unity or tendency towards Unity manifesting itself and all the rules because otherwise you couldn't make something approximating a coherent narrative across all of them you couldn't string them together into a collection that made you can say that if you have a diverse array of rules or principles and they're not contradictory and they and they fit together somehow then they're pointing towards some kind of underlying unity and expression of that underline underline perhaps moral might be another way of thinking about it obviously rules for life are moral principles all principles and guidelines to both perception and action how to look at the world properly let's say and how to act in the world properly in 12 rules are up to something that's more singular but much more complicated and sophisticated something what's the 12 rules first in and make a few comments on how they're linked and then I want to talk to you about rule 10 rule can be precise in your speech and we're going to focus on that one tonight because I've got some things to think about in relationship to that rule stand up straight with your shoulders back and it's a simple rule in some sense is it talks about how to hold yourself you can say that the injunction to stand up straight with your shoulders back is weird looking looking presentable in the world my wife is a massage therapist and she's very very attuned to people's posture and she's really taught me a lot about watching people in their posture you know if you walk down the street and now maybe you won't be able to stop yourself from doing this probably a good thing you see all sorts of people who are really hunched over and found them and they're awesome sometimes Attractive people but their posture is so contorted I would say that it's it's it's it's speaks badly of them I suppose that could be spoken prevent yourself properly in the world maximize maximize what you've been given let's say the most vulnerable surfaces of our body are actually exposed unlike unlike animals that go on four legs have basically an armored back or Surface from surfaces vulnerable and exposed to the world know we do all sorts of things like that because we're very sensitive about that we're very sensitive to that course we all wear clothes and clothing is essentially human Universal very rare to find a culture extraordinary that doesn't use clothing it's very old invention and strangely enough with the other animal most of them have fur but not all of them are not aware of Their Own how about we are and so for us to stand up straight with your shoulders back is to present our vulnerability to the world and that's actually an act of Courage right because walk the Colts defensive player or two or two away let's stay from from manifesting that vulnerability in the world that's just a shrink away from life and I mean it's not surprising that you might want to shrink away from LifeLight life can be unbelievably brutal and unbelievably brutal and the fact that you might not want to confront that full body Lexie is not surprising but it's not helpful that's the thing and there's a paradoxical is a paradox in that the Deep Paradox and it's something I would say that all the 12.2 is this the willingness to confront the catastrophe of Life voluntarily is symbol taneously the what would you call it the secret to dealing with that vulnerability and transcending it at the same time and then that's a very deep truth life is tragic we make things worse because we're often malevolent but the best way to deal with that both psychologically and practically is to accept it and to expose yourself voluntarily by the way I'm not saying this lightly one of the things that clinical psychologists of all different academic Persuasions in schools of thought one of the things they've all come to agree on is that you get stronger by voluntarily exposing yourself to the obstacles in your path that frighten you I'm so that that's a very interesting concept and it's a deep concept because you don't really know where it is if you can get stronger in small Ways by exposing yourself to things that you slightly afraid of how strong could you get if you are willing to expose yourself to things that you were terrified of and the answer to that is a lot stronger than you think because it is the case that there is a potential that resides within us and I don't think this is merely metaphorically language that responds to challenge with the development of strength that's her potential let's say and that's true partly because you learn when you confront things that you don't understand that you're afraid of so you become more informed and more skillful but also because you are characterized by very deep biological cancel some of which is coded invisibly in some sense in your genetic structure and that doesn't manifest itself until you until you stress yourself voluntarily so you know if you put yourself in new situations be on you to some degree then your genes code for new proteins and make new structures in your brain and your nervous system so more of you that there's more of you than meets the eye that can still be unlocked and the way you unlock that is by requiring it to be unlocked not by wishing that it would be unlocked you have to put yourself in the situation because otherwise what's in you won't emerge that's rule one rule to is make friends with people who want the best for you and that's another pointer I would say and and it is an interesting rule I think because it requires you is to follow that rule requires you to determine what might be the best for you that's actually well that's actually a very that's an extraordinary difficult problem like what exactly is best for you what's easiest you think about you have a child if you have someone that you love and you want the best for them you don't say to them you don't say that he don't encourage them instead to take on burdens that exceed their current capability that's associated with rule one and yourself with people who want the best for you so let's make that a condition for friendship that is too make the assumption that you have something of value to bring into the world and that it's part of your ethical responsibility to situate yourself socially so they make manifest the best in you all possible ways for catastrophe in malevolence that's part and parcel of life mean it's certainly the case that you might doubt to what degree you're capable of making things better if you're doubting your own validity but is very few people don't their ability to make things worse and we can we make things really much worse no matter how bad they are there's some damn fool thing you can do and probably have to make a painful situation much more painful than it needs to be now if you're laying in bed at night feeling guilty as a relatively for people you can generate a virtual me of events in your life where you made a decision maybe that you even knew to be wrong that made a bad situation worse so to bring out the best in yourself is to at least not right it's the stop making things worse and because we can make things so much worse than they could be it's really important that you set yourself up so that you aren't inclined to make things worse and partly what that means is to be around people who would just assume that the best in you was able to manifest itself and to make that a reasonable precondition for friendship and as an obligation as a moral obligation to yourself and perhaps your friends as well rule 3 is roll to story real to with treat yourself as if you're someone I got those two confused rules to is treat yourself like you're someone responsible for helping rule 3 is make friends with the people who want the best for you to treat yourself like you're someone responsible for helping is a variant of the same idea so it's pointing in the same direction and it's predicated on the idea that well you know if you know someone if you have a family member a sibling child and parent and you care for them which hopefully you do if you're fortunate then they feel the same way about you generally speaking if you care for someone you assume that there's something about something intrinsically valuable and a relationship or bother your mother happy if you care for them but care nothing for your are not going to be the least bit they're going to worry very much about you if that's the situation that you're in control there's a reciprocity in treatment then implies that just as other people especially the people you love because that's where it's most evidence just as those people have intrinsic value then you have intrinsic value as well and if you have intrinsic value then it's incumbent on you with regard to responsibility yourself as if you someone that's worthy of help and that's a harder thing then you might think I would say you know we hear a lot about how selfish people are I don't really think that's true I think many people perhaps not most treat other people better than they treat themselves they certainly often treats her better than they treat themselves although it's good for the past I suppose it's very useful to consider yourself in the same light that you would consider someone that you cared for and also to consider that a moral obligation so that's how all those three rules point but stay in the same direction for that compare yourself to who you were yesterday not to who someone else is today the point of it all you need to have an ambition because you need to act in the world and in order tax in the world you have to direct your action in order to direct your action you have to act towards some and and in order to have an end you have to have an ambition and let you try to make the worst we already dealt with that hypothetically you trying to make things better so you have a point you're aiming at something you have an ambition and not because if you have an ambition it's certainly possible that there are other people in the world that you might compare yourself to that have gone farther in the attainment of that ambition than you, you never did leave the case no matter what dimension of value you determined to pursue the probability that there's someone out there who's better at it than you are extraordinary high and so that can lead you to become jealous and envious and bitter and that's just the start and that seems like a bad because if you're bitter and envious and that's just to start then you have all the more reason to try to make things worse instead of better you need to be able to hold an ambition in mine to give some meaning to your life to give your life a point let's say without falling prey to that terrible catastrophe of comparison that might emerge if your matching your attainment to someone else you might say well then should you compare yourself to I think this is something that you really want to figure out once you specially wants you or heading your late 20s or or or you're older than that when your urine comparing yourself to other people but it can still be better if someone more Justified because young people are more the same young people more the same than older people are as you get older you differentiate from other people you get more and more unlike other people because you've accrued your own peculiar experience and you have your own computer Hangouts and weaknesses but your strikes so you become a more singular person and as you become a more singular person because you're less comparable to other people comparing yourself on some dimension of evaluate the someone else becomes less and less worthwhile and Enterprise because you see this you know we often put certain people up in the spotlight let's say as exemplars of a certain kind of attainment they might be sports stars or they might be movie stars or two might be people who are famous for other reasons Stellar performance What would life be like if that's good fortune for Ability was ours and it's easy to imagine that be nothing but positive someone who's very good at one thing as a life that's very good across all conceivable dimensions and almost never true know if you doesn't matter who the person is regardless of their talents you don't have to scratch very far beneath the surface to see the underlying tragedy in trouble in their life and so even that kind of Stellar performances well something that we should all be appreciative of let's say but no final protection against the difficulties that are part and parcel of existence so comparing yourself to someone else is not all that helpful because what the hell do you know about them fundamentally not very much and it may be could easily be the case that if you know the whole story well there may still be elements of their life that you'd like to have for your own but you find that things were much more complex than they appear on first glance instead it makes more sense to compare yourself to the only person that you really are comparable to which is you very reasonable I think and it also quite motivating you can actually win and make progress at the same time to take stock of yourself the way you are now in the upcoming days and weeks and months or perhaps hours even you could be slightly better than you are right now and that's a fair game because you have all the advantages and disadvantages that you have so you're a good comparison and you can make real progress using yourself as a Baseline and that progress is his actual like it is possible for you to be a better person than you are right now and I would say well it's also possible to do that incrementally in in movements that aren't over there aren't overwhelming that you can in fact management I would also say this is a useful thing to know to that part of the meaning that sustains people in life through through the hard times in life is actually to be found in the meaning that manifests itself as a consequence of incremental ethical Improvement moral Improvement make a case for that but I'm a very interested in the phenomena phenomenon of meaning you know something that people experience as it is a reality because I know now and then sometimes you can be fully engaged in something that's meaningful is not really something of your choice generally speaking it's something that happens to you until meaning is a kind of instinct it's an instinct towards moral self-development as far as I can tell I'm so if you're incrementally improving in a Direction that's optimized for you then you'll find the process of incremental Improvement deeply meaningful and one of the things that's about that is that sense of engaged meaning that accompanies the movement towards a better you actually a pretty good antidote for the suffering that's intrinsic to life suffering that's for sure but you might be able to make it something that you could well perhaps celebrate that might be asking a bit much but at least tolerate or at least without bitterness and resentment philosopher said who has a why can bear any how another nice phrase and the idea is that well if the ABS efficient worth mmm the pathway there of sufficient value then the fact that it's difficult becomes acceptable and that's not something that's very much worth knowing as well compare yourself to who you were yesterday not to someone else's today that's also an injunction to humility I would say no because it is to do that also requires that you take stock of yourself and you see where you fall short which is not what I'm talking about all those that can be helpful to point out your shortfalls and sometimes they're accurate and that means they're actually doing you a favor because if you come up short in some manner then you'll pay for that as you move through life right because life is very difficult if you're not everything that you could be then there will come a time when there's so much pressure on you that the part that's missing is just what you would have needed to get through that situation and so to compare yourself to who you were yesterday and to take stock of yourself is to is to lay out your tools in your Armament in some sense into see if you're if you're ready to take on the world and it's in its full difficulty and to see where you're not yet the fish and then potentially to work on that and that's a very useful thing to do Rule 5 that's don't let your children do anything that makes you just like I like the way that that rule is phrase because it's likable although they certainly can when you were children their children you dislike and there's no reason to assume that your judgment was completely warped children that you don't like maybe they're your own children it's possible what's more common than you might think as well and it's unfortunate you don't want to let your children people that you just like because if you just like them then other people will just like something and it's actually your your job your moral obligation the point of being a parent let's say help your children determine how to manifest themselves in the world so that other people with a welcoming attitude. A properly how to share how to engage a reciprocal interaction why do you do that one so that they have friends Wright & Friends are the primary source of socialization by the way once your child is about for your the primary source of socialisation up to the age of 4 but by the time your child is 4 units are parasitic become the primary agents of socialization and so your job is to at least in part as a parent is to help your child learn how to manifest themselves in the social world so that other children are lining up to be there friends and then wherever they go they have friends and then the friends help socialize them and that makes them sophisticated and and and socially capable and all of that and that's a very good thing to have happened to your children also if your children aren't just like about let's say by adult standards let's also helpful partly because they're going to have to deal with adults and adults hold all the cards and so if your children know how to react to adult so that adults react to them properly positive child have to go out of his way or her way to be obnoxious enough to turn off an adult you know because almost everyone no matter how beat up and tough and and the dragon by the world and even resentful it's very very few people who don't have a soft spot in her heart for a child and so you can help your children determine how to intrinsic attractiveness because of their response to adults which would be improperly in open up the world to them and so that's a very and that that means that you're trying to teach your child the way of being in the world that's of maximal value to the people around them and you know there's lots of people who are going to be around your child in every one of those people is broadcasting a message to your child about how to act in the world for for optimal return let's say all things considered if you can help your child figure out how to be a good sport let's say which is a good way of thinking about it to play the game properly and you do the great favor and you helped Point them in the right direction in the world rule 6 that's set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world what's an injunction against bitterness again I would say one of the things I spent a lot of time studying people who do terrible things some of the month or carrying some of the more casual sort of of of what would you say vengeful arrogance deceitful Criminal Who does who perform dachshunds like shooting at the high school or an elementary school in in the more ripper in the even more reprehensible category and those are people who have decided that there's something fundamentally corrupt about the structure of the world itself and are out for nothing but revenge and they have their reasons generally speaking as I read a famous the point I think he said everyone has a reason for suicide and perhaps a slightly pessimistic but I don't really think it is because people's eyes are very difficult you see this when people become depressed they can think about times in their lives where the difficulty was almost insuperable and that that was enough to make some Delta validity of continuing with their own life you can go too far darker places tonight if you're if you're if you're inclined and unlucky let's say I think perhaps you have to be both and to not only doubt the value of your own life but I doubt the value of life itself or maybe even of existence itself and to become hateful and and vengeful in relationship to the structure of being it's really to aim your weapon remix God other than the better way of putting it with your religious or not there's depths of hatred properly couches at him it seems to me that instead of blaming the structure of the world for this evening inadequacies of being that it's much more appropriate as outlined let's say in rule for to take stock of your own inadequacies using your own judgment and set reviews for Christian before I judge everything that exists is it genuine that I have taken full advantage of every opportunity that has been granted to me in front of you whatever you could do with your life and whatever you could be with your limitations and your abilities and it takes tremendous effort of course to take advantage of all those opportunities and also a certain degree that you're justified in criticizing the structure of existence itself even social institutions for that matter I would say until you have done everything you possibly can to put yourself in order and it's actually an optimistic Doctrine even though I think it's carries with it a very heavy burden of responsibility because it implies that what you do in the confines of your personal life is far more important than you might think and that it actually has the same Rippling effect that a pebble in a lake and a pond has for you to either let things go in your own life and have them fall apart or to put them together and try to structure yourself properly so rule 7 pursue what is Meaningful and not what is expedient I would say that's getting closer to the point of all 12 rules I think maybe rule 7 and 8 are the ones that are most Central rule 7 is do what is Meaningful and not what is expedient since rule latest tell the truth or at least don't lie a change that it was originally tell the truth that real but then I thought well that's asking a lot because I'm like what the hell do you know what do I know very hard to tell the truth but it's not so hard not to lie even though it's plenty hard because now and then you're going to say something and you know that it's false and you say it anyway and you could not do that and that would be something and we'll return to that rules do what is Meaningful not what is expedient what are the experiences that I've had recently that's been quite common is talking to journalists who have a an agenda right at the beginning if you've noticed. Tell you a little story I was I was in London UK about 4 weeks ago and I went on this show called hard talk and our talk is being on BBC for a long time and it's actually a rather rare TV show because it allows for long-form relatively long-form dialogue instead of the 30 second sound bite you know the couple of minutes that ideas are usually discussed say on something like Broadcast News it was it was 23 minutes or half an hour with commercials living room glass table round glass table nurse monitors on the back with the logo of the show and the that started the program and he looked into the teleprompter there and he read off the introduction about how controversial I apparently am and that was all fine and then he sat down and we had what purported to be a discussion it wasn't really a discussion because I wasn't talkin to a person I was talking to corporate puppet and very carefully or maybe a marionette so I was talking to someone whose strings were being pulled from behind the scenes he had let's say twenty questions already scripted out and I'm not laying the responsibility for that precisely on him broadcast television is a very expensive medium and every minute has a tremendously High monetary value and so it isn't generally the case that broadcast television stations are just willing to let their journalist swing it right because something might go wrong so they tend to script to everything but the problem is scripting everything when you're having a conversation is that why have the conversation if you already have the script you know what's so part of what I'm trying to do when I come out and talk to all of you is to not have this scripted know I sit in the back room there before the show and I think okay well what issue am I going to address what problem am I going to try to talk about that's really the fundamental issue that's like the point of the talk right the fundamental issue and and then I think while I'm going to I'm going to try to think about that in the dresses in the spontaneous Manner and see if I can get a little farther with my thinking then I've got before and then there's something about that at least in principle is engaging and disengaging to me because I like the problem of being precise in your speech that's actually really interesting problem as far as I'm concerned it's a very very deep problem and wandering around in the space where a solution to that problem might be generated is something that's very much worthwhile doing and if I get into it and I can think about it then I'm I'm grappling with the property then I can engage all of you in the same dialogue and and we can have a I can tell when I'm talking with a note you're along for the ride you know I can tell by whether or not you're ruffling you see everyone's quiet and I listen for that because if the audience is making noise then I'm not in the right place I'm not doing what's meaningful I wandered off the path and I've lost people and so I'm not part of that instant for meeting that I was talking about earlier the fact that if you're sitting there and you're being quiet and we're all involved in 4.4 on this narrow pathway of meeting I think that's the pathway between Chaos and Order you know it's order because you understand what's happening well enough to fall to chaos because we're investigating something new and it's in the trucks to position of that Order and Chaos that meeting manifest itself because being on that border between Order and Chaos is where your secure but also developing at the same time so that's very meaningful so that journalists I kept trying to get under his kind of had a bit of a conversation before the show started and I found her back and forth a little bit and I can see who he was a little bit but there is no getting near him it's very frustrating in disjointed conversation because it wasn't a conversation it was the conversation and that's a very bad thing when you're trying to discuss things of imports because what it meant was this if you and I are talking in this is rule 9 or tell him that the person that you're listening to know something you don't if you and I are talking about something there's an assumption that in order for that to be a meaningful interaction and the Assumption has to be that it's worth while for us to both exchange our view and the only time that it's worth while for us to exchange our views as if you have something to tell me and I have something to tell you write something of value and then what we both are going to do is struggle to see if we can hit that was in our dialog wear something of value is actually being exchanged for your husband you you may have to help you may have a difficult conversation this house to be hot as you know you're you're out of think you're not in Harmony and you're misunderstanding each other or maybe you're talking tyrannize the other like it's very difficult to get that balance right but if you do then you have a meaningful conversation and if you have a meaningful conversation then you come out of it better than you went into it and that's the whole point of having a meaningful conversation is for both of the people who are engaged to come out of it why is there then they went into it and if that is happening and that's the reason you're actually quite wise in the fundamental in the fundamental structure of your psyche and you're being your psychophysiological being will tell you when you're situated in place where the information flow is maximized and it does that by engaging you in the conversation and so what the BBC interview was doing was doing what was expedient he had a plan already in mind he knew how this was going to go however I reacted more Alaska secondary what would it was already in place I would say in in a nutshell it's a terrany when you're acting out something that you have no partying and when you're the target of used I'm not complaining about this by the way I'm just observing it when you have no purchase on his nose mutuality of dialogue people do very frequently when they're communicating because they treat other people like a means to an end and they think while I've got something that I got something that I need to establish or I have to make or or something I want from the other person that's even more common more I want to justify my own Viewpoint that's another one and I'm going to impose that structure on the conversation come hell or high water and it doesn't really matter who I'm talking to and that's a big mistake because what you should be doing in conversation but I would also say in your life in general is to watch what you're doing instead and to see when it may help as meaningful in engaging and then try to just do that a lot more recommended YouTube lectures psychologist family reactions physiological reactions and conceptual Troost over-simplification let's say but Rodgers attempted to say things that made him feel congruent with himself terminology right where you say something and you can't say it without a hint of Shame creeping into your voice because you know that what you're saying is something that you're only saying to look a particular way to the people that you're talking to it's an attempt to impress yourself to yourself and people will notice that's also demonstrated by the way that you're not a psychopath cuz that's one of the characteristics of psychopaths if they don't get embarrassed and that doesn't mean if you never get embarrassed that you're a psychopath by the way I don't want you to walk out of here with that impression you want to engaged spontaneous way with the people that you're communicating with and you want to learn not to say things that make you weak and Rogers was was very emphatic about when he was talking about how to train psycho therapist is that you can learn to watch what you say or listen to what you say and then to feel it out and to think well it is again it's a sense of its almost defensive location in the in the same way that there's a location between Chaos and Order you can learn to do what it is that you're saying and you can see if whether what you're saying makes you stand up straight let's say with your shoulders back and makes you feel like you're grounded and standing on a rock instead of town or you can feel yourself coming apart at the seams to develop I would say because to begin with related this to me that if you first start doing that you may find it almost everything you say makes you feel weak which likely means that almost nothing that you say is either meaningful or true and that's enough of a shock I would say just to comprehend that that might be the case that's enough of a shock to stop people from looking any further down that road that was so so that's do the proposition did not rule do what is Meaningful not what is expedient in the proposition is that all things considered the best guy that you have in life is to note what you're doing this deeply meaningful and to do as much of that as you possibly can I would say even neurologically although a lot of this is speculation because there's so much about the brain that we don't understand me you have Untold death you know the thoughts come to rise out of you in some sense and manifest themselves in your imagination don't really know where they come from your sisters is parts of you that are very very old from an evolutionary perspective let's say they're capable of great wisdom some of that manifests itself in dreams dubstep step step temperature meaning play Jokers when you say the things that are the right things to say is an indication that this is very hard to explain but that's your you structured yourself properly so that the words that are coming out of a great depth and manifesting themselves in power and you can align yourself without you knowing it's not for nothing and no one of the central doctrines of our civilization Western Civilization isn't there something Divine about the word right and if you look at that from a Christian perspective from the Christian symbolic perspective for example the Christians I signed Divinity to the word made flesh and that actually mean something psychologically it means that there's something Divine about proper speech it means that it aligns you with the structure of being itself and I do believe that that's the case and I also think the people believe this and I'll tell you why you know about advice that you give to someone that you cared about you wouldn't say it's very unlikely unless you're bitter unless you're Twisted I would say you would not tell someone you love that the best way to make your life way through the world was to lie about everything they possibly could all right so right. Seems like that seems reasonable you might say to someone while now and then you have to tell a white lie and you might be willing to forgive someone if they do lie but the probability that you would guard lying has an admirable me it's very very light so what that means is that you go to being in the question is what why do you think that you intend to what degree do you think that and perhaps it's actually true the truth is the proper Motors being and then if it is especially if that's how you act in relationship to people that you care about thinking about proper way of manifesting yourself in the world is to ensure that every word you utter is as truthful and meaningful as you can possibly make it and if that's actually the way that everything in the world could be set as right as it could be I'll tell you something about that that's a bit of background you might be interested in last year I did a series of lectures on Genesis which became quite strangely enough and thousands of years old 3000 years old 5 thousand years old in their written form and perhaps they're twenty-five thousand years old in their spoken for and maybe older than that in fact I think they have the roots and processes that are far older than that there's this idea in Genesis which is the reason I stress this is because we have a fairly have a functional culture and that's culture is embedded in the narrative structure and the fundamental Narrative of that the fundamental body of stories that brings out there together is the carpets of biblical stories for better or worse and so if take those sorts of things seriously if you take your proposition in Genesis this is the proposition that whatever God is uses whatever the word is logos the word to generate order out of chaos chaos is something like potential in something like you face when you wake up in the morning and you think what is this expensive the day in front of me and I could do what I would with it within my range of power right so it's not like you're driven exactly like a clock is driven by its internal mechanisms and ability you can make choices about which elements have the potential are going to manifest themselves in the real world what could be and what your actions determine is what is and so it's you that's using the point that you make to write the story of the world and maybe you're doing that in your own particular idiosyncratic and relatively isolated way but that doesn't make it trivial because you can make things you can bring things into being For Better or For Worse and it might be better to bring them in to be for better rather than for works cited generator order out of it which is very very important so so it's the word that screw the word the true to generate he says repeatedly and it was good and there's a proposition proposition in the proposition is that if you confront the potential it's in front of you and you do that was truthful speech then what you produce will be good and that's something I'll tell you man you can think about that for about 10 years you'll never been never exhaust its possibilities because it's a proposition and the well we already established the fact that there's no doubt that life is Rife with suffering and and and contaminated by a certain amount of malevolence in the question is what what might you do in the face of that and answer seems to be use your words truthfully and the consequences that will be the construction that continues construction of being let's say the continued co-creation of be in as beneficial a manner as it can be conducted don't think that's a good way of proceeding in the world well then we can take the opposite of that well then the best way to proceed in the world is to tell the truth or How deep the truth is that well it might be difficult decisions that you are precisely. Which transformed the potential of the future into the actuality of the president someone does something terrible perhaps the first thing you do don't work or maybe they were brain-damaged or we're looking for limitations on that ethical responsibilities and hold ourselves accountable as well we still fundamentally in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary which will be willing to consider you are in fact responsible for the decisions that you make and you know it isn't only that we do hold each other responsible in that way we are actually want to be held responsible in that way because it's nothing more annoying than dealing with someone that way to behave in that way you can't tolerate it if someone is willing to grant you that value know if I treated you like you're completely deterministic creature and that you're not responsible for anything that you'd be impossible for us to have a relationship if you had any sense at least it would be impossible unless you were looking for complete abdication of responsibility tell the truth or at least don't lie I thought about this a lot and I saw the way you decided to live your life was to use your instinct for truth meaning to guide your actions and your perceptions let's say that you and I think by the way I think that's the fundamental manifestation of space I believe that the end you have to have faith because you don't know everything until you have to take a chance all the time right you're always leaping into the unknown and some sense and you have to do that with some what would you call it with some theory of how things work in mind and one Theory might be well we could try telling the truth and see what happens because very adventurous way of living by the way because you don't know what the hell's going to happen if you try that but it certainly won't be what you expect but it might be far better than you think even though it isn't necessarily what you want so what is the meaning of which I think is the most courageous way to ask in the world then you have to be sure that you're not any more warped then you should be because you need to rely on your instincts and you know you tell children while it's best not to lie and maybe they ask why and then you have trouble explaining it like you might have trouble explaining to your child why it doesn't matter whether you win or lose it's only matters how you play the game it sounds Preposterous on the face of it but it's certainly something that's true you say don't lie and if you're pushed you might not be able to come up with an explanation of why you shouldn't lie but here's one come what you practice actually true so when you start to develop a new skill when you first develop it and you're not very good at it it sort of all over the place parts of your brain are involved in in guiding your action while you practice that skill but as you practice it more and more and more parts of your brain that reads evil involved so it moves from the right Hemisphere and the left to the left only and then from the entire left to the back of the last into a smaller and smaller place as you pray better and better at it automatically and then that's part of you and it's permanent until you become what you practice and so then you might say what what do you become if you practice to deceive and answers that is someone that you can't rely on and that's a major catastrophe first of all here's the first part and I alluded to this before there will come a time or multiple times in your life where you have to choose a or b and it's life or death or tell if your sickness or its Sports divorce or the stability of your marriage who knows but something major is resting on it and you won't know which way to turn because it's extraordinary complex and the only thing that you'll have to rely on in that situation is your integral moral virtue got into the degrees that you've contaminated your own psychophysiological structure with automated Act of deception you won't be able to rely on your judgment and you I forgot like you can possibly imagine part of the reason freezing that lies behind say Ruel they tell the truth or at least don't lie is that if you will need to rely on yourself like it's as if you're out in the ocean in your captaining a ship and you have the rudder and there's a terrible storm and when are you make it through it is depending entirely on your skill as a sailor and you will be able to do the Orient Yourself by the stars and if you drown you and that'll be the end until part of the reason that you try not to lie is so that you don't corrupt the Instinct that you have for truth in meeting because when push comes to shove you won't have anything else in the world that can defend you against the tester for you except that you have to rely on yourself you know that you can make a terrible mistake and then if you're not up to the decision that you'll pay for it one of the things that I wanted to do when I wrote 12 rules for life and also maps of meaning which was my first book was to take some of these more some of the more profound truths that we've done what would you say to Maria at the base of our cultural construct like the story in Genesis for example and to make the link between that and what happens to you and your day-to-day life you don't want something else it's worth considering you can think about this as well in our society in the west we decided a long while back first of all in the context of our religious structures that there was something Divine about the individual now you know that's associated with the ideas of the immortality of the soul and that's something that I've not going to discuss because I don't know anything about that but it is associated as well with the idea and every person has a spark of the divine within them and that's a reflection of the idea that when God made human being he made them in his own image and the question is what does that mean but the answer is well let's go. Which uses communicative intent truthfully to generate habitable order from chaotic potential then that's what you are and I do believe that that's what you are I don't believe that but that's a complicated issue whether or not your religious or you know it's more complicated than it looks on the surface because Harry has one thing I realized about our culture a long while aback is that we all act as if that proposition is true and here's why you know we decided a long time for people to figure out the 10000 year Enterprise to figure out where sovereignty properly resided its political Authority and its competence we shouldn't use just the word power because that's a misapprehension about the structure or structures of Power are fundamentally and if they were fundamentally constructs of power than they wouldn't work because they would be nothing but tyrannies and tyrannies don't work and our societies work now they don't work perfectly you can tell that they work because everybody in this audience first of all could come here in participating discussion freely umbrella sitting here peacefully and no one's afraid for their life and the power is on and everything is peaceful and most of you will go home tonight to decent places in and have functional families and that's really quite the miracle and so you can't assume that what we live in is a tyranny of power even though every society Hills towards a certain amount of corruption our society is very functional and they're predicated on a certain view of the individual human being and political power in the war in the world with the hell are you maybe you're not even very good at what you do better at what we do when we are and we all are that regardless of our personal Bears the responsibility and the ability to be the Cornerstone of an entire civilization but at the individual level you think while you do believe that well that you're a functional participant in this society and perhaps some one of the principals although I would say that was secondary the body of laws that the direct consequence of that I would say that something even more telling than what you might say about what you believe because that's more detached from who you are as it has to be we are going to proposition that each person had sufficient value to be the Corner Stone of sovereignty itself and that's something because you were born is of the highest value it's virtually the definition of what constitutes Sovereign and it looks like the consequence of that is the production of the freest in most productive societies that have ever existed to be some sort of proof for the validity of the initial presuppositions that's part of the reason that I'm so opposed to Identity politics which I think is Napoleon game regardless of whether it's played on the left or the right to reintroduce tribal identity into are functional Society into you should be identified by your text or your sexuality Edwards your gender or your sexuality or your race or ethnicity instead of being viewed as a locus of divine sovereignty to me is a step 1 minutes that will do nothing but it always has whenever we taking that particular route rule 9 knots assume that the person you're listening to I know something you don't that what I'd say that's the size what is its sine qua non I think that's the right phrase have a decent conversation we alluded to this already you know I'm here talking to you as if what we're doing matters because I assume that we can have a conversation about important things and without that initial and maybe people important things and not only that we can have that conversation but that we could that we should have it and then it would be productive that we would do somewhere if we had that conversation as a consequence of initial hypothesis which again is a form of active space that's that's exactly what happened and so and one thing I learned is a psychotherapist to is that you know I always listen to my clients. That was something again I learned from Carl Rogers if you want to learn to listen Carl Rogers a very good person to read if you listen to people don't tell you very interesting thing tell me the truth to if you actually listen known Rodger said well you should listen to the non-judgmental way and that you should listen what would we call with unconditional positive regard never do you like that idea enough my attitude towards my participate in the conversation isn't one of unconditional positive regard it said I'm trying to set the situation up Saw the Best in Me is talking to the best in you knowing full well this is the part of me that's not the best and also a part of you that's not the best very important conversation because there's parts of them that are not working for their own in right because they wouldn't be in therapy often otherwise although sometimes people come merely because terrible things have happened to them you know through no fault of their own let's say but often they're coming because parts of them are working at cross-purposes to themselves if you don't want to have unconditional positive regard for the part of a person that's working at cross-purposes to themselves you want an unconditional positive regard for the part of the person that striving towards the point where it's driving towards the lights and then you can have a conversation without part and you can bring the part of you that's doing that as well into the conversation and then that's associated as well with that sense of Engagement meaning that I was talking about earlier I think that's a real phenomenon you know I think I think it might see I actually believe this I think it might be the most real thing there is no figuring out what's real and what isn't that. Very tricky business very difficult thing to Define know we tend to think about material reality is the most fundamental at the most fundamental reality that we don't act that way we act like pain is the most fundamental reality and that's also were thinking about because I think that you can make a very strong case that suffering is if not the most fundamental reality its way down there at the bottom and then whatever it is it can address that suffering is obviously of equal reality and one of the things that can address suffering is meaning it to him two things that can address stop ringing meaning and truth of suffering is a fundamental truths and whatever can overcome it has to be at least as fundamental and it certainly seems to be the case that the truth and meanings are good contenders for those things that might overcome suffering you seem the person that you're talking to know something you don't so you can have a conversation with some you know you can find out what peculiar things they've learned in their life something you don't know if you can have a conversation with almost anyone you know it doesn't matter what they do if if you can get beyond the expedient and you can make contact with the part of the person is moving upward they can tell you all sorts of things that will Enlighten you and that's your fault because life is very difficult and if you could be a little smarter than you are then there be a little less suffering to be had for you and your family and for perhaps for your community as well and so you should treat any opportunity for a conversation to the degree that you can managers as a place as a as an opportunity to a little bit of gold out of the sand and see if you can take that as an added to your collection and if you ended the conversation with that attitude in mind the probability that some of that will go for you during the conversation is exceptionally high and you know it's a skill that you have to develop it's not an easy thing to do it also requires that actually what you want from the conversation is something meaningful and true you knowing the truth the meaningful trees tends to strip away everything about you that isn't worthy let's say and that can be very painful so it's not self-evident that it's something you want you really want people to tell you the truth the answer to that should be us but you have any number of reasons to to be leery of that you know especially if your life is characterized by a tremendous number of falsehood rule 10 which I broke tonight by the way to be precise in your speech well I said all of these 12 rules rotated around a point so I'll see if I can shut a little bit of light on not so my daughter my granddaughter is 1 years old just one year old now and it's been interesting to watch her and learn to point B holds up her finger and she she points to things you know and that's a miracle that ability to know how complicated the world way more complicated than you can possibly imagine just have layers and layers and layers of complexity and when you point one thing that's what she's doing linguistic Behavior right before you can point because the word is a pointer to something awarded a pointer to something of value importantly it's a pointer to a way of being that's valuable because while you might want to you might want to accrue valuable things let's say so you can imagine that as a motivation but what a better motivation is is that you could exist in a manner so that the probability of a valuable things was increased and that's fundamentally the point and we all engage in this and I you can see this developing in her learning to point and she pointed thinks that she finds interesting but she's always looking at everyone else to see if they get the point and the reason she's doing that is because the specified in the world things of value that everyone else thinks are valuable to write because you're not going to have anything to communicate about or anything to trade with people or any way of making contact with people unless you specify in the world of value are also value to them what we've done is we've taken completely complex Worlds world is complex beyond our imagining and we've overlay the structure on it that says this is System of pointers has a way of thinking about it and that's what she's introducing yourself to now as well if it's that like there's a toy there is mom there's Dad very short words right there's a cat with a very short words are fundamental things of value in once she gets the point within she can mail those things with words and once she can use words and the point will then she can enter into these are the things of value in the world when you look at the world you don't really see the world this is something I'm trying to look like more clearly in my next book level is Way Beyond you what you see instead is a structure value this place on the world and we determine that structure of value by collectively determining what constitutes the point you know when the point might be the toy for the point might be some food or the point might beat her mom if she's in distress but the fundamental point for her is not any of those things that's how she should be in the world and so here's the thing that's so tricky the very very difficult think understand you have the world itself but you really can't make contact with because it's so complicated then on top of that you have a value that everyone is participating in creative and the point is at least important things of value in the world and that's very important those are the things that we naturally perceive when we were walking around in the world things of value against the background of things that have no value even though they still exist but I would have died out of that whole back from the thing about you you can extract out an ethic that's the manner in which you should conduct yourself in the world if you're going to engage most admirably with all the things of value the World As It is incomprehensible. Which is how you should ask in the world we know this to maybe I can close with this be very interested in in in in in sports as a Proto ethic are sports almost all the sports that we watched our exercises in precision I think about virtually every sport involves the same and a Target right soccer baseball basketball hockey team sports in particular that you can spell manifestation of the same thing as a reflection of our evolutionary involvement in such activities is throwing at Target and hunting the very deep part of you want to specify a Target 3% easly we want to hit it very accurately with Maximus kill we want to arrange ourselves into groups to do that and that's exactly what you do you specify gulfton arbitrary goal who the hell cares if you put a ball through hoop and the target which is something you do with precise speeches by the Target not really not really because in the old is the game you have the world and then you play the basketball game in its kind of arbitrary thank what what are you doing when you play basketball if you go through hoops like what why would you bother with that he's rather pointless has a point the point isn't to get the damn ball through the hoop the point is to be the best possible possible player right ball player you think this goes back to something when you're saying is Well of course you want to retain the AIM you want to try and strive to win if you're playing the game but winning the real winning isn't whether or not you win or lose the game the real winning is how you play while you're winning or losing the game anybody else but why is that the real winning more points you're going to play a lot of games in your life 1 basketball games basketball games basketball and soccer and hockey games cuz it's going to be a lot more games than merely the games so what you're trying to do while you're playing those games and practicing hitting the concise Target properly with your high levels of skill is to conduct yourself in the most admirable possible way while you're doing that and the burn to conduct yourself in the most admirable possible way while you're pursuing that symbolic routine trying to win the game turn yourself into the sort of person who is maximally prepared to play the best possible game across the broadest possible sack of game and that's how that emerges from the you got the world is games we play in it since the game specify the value of Steak is the ethics it comes out of the proper way of conducting yourself while you're pursuing things of value that's all tangled turn up without concept of sovereignty color of the state and Society in Harrison you can you have if you're going to fill that she's going to Fuccillo what the destiny that that responsibility places on you and it has something to do with our acting out this more complex are affected I just described if you take your place properly in society then you do it as the person who plays properly and to the degree that you are the person that plays properly recognized as part of what you are that's a better way of thinking about it then that's manifested properly and you keep the world orange proper pack now the reason I'll close with this the reason that I thought about all this for so long is that in such detail that says because I was very curious about how things go terribly wrong so I spent the last 30 years immersed in terrible thing I've spent a lot of time studying while the actions of reprehensible people as I mentioned the people who shoot up high schools and Duke and then performed on your take those sorts of mass catastrophic cruel killings especially of innocent people but but even more to the point perhaps interested in the psychology of totalitarian brutality and one of the things that I have come to realize the consequences that is the fundamental failure of the totalitarian state is not political it's psychological Party City generating to totalitarianism when the individuals who composed that Society refused to Bear the moral responsibility they have for acting as Sovereign entities carbonated the upon which the States founded and what that means is that the world goes to hell in a handbasket another consequence of your ethical errors and I don't think that there's anything that's more true than that I tried to learn what the catastrophes of the twentieth century hypothetically had to teach us because it was that we went through all that we went through event in principle we could derive from that experience the wisdom not to repeat that and as far as I can tell the proper derivation is it's on you it's on you it's on each of us thank you very much so we have all these questions so I'll read the ones that strike me as comfortable as a stay-at-home father I've never been invited Tupperware party am I being alienated because I'm a dad or do I need to host a Tupperware party first that's a funny question actually so let's take it up let's take it apart as a stay-at-home father okay well now you specified your identity so that's quite interesting stops frames the rest of the questions I'm a stay-at-home father now hard to say how you feel about that but it's interesting that you put that first that's worth thinking about second issue I've never been invited to a Tupperware party okay well for you could imagine that in your 1950s way. Might there's some there's some what would you call them do some cognitive hygiene that apply to this question if you're feeling alienated because something bad is happening to you or something good is happening to you the first thing you need to do is to analyze the situational variables now it's very much a cognitive error that people make that if something bad happens to you that it's your fault your fault right but there is such a thing of presumption of innocence even applying to yourself even though it's rather difficult and I'm not saying that you shouldn't jump to conclusions is Mandy that you've never been invited to a Tupperware party because no one has Tupperware parties anymore right now but if not that's that's that's Actuarial analysis and it's actually a reason you need to know something about Baseline to look one of the things I can do with Council people who are trying to either find a job because they're unemployed and terrified about that generally or trying to move to a new job you know because they would like to make more money or find something more fulfilling or whatever their reasons they have to move to a new town and that means they have to go through the often painful process of looking for a job and you might say God you know I sent out 20 resumes and I didn't hear back from anybody like well you know you might just be an absolute loser as a consequence of that but here's a different rate for resumes is 98% about right for you have to send out if you send those 50 resume your fundamental assumption should be that you'll only get a response to one why is that resumes are a dime-a-dozen now right because you can post them online to like a thousand places with the push of a button until most companies are drowning in resumes and the fact that you didn't get called back because your reprehensible loser in the world is set against you but it might just be that you have to put out a lot of resumes just from an Actuarial perspective before you're going to get the single head videos you only need one hit you know you get the job maybe you need three because if you're in the car for a while maybe it'll take you three interviews before you get the job so you know I've dealt with people who are out looking for working we put together a plan it's like okay you want to improve your career while assume that's going to be a two-year job every day for the next two years may be the consequence of that if you'll come out by the end of it you'll have to wait you make twice as much money and I think every time I've tried that with a client I think that's working sometimes it worked a hell of a lot better than merely having them double their salary but it's a real brinded you have to you have to accustom yourself to the fact that the default is failure and that's the truth about everything right most new businesses go under in the first year hardly any books that people write get published not to mention screenplays menus Michael just give up on that accept it now and then someone actually manages it and miraculously enough almost everything that you do is Destin to failure but that doesn't have that much to do with you something but not that much you know you have to know the Actuarial so then I would say as a stay-at-home father first things you can do determinism is there actually any Tupperware parties in your neighborhood and the answer is no 7 has nothing to do with you being a stay-at-home father don't play politics with the temper Ware party or do I need to host a Tupperware party first there you go there for a favor I got a big favor but it's a little favor so that they can feel good grabbing it to you and so that now you owe them a favor because that's a good way to get the reciprocal reciprocal social interactions today is 3 smart idea you don't because by asking someone for something small then you would be able them to manifest Goodwill towards you and they're usually pretty happy about that and then you get to return the favor and then they can see that you're the sort of person who remembers favors and returns them and stuff a good way of facilitating trust and so yeah that's what I would recommend so what are your thoughts on the hookup culture created by modern dating apps I can tell you some some fast people in stable monogamous relationships report the highest levels of sexual satisfaction so that's the first thing to know the second thing to know you know I don't think we've had an intelligent conversation about sexual Morality In our culture probably since the invention of the birth control pills that's about 50 years surprising because the birth control pill with such a absolutely staggering technological Revolution that will probably never recover from it and I've often thought that the 20th century will be remembered for three things hydrogen bomb birth control pill transistor are free revolution of incalculable magnitude and so the sake of reliable birth control early comparatively reliable birth control has really permanently change the relationships between men and women and our attitudes towards sexuality in general and all of that then it'll take how long to adapt to that is it going to be today after mouth of the birth control pill who is the idea that sex could now be decontextualized I would say first of all I could occur without in the absence of permanent relationship and then that would be an okay thing and that it could also be something that could be done casually for recreation and without guilt I don't think any of those things are true I don't think there's any evidence that they're true I think they're dangerous delusions actually I think hookup culture is predicated on the idea that you can detach sexuality from everything else emotions what's a responsibility consideration even what sexuality is too casual pleasure and I don't think you could do that I don't think you can reduce casual sexuality to Casual pleasure without reducing the person that you're having sex with two nothing but the provider of casual pleasure whatever you do to someone else you do to yourself and never to bleed because when you're engaging with someone else you're engaging with the human being and the manner in which you treat another human being expands to Encompass your relationship to yourself it isn't obvious to me that the most compelling and meaningful and truthful story about what a person is is a source of casual sexual pleasure and I think that if you engage in a string of relationships like that that definitely come to see people like that because how could you not one of the truths that psychologists have uncovered there aren't that many of them but this is one of them but hard to uncover truth is that you tend to justify what you do something to be very wary of because perhaps you have your ethical qualms about doing something but you do it two or three dozen times and you can be absolutely certain that as a consequence of doing that many number of times that you will now formulated story that you tell yourself and other people and will also come to believe Hawaii doing that it's not only okay that's good so let's say you have 50 casual sexual partner I don't know if there's anything more or anything deeper or more profound that you can do with someone else then engage in sex with the most profound and transform it into the most dispensable entity that's what you done to yourself and other people and I don't think that's a very good idea I think that I believe that fractionated lower than the nuclear family without big trouble I think that people are a lot better off not necessarily happier but I don't think Happy's the right Hallmark of the evaluation anyways I think that people have deeper and more meaningful lives if they do a monogamous relationship that's enforced monogamy by the way for those of you that were wondering moral Universal by the way it works every culture tends towards the promotion of monogamous social structures even though that's becoming unpopular view among people who who knows the mom who people who are looking for I don't even know what to say about that it's so absolutely clueless it's much better for people to commit to something it's even survives and enriches our lives and it means that you've taken on the responsibility of another person as if they were as much a part of you as you are and that's actually good for you it's hard but it's good for you this is what's so surprising it's also what people want cheap entertainment Plexi movies cheap movies action movies right over Hero Stories one person against the malevolence in the world. the romances two people painfully isolated find each other and make it work everybody wants her deeply not everyone the vast majority of people want a stable reliable caring prominent monogamous relationship that's their desire and if you ask contrary to that but that's what you want then you act contrary to it and then you won't get it I think it's 30% of people under 29 now are in a stable long-term monogamous relationship I might be right wrong about that I just read it the other day but it was some dreadfully low number I don't think that's good it looks to me like it means the people are growing up as fast as they need to hit means that there to decide to build something stable economically and morally and practically in and they have a platform established so that you can bring children into the world so that you have life in your life when you're 50 and older let's say were were very foolish about such sort of things and I think trading all that for hookup culture is a big mistake that's what it looks like to me so I guess that's the answer to that question what advice do you have for parents of young adults attended Canadian universities to prevent their indoctrination by those bias left-wing institutions concentrate on the Sciences my discipline is psychology and psychology sort of spans the gamut from sociology to biology and the closer it reaches towards biology the more reliable it is so the Sciences so far have been relatively immune to postmodern undermining although I'm not optimistic that that will last but at the moment. So if the discipline lacks grounding in science then beware of it I don't say that with any pleasure I found the most mid what I loved about University when I was a student I took a lot of science courses and my my clinical PhD was very biologically-based Grandma space General biology I love the humanities courses literature and social sciences and the fact that they've become corrupt is absolutely no it's not something that brings me any pleasure at all the purpose of the humanities is in part to teach you how to be how to be a good person and that's of crucial importance is not something that you can learn from a scientific education although you can learn a certain respect for the truth and and and the ability to think critically and I know things are not trivial and you can acquire useful skills but it's the humanities that made citizens and so the loss of their the Integrity of the humanities astrophe bottom but there we are that's the situation at the moment. Diversity have a value in competency hierarchies depends on how you define it is it diversity by group identity no no oh it's so deeply wrong that it's almost impossible to know where to start why would we presume the people first question is every person belongs to a very large number of potential groups so okay which groups sex all right how many Sexes how many are there are there two other three are there 70 so I can people who are telling us to Value diversity aren't helping us out how do you know when your workplace is sufficiently diverse from the perspective of of gender what would it matches the population distribution and so and that's just one dimension X there is a new standard because those are those are separate apparently even though they are aligned in like 99.97% so they're not really separate race well what races are those two races has more genetic diversity in Africa than there is in the rest of the world like almost black people and what about that what about the Caucasians or are they are they all the same or do we need to fragment them into the different identity groups are the Irish and Italians to say or even White you're always a rude thing to say but my point is quite is quite straightforward and not is the definition of those racial divides change dramatically across time and what the canonical group identities are well-versed number of ways to subdivide people into groups or where you going to stop and answer is well if you're an activist you never going to stop because if you stopped and it would be a career for you as an activist. when there was no logical place to start Otis talk to begin with if you have a hierarchy in the hierarchy is it too late to add in the end a competency hierarchy is it mean if you have a plumbing business it's a hierarchy in all likelihood that sustaining the plumbing business generating some prophets and doing some Plumbing right over the fundamental hierarchy what you want to do if you want to hire people who can make the plumbing business North identical in any way with these group identities the question does diversity have a value incompetence hurricanes well what do you mean by diversity that's the question you think well that's a minor part of the questions like no it's not it's the entire part of the question I think this at the bottom of this diversity inclusivity equity nonsense is a true hatred for competence that's what I think driving is we can undermine the idea of confidence by making the assumption that everything is about power and the power is arbitrary so that everyone who has attained any stature above the lowest position in any Dimension whatsoever is immediately suspect for the game and it's in my estimation your perspectives is obviously struck a nerve that resonates far and wide why are you why now what void in our society has your messaging being able to address okay your prospective obviously struck a nerve that resonates far and wide yes that's certainly seems to be the case that I talk to you guys about little earlier you know when when you're trying to ask question about why something is happening to you you know you want to depersonalize it to begin with so I thought a lot about that part of what's happened to me is a consequence of the technological Revolution right so online video and podcasts are a technological Revolution and not a trivial one because YouTube and podcast have made the spoken word as permanent and accessible as the written word and that's never happened before in the entire course of human history right exactly the medium is the message before in order to speak to a very large number of people you had to write an even then that was very limited limited did not writing because most people don't read minority taste even among the people who read very few people leave serious things and even a smaller fraction of them actually by books never been anything but a real minority taste but lots of people can listen so I'm an early adopter of a revolutionary technology so that's part of the reason that that it's me it's because I happen to be an early adopter of revolutionary technology so as far as I can tell it's relevant in terms of content rather than form is that I've been able to make a compelling case for the relationship between responsibility and meaning both of those things are important first we've had a conversation about rights for way too long and you can't have a conversation about rights without opening up a void on the responsibility because your rights are my responsibility until whenever we have a discussion about right and we don't have a discussion about responsibility then we need half of the issue on address and that sort of hangs there as a form of talk to people about responsibility that most of the meaning that you experience in your life most of the necessary meaning to keep you away from the abyss in the totalitarian to be found in the voluntary adoption like I tell people that I said I've spoken to about 200,000 people before we took everything apart in this postmodern way everyone just part of the normal course of Affairs no one had to articulated pretty lost the nameless may be attracted by the blandishments of there alright or perhaps the laughed because of that emptiness and I decided to develop position for my life and to try to adopt some responsibility and tell the truth and things are a lot better for me now and you know what most of the people that I talk to who want to talk to me about 3 to tell so nothing important that's an important story and so I think that's the void and the void is the right word because without knowledge relationship between responsibility and meaning the Baseline conditions of Life the Baseline condition of life is suffering and if you're suffering and avoid it's not tolerable you torture yourself to death in murderousness it's not acceptable you need that meaning it's not often so I think that's the void all right what are my thoughts on the removal of historical monuments within Canada in the US BG the removal of join a McDonald statue this week in Victoria I know I mentioned earlier tonight that are something that's worth knowing I suppose you know the Marxist I criticized the West basically as a consequence of the inequality that the West has produced Capital Cruise tends to accrue in the hands of a smaller and smaller number of people that's Karl Marx's observation of Genius it's like that actually happens to be true but it's true in a more complex way than marks newer was willing to admit and it's also sword of truth what is true in that at any given time most of the world's money is owned is in the hands of a disproportionately small number of people it's not true in that those people are tends to transform pretty rapidly so would like a Fortune 500 company tends to last for about 30 years and a familial Fortune tends to disintegrate within 3 generations so although there is a permanent curl in your sink when the water goes out the spiral stays but the water is always different and that's part of the case with the 1% is the 1% always there but it's not always the same people really important I think your probability of being in the top 1% for at least a year and your life is something like 10% so there's a fair bit of Mobility but even more importantly every society produces inequality and the problem with the damn Marxist is it the Damned Marxist to be more precise is that they lay in a quality at the feed the Western capitalism and not seriously wrong episode of a tribute to the Western capitalism is wrong capitalist countries to produce inequality but every single society that human beings have ever produced and the vast majority of Social Animal societies are hierarchical and produce quality we don't know how to eliminate it one thing you can say about the web so is that we produced a fair bit of wealth and well-being along with the inequality so you might say well there's no shortage of reprehensible behavior in the history of Western Civilization it's like hey there enough and maybe you can lay some of that at the feet of the people who founded our country but for fallible human beings operating within our constraints talking about art necessarily Floyd systems with done pretty bloody well and we should remember that it's all along with the historical criticism there should be a fair Levin of gratitude for everything that we have and everything that the people who came before us created what one of the things that I find I would say contemptible about the modern University is its lack of gratitude and I think a lot of that the consequence of profound historical ignorance you know the history is one bloody nightmare there are very very few shining pockets of Illumination and one of them I would say something that really shines is the English common law tradition has a bloody miracle and where its beneficiaries and we should have a little gratitude for it so that's all thank you very much for coming what's appreciated she found this conversation meaningful he might take about picking up Dad's
