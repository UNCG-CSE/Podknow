hi I'm Craig Mazin creator of the HBO and Sky miniseries Chernobyl this is a follow-up podcast to the podcast that we did for the series and it is going to be a terrific discussion between myself and again Peter Sagal and we're can also be joined by Jared Harris who portrayed Valerio gossip on the series but before we begin that conversation I have a little prologue to add because current events have taken a strange turn and a reminiscent turn lately I'm talking about a nuclear explosion that happened in Russia in just a few days before I'm recording the snow on August 8th 5 nuclear specialist employed by rasa Tom which is Russia's State atomic energy company as well as to military personnel were killed there were killed in an explosion at a military test site in Northern Russia the Nebraska missile test siteWe Believe here in the United States that this explosion involved a new kind of cruise missile that Putin is particularly proud of this cruise missile apparently can reach any corner of the Earth because it is not a typical missile that's powered by liquid fuel like a normal rocket it's a Christmas old that is powered by a small nuclear reactor exploded did not confirm that anyone died until Saturday August 10th so two days go by before they say anything about anyone died and it's not until August 11th three days after the explosion that they come out and admit that it was nuclear in nature the words they used in these are fascinating is that the failure occurred in quote an isotope power source for liquid-fueled rocket enginewell isotope power source means nuclear reactor so what happens next well we're trying to Cobble it all together because the Russian government has not been particularly forthcoming we do know that in the city of several events which is about 20 miles away from the missile test site that someone detected a rise in background radiation even Russian news media recorded that that radiation level had gone up briefly to at least 200 times normal background levels not to put that in context that's not why you're getting upwards of seven thousand times background levels but it's still not good and then the reports sort of began to disappear there was a regional news site that states that victims of the accidents were not told that they may have suffered from radiation injuries nor were the doctors and nurses told who were treating those people after treating them apparently therooms that they were treated in were sealed and doctors were sent to the capital for medical evaluations does any of this sound sickly familiar the point isn't that accident should never happen again the point is that when they do it is incumbent upon governments and people to be as open and transparent about them as possible Chernobyl happened 33 years ago and here we are just a week later and there has been a nuclear explosion in Russia that we were told about days later and there's a town called you and Alexa which was told to evacuate and then were told her not evacuating so we're not quite sure and there are doctors whose medical scrubs apparently have been sitting dosimeter is Click because they are contaminatedthat's what we know that's all they told us hopefully this doesn't lead to more deaths it's terribly sad that scientists are still dying it's terribly sad that First Responders are still dying and it is my great hope that after this incident and maybe a little way because of our show people finally demand that their governments telling the truth and I have high hopes that people in Russia who are currently protesting mr. Putin's government demand answers this can't keep going on 33 years ago and today seems like not much has changednow on with the show especially got so if you mean to suggest the Soviets State and somehow responsible for what happened that I must warn you you are treading on dangerous ground ground right now because of our secrets and lies that practically what the sinus when the truth the things we we lian-li until we can no longer remember this even there but it is still there hi this is Peter Sagal sometimes known as the host of wait wait don't tell me from NPR but more recently and got to finally known as the host of the Chernobyl podcast originally produced with myself and the show's Creator Craig Mazin to accompany each episode of the HBO miniseries well some months after the extraordinary success of that miniseries we have gotten the band together for a special After Effects episode of this podcast Craig Mazin how are you I'm good mr. Peter Sagal how are you I'm well thank you I've been enjoying all the undue attention I've been getting for being on this podcast we are also joined and I am extraordinary excited by this by the leading actor of the miniseries who played the gossip to such extraordinary effect Jared Harris is doing is Jared hello hi is anybody who has seen the miniseries or even has just been watching the press that the miniseries kind of took over the national and international Cub station in the way that even though I was a tremendous a mayor of the show was was frankly surprised by I mean it's not shall we say what you'd expect for popular entertainment so I wanted to start by asking you Craig and you Jared it if if you were at all surprised by the extraordinary response to this television show you guys made Jared were you surprised I was surprised. It's so I knew it was amazing in my dreams they want exactly. The way I dreamt it know you could you never know what people are going to be thinking about 18 months in the future and it felt to me as though it arrived at the perfect moment and it ended part of a compensation part of the Zeitgeist and it was it's sort of started to articulate what was on people's minds if they just shifted their that gays just to in off the screen into the real world can you guys talk about any of this specific interactions are reactions you've heard from viewers of the show that stood out for you and he he was a Ukrainian and he was saying that you thank you thank you Jesus for making the show and for bringing the world's attention to that story that someone out of tca's Who's Who flagged the Ukraine and fled the phone out so he has a lot of personal stories that people come up to your neck grateful. For the story having mean told in full the focus that Craig brought to the the heroism in the sacrifice that had gone on recorded and they hadn't been recognized in their own country at the time there was a guy on Twitter named Slava malamud who says that he grew up in the Ukraine I now live in America and he and he pushed it extraordinary reviews of each episode just talking about the extraordinary accuracy of everything to pick did he talked about the clothing he talked about it down to the pins worn in the party officials suits to the wall decorations threads were fascinating and by the way I learned things that I didn't know because you know I'm not aware of every single tiny choice at the production Department makes so when when he says oh my gosh they actually knew to put the wedding ring for Emily Watson's character on her right hand because that's how it was worn as puts the left hand or look the not only is the license plate on his car accurate to being part of Soviet Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic but they even got the the region code right well I didn't know that so I just started thinking why you know what our guys did a great job I mean they really did there is a there's a word that I guess in Russian translate stew cranberries but what it means essentially is it's like a fake romanticisation of Russian stuff you know so cranberries are if if you make a movie about Soviets and they're all out of nowhere in those Pat's even when it's not good old do you know it's like that that that silly stuff in and we were we were rather cranberry free according to most people that spoke with us and there's a lot of surprises we got it right because they have seen the west and by the way they must have seen their own media in Russia princess which is State generally state-run as they funded they seen a lot of people get it wrong and I think they were surprised that someone kind of got it right one of my favorite things that he went on about was one of the characters in episode 4 in with a liquid wish you were taking care of the dogs he talked about that the Georgian character and and how that actor actually managed to actually get across not just the physicality but like the actual nature like the soul of a Georgian and I was like so amazed by how impressed he was by that accuracy but some of it is tailoring a part to an actor so the actor they're playing Bocce as far as far as who was born and grew up in Lebanon and then move to Sweden so he is Swedish Lebanese or let any Swedish however you want to mix it up and so when we cast him I change that part that part was originally written to be a Ukrainian actually and because of forests physicality and his appearance I want it was also a great opportunity for us to represent the different parts of the Soviet Union we think of the Soviet Union is Russia and you don't certainly by land and population it was majority Russian and then you have Ukraine and Belarus Witcher even closer to Europe and Russia but you have all this Asia Minor area and have all these interesting other republics that aren't so you know blonde hair blue-eyed white people there there there's a certain ethnicity that's going on if it's fascinating and so we kind of just Taylor time we tell his name is but the Soviet missive him that's something that Johan worked really hard with with everyone I mean I'm sure Jared you know right off the bat when you were talking with your honey probably immediately started in with the what he would call the Soviet weight yeah my recollection of those conversations was well that was at that was a movement the person that we we Skyped with but also something of a on the playing in the background of a deadpan quality rather than that sort of we didn't wear your heart on your sleeve and you weren't described in situations that you were in and from the performance point of the Ya-Ya Jared so tell me exactly what a movement person is we had a coach who was going to teach us something to the physical behaviors that were emblematic of all the people from that society and it was a sudden will way that they carried in some of the things that I remember mostly was the way they know that when we not an agreement it's from it's a downward motion but when they ignored his agreement it's up with like that and that's the one the big one I remember the door say the sudden kind of like a Buster Keaton quality in your face will you don't give anything away you'll you're concealing your emotions and your reactions in which is that's interesting cuz my brother expects that when you start to play a scene that way you're going to get the direction what are you doing I need to see what's going on inside your car into but you know how it was completely the opposite he was always and he was about the stakes are high enough for me you know you can hold it as much energy card and make us look to see what's going on one of my favorite moments is I believe it's the sea in the beginning of episode 4 Ludmila has arrived in this new apartment that they've given her in Kiev and there is a landlady that's essentially your building manager that showing her the the room and and she is a she said she's an Eastern European actor and she's holding her cigarette and just standing there and then we know what's back at her Jessie Buckley turns back and then just goes like meuser cigarette like I'm tired of staying here and just walks away it's perfect and I don't think any British or American person would have ever done that naturally it's just this kind of I'm done here and walk away loved it Jeremy we haven't had the pleasure of having you on this particular podcast before so let me ask you if you can to talk about how you approach the roll every actor prepares in a different way how did you start with Le gossip start with a script read that and then go off on a journey research and I menu eventually outfits from. Come back to the script pull the script to pot which is probably really annoying cuz then you start asking questions and then you so to figure out why it's being put together the way it's been put together and alcoves Craig is done that Journey himself the years ago and he's understands why this thing part about that is the things the choice is not one made as a price of the ones that were made because of obviously he went through the whole process himself so when you are you understand why things are the way they are where they are specific way then you understand you places trying to start the story you were supposed to Tallow cuz you you are a one strand of the whole canvas and you need to understand what's your responsibilities what story are you telling you mentioned like there were things that didn't happen or things that weren't there what are the things that occurred to me is it is this is not always a very heroic character for example I mean like there places where he could have done something Brave or said something more truthful but didn't the things that appealed to me as we started to do it about this about the role was that he was a reluctant hero he was not somebody who is well for example the heroes in the first episode of the traditional here I said the First Responders who go towards danger and he's not one of those people I need never didn't make that choice in his life and he never thought he was going to have to be plus when he got dropped into that situation he's still it's not a choice he can't leave but he's aware of the of the thought that was staying means come late so his journey towards being a hero is a vagina if you like and I I like the idea of he was afraid he was afraid because he understood I returned while the consequences were home just remaining there and I will serve them at a certain point trying to subvert The Narrative there are moments in the miniseries where like I suppose you say x out of fear or even acts dishonestly for example the scene where they're asking for the volunteers who would become the divers to go in there and go down there and and the scene begins and this is a brave choice I think by Craig to have the hear all the gossip set up and basically lie to these guys I got a stipend of 400 rubles and for those of you working in reactants into promotions why are ranches wanted to still operating a tool my friend is a security guard at nights and she's not dying and we will had about a fireman and now you want us to swim underneath a bone and Grant. I don't have an exact number don't need an exact number to know if it'll kill us but you can't even tell us. Sterling should have been making not spoil his car to should it be making that speech. He's had the wind knocked out of them by me turning in. We're going to be died in five years he's being sidelined at that point and I'm doing a really bad job of of lying to these people and a token to them and he steps up how close he understands who these people do you have to tell them the truth so you tell them the truth probably not something that he's familiar with this ring I that because the other party official he would be along the lines of that is the property fishing in the first episode with Jay said he not cut the phone lines and contain the spread of information so good he suddenly he steps forward into that situation details of what they need to hear so that they can make a dignified choice at that point why should we do this waffle hundred rubles don't do it because it must be done do it cuz nobody else can if you don't marry this will die I did tell me that's not enough I won't believe you well this is this is one of the reasons why Jared is so good at what he does he doesn't just interrogating understand his own character you also is interrogating understanding the characters that are in the scene with him because that that informs what you're doing and how you're supposed to do it you see to me character is not in isolation character only exist in relationship and what's what I love when we are cutting these things together is finding those moments in this is where you are and I I think we just had a lovely philosophical convergence we feel the same way that these moments are best delivered in reactions and Jared would do these things just beautifully all the time you could see him looking at Stalin and going thank thank God he's doing this but also oh oh I'm starting to understand something about him as a human being and my relationship to him is now changed because it was I'm going to throw you out of this helicopter and now it's something else I'm seeing a human in there that actually is quite Noble and there's a beauty to this man he is not what I thought he was and that is the beginning that moment right there is the beginning of their friendship Jared I will have two more questions for you and obviously when he whatever else you have to say the first is rather specific the second is larger in in the final episode you deliver the most extraordinary Li lengthy and detailed text a logical a lot of exposition about very complicated technical aspects and Craig already knows that I think it's remarkably successful but I wanted to ask how much of a challenge you found that seemed that the courtroom scene then why am I see that there was more but it got some of that got cut out cuz it was a it was a it was probably about two and a half pages longer wasn't it I mean we I had been kind of beating it up from the point of view of just being terrified of the amount we were showing the audience and demanding their attention for but also you know just kind of undersold a little bit earlier his process with a screw because you know he and I had a series of conversations before we started shooting that were really influential particularly on the the way that episode 4 turned into five and how episode 5 worked dramatically in terms of what the stakes were and what his goals were and how that was going to function and and some really significant changes came out of that and then just going through there was a very careful examination of look it's an enormous amount we had to figure an unfortunately because the way our schedule worked in terms of both availability and budget that week that so the one thing that yard is like please put the child the end of the schedule and our scheduling people came back inside the only way we are going to be able to make this show for this amount of money is if that trial is on week 3 and so you know on the weeks before it will all the giant Kramden scenes of all the exposition is ralsei wasn't like while I can still have I can curse through the first two weeks and then I can spend that time figuring out what's going to happen now I know that didn't answer so she'll be able to talk for 10 minutes about Xenon is an actor's dream or an actor's nightmare I mean to answer your question the challenge the specific challenge of this part was a tremendous amount of explaining that he had to do in many many scenes I'm the largest example event was at the site five under a mounted to a 24-page monologue and then I'll be MK react to of the type used in Chernobyl there's something called a positive void coefficient what does that mean it means that the most steam present within the system the higher the reactivity which means more kids which means most team which means shoe repair we we have a vicious cycle on our hands how do you make that interesting happening how did how is that more than just on conveying information because that's boring to watch to the biggest challenge of playing the part was a defining assertive subtextual Journey or narrative so I was playing something else other than his information and some of it was planned but a lot of it we discovered in the room and that I'm at some of it comes from it was in Craig's script so for example in that first but it was only cranks crap but for example all of the scene in the Kremlin why he's having to explain why he feels that the situations worse than it is and Craig had written that he describes the protons has been every atom of u-235 is like a bullet traveling at nearly the speed of light penetrating everything in its path words metal concrete Flash every gram of u-235 holds over a billion trillion of these bullet that's in one gram of Chernobyl holds over 3 million grams and right now it is on fire so then you look a lot and you think of why does he why does he use that word and then you I understand the Crags mind was in that was okay he's in a room full of people that if I start describe a didn't scientific terms are going to lose them and they went on to Stein I need to explain this in a language that they do understand the language that they understand its bullets in the back of the head and but he only discovers that at that moment you know so that's useful because you can plan that that's all the stuff that you can plan that that was versions of it. We did that was very passionate and I think the one that they use that I like was when he gets carried away and then he suddenly realizes the room that he's in. He got scared and he calls himself back because he understands who he's talking to I need pools in South against himself under control so either you look for little things like that within with a big Naruto are you having to explain stop and then specifically in that last courtroom scene Craig and set the whole thing up so we're watching it going is he going to do it is he going to tell the truth I'm at all so that that you're hiding Craig's approach to that scene in the way it was structured was they didn't want it to end up with a a giant soda and justice for all Al Pacino it kind of looks like a balloon losing its Eric's fault at the end that day when I was gone for days out this thing before them and that's just no response at all and it was a futile gesture that at the end of the day you can look out and say what why would you ever think this could work out. That's exactly right I mean that every chance we could we try to avoid doing what it seemed 70 years of Television that Todd has to do and ending a trial with an utter failure I mean just an utter failure is interesting in itself and also I think very Soviet the history of people making Brave stances and ending up with ice picks to the back of her head is pretty long and glorious and he tries something they're out of just a sheer Devotion to principle and its tails and only then threw that failure I think do you imply that lagasa gets the idea of what he's going to eventually need to do but there's only really one way to win and going through everything that we did for the inside the Kremlin and certainly at the trial it was always about trying to figure out what this explanation meant to the gossip is he was telling it it was through the lens of his contempt and outrage for. Levin what he in the decisions he had made it is also sometimes powered by his love of the science itself I mean when he starts talking about the nuclear reactor you see him getting lost in the thing that got him excited as a young man about all that which is that it is beautiful when it works it's remarkable it's an incredible achievement and there you see reflected back a little bit of what the Soviets had for their scientific and industrial complex this reverence which is it turned out was was somewhat misplaced you said earlier that when thinking about the Kremlin scene it's important to think like what is the character doing other than simply imparting information what is what is he trying to do in terms of his desire is motivation so what did you bring to that final courtroom scene in that sense I think that the idea. He didn't know if he was going to do it or not because I was a sword several choices where you could go okay well he makes a decision here but I can if we push it off and push it off and said it was almost it came down to the moment when he's looking at the judge I needs to he's out there was a it was sort of in the script that they serve the pools and he's here it's right at the edge of the cliff and he pulls his right before the edge of the cliff and there's a vitamin way he's staring at him and the realization of what he's about to do hits him and then he goes over the edge and I think from an acting point of view that you know that by the time you got to this part of the story the audience wants to know what happened because again is part of crates construction and I put this thing together he stops with the explosion I need to see the immediate off your fax and then you're dating with the the off the most of it but it was constantly talking about it and then the narrative question is posed with why did it happen the how did it happen which Emily's car to starts to go off on a detective try out if you like which is a sort of political thriller aspect of the episodes 2 and 3 and then by the time you got to 5 yeah you want to know what happened why did it blow up since that's interesting I'm so you know that at that point you'll get your answering questions that the audience will have in that mind so that relieve some of the pressure off of you as a performer in some things you you not you need to juice up and all the stuff you got know that this is where I'm holding these threads at the moment and that's why the tension we had also the benefit of some circumstances that help that mystery along because if there was simply one thing that happened that night then you might run into a situation where you are faking a bunch of Storytelling to eventually reveal a fact but what's what's so bizarre about the the procedure that night is that this thing that blew up kept getting colder and colder and kept dropping in power it was so counter-intuitive in that in and of itself is a kind of gift because it allows lagasa have to tell a story knowing fully well that as he tells it it shouldn't be making sense for the people listening to it which is interesting right so now he has that going for him in a scent that he has to start to explain to them listen what I'm about to say makes no sense but trust me when I tell you this will make sense so we knowledge in those things as he went along I think helped a lot and also the fact that and I completely Groot yard that I don't think when he showed up he thought he was going to tell the truth I think he was quite sure he wasn't one of the reasons I'm so fixated on that scene is because it succeeds against you know all the traditional odds you don't have that much Exposition you don't make the exposition technical you don't make that the climax of your story on dog's back now I don't know why do you think Jared that in that mower after shcherbina stands up and says let him finish that when he chooses to finish the explanation to talk about that the graphite tips in the flaw in the reactor the stuff he wasn't supposed to talk about do you think that the gossip knew exactly what would happen to him what then does happen to a man that conversation with the KGB guy yes. I mean just whining back to slightly one of the other things that was keeping me going was the was understanding his sense of culpability which I initially found quite confusing but I but as you play out those scenes prior to that I started to understand where that feeling of culpability was coming from so that was a big part of what was happening I think that he thought he was going to be shot I'm in the image that I had in my mind was that I was going to be up against the war the back of the courthouse and shove it within within 60 seconds of this happening and yet he does it anyway and that probably just trying to understand it is what gives that supposedly dry technical seen such extraordinary powers of the state that was a paradox. I enjoyed that we you and I discussed at Craig and that was that early scene in episode 5 from you cuz it's trying to persuade him to do this. This is the right thing to do on the one hand he's dying it's the same thing that gives him the power to to make the sacrifice that he makes at the end of his life for it to be in instigating event but on the other hand if you've three years you've got left. Eternity for you and that precious so you still have a life left to live so in that moment you're you're you're dating where this idea where I'm going to die anyway but on the other hand this is all that life I have left with even if it's 60 seconds it's the most that becomes even more precious and I knew it was sort of balancing those two feelings as you are approaching that. Checkpoint if you like it right or am I going to do this or not here I thought that that when you got to that moment you I think the best thing you could have imagined what happened is that you look in the eyes of those scientists and you would see their acknowledgement that yes what you would said made an impact and they were going to carry this message 4th these reactors will be fixed you would then get shot put but that's something to be carried on and yet all you see in their eyes has yeah I know no no no no I think there is something because this is why this is something that I can that Craig and I talked about which was it was the idea of the culpability in the accountability oversight ties into the Diablo character and Auntie. Love was firmly in the cross-ties is being responsible for the whole event but that wasn't that was a bit in the script I didn't think it and it didn't make it in which is why the the prosecutor stops to dig into him about his history behind and the motivations why he did what he did and at that moment he he I felt some compassion for the outlaw of the Isle of Wendy out love even in the version of we have in in the show which is the it is a shorter version I think it was my what I get away from him and and what with the intention was was that you're on the edge of what you should do or say you're probably not going to do it and then D Olive interrupt your moment of hesitation and essentially says this is a bunch of crap and you will gossip know it and you're a liar and and that it's a it's a it's a strange thing to have a villain be the person that inspires the hero to do the right thing but that's kind of what happens there because the truth of the matter is dyatlov had no concept that what he was doing could lead to an Explorer none 0 and 2 to that extent he is innocent he's he's guilty of a lot of things but but and calling out the gossip in that moment I think is what inspires a gossip to say okay you know what actually that's that's truly knows his is true about himself although as an adult survive at 2 though I had confusion about it because then I would sit there and go will practically speaking what could he have done 10 years ago because 10 years ago when you were wearing this information you'll still in the Soviet Union it still top-down control then that they decide what the story that's going out there they decide the night if I put out there so how could you practically have done something about it out. Time all the way back then and yet he still feels responsible because that's the story I mean he couldn't have done anything I think basically he is arrived at the moment where he can this is it this is the one moment were theoretically he could do something and this man has cut to the heart of him and essentially said you are a liar that's why you're not doing anything right now when you cut and and that's ultimately what I think changes we got Subs mind come on the idea that it again you taking something out of that scene with Stalin that is go to all be worth its go to right it's going to mean something it had to be about something that's worth some bad scene also is a moment I mean you know when so I have this you know we have our different theories about how this works Jane Featherstone one of our executive producers her theory is that it's it's in the moment following that discussion with Sabrina on the little park bench there that lagasa besides I think I'm probably going to do the right thing here until the truth so everybody has a different kind of interpretation of it yeah everyone even on the day or the leading up to the day it was old swelling around and I'm sure that's versions of it where you could have because it was it was a fluid thing but there was no rehearsal so you have to treat every single take as though you're in a rehearsal you know and you don't know what's going to work and allow the additives to finally put the performance together because you end up playing you got together you really pull the scenes apart you doing this way and guys many different ways you can through their house so then you finally with the director arrived Upon A A Narrative structure and that's how you're going to do the play for the audience when they come in well you done a country that and send nobody but they don't pay for a hustle any longer back in the old days used to have three weeks of rehearsal that's gon see you I feel as though you have to treat the takes that's why you keep begging for take so that you can try and put the story together a different way each time and then let them decide when they rewrite the script for the last time in the editing room which way was it something that I think most people don't know that that that what we need the audience see from an actor is is one of many things if if they're good and if the production allows it many different choices they tried in the day and and that in that what we are saying is the one that was selected usually by the editor and director as best representing what happened that's a fascinating aspect of your craft. the most people know I wanted that I said I had two questions the first one took a long time. The second one and it and it reflects something that I talked about with Craig which is that is a writer producer what he learned not so much about his craft but about people in about the world having done this project and I wanted to ask you the same thing if you after playing this character and maybe even after watching the reaction to it if you had learned anything about people or the world or how the world works one is that I counted people who are nostalgic for that system realtor older yeah I made you feel that life was simpler back then and see what they mean do you do can you understand that perspective was everyone had the same car everyone at the same clothes every one at the same you know phone where is now now you have to worry with your cause as good as your neighbor's car and and that was cool as his dissatisfaction and wish they didn't have before yes there was there was no choice but then that was a feeling of it cuz there's some Harmony that came about from that I don't know whether I agree with him or not but I didn't experience it what else there was something else that spring to mind is just popped out of it I can let you cogitate on that as I move over to crack I feel like I would be remiss if I did not ask both of you what you thought about how much this show has become an object of political argument do you guys have any feelings about that conversation with her you've enjoyed it with you with you think it's a worthwhile thing whether it bothers you anything at all I think that a lot of people missed the point not all of them but a bunch of them anybody who looks at the show and says you know this teaches us something about blank generally they're correct the show is about people and I wish I could explain that to to those who think it's about politics it's not it's about people and it's about our our weaknesses as humans in the way we think and process the world around us and so of course it can be kind of kaleidoscopic in that regard you can look at any human failure and this is quite reminiscent of the human failure at Chernobyl Jared even thought about that if you've been like these to see it as as as it unfolded I think that that question is in the DNA of the show is in the DNA what Craig was interested in I mean that it's from the very opening line to the last line I think that went blind people so to say well of course couches or our system isn't like that system the closest analogy to me to the way that the Soviet system was set up really isn't corporate culture I'm the way that corporations are structured and out of course what's happened in the west is so much of the way that our lives are on our governments are on our influence teens and mandated by what is good for the corporations were all in it was good for the individual citizens and then I remembered the second part of that question you asked me before I did what does relate to this because the thing that I walked away with as I think some of the biggest lesson about this was the biggest danger happens when you become cynical at towards your ability to have a. I'll go to affect you a government at an inn in that in this story nobody believes any longer that they are going to be able to impact what the government does I need to take something this huge for for them to wake up and realize that they aren't in control and that the narrative is being blown wide open but no 7s the purpose of that joke isn't it about the Apple machine stuffing machine that cut an apple into three pieces they all perfectly aware of the the system that they live on that I may become cynical as to as to that role in it and their ability that and that's the biggest angel I think is if you no longer believe that you can't do anything and then you just you give up the show of course came out too extraordinary claim that seem to increase as more people find out about it that both of you have been nominated for significant Awards or once on my thanks already I'm assuming I'm not in the industry but I assume this means that more opportunities will open to both of you in your field so I'll ask both of you do you know what's next I do I do I do have things that are coming next in the I can't talk about them for say I will say that at the very least the first one is also about our world and things that happened but they they haven't much more recently and they happen much more close to home I was going to wonder whether or not people are basically throwing comedies your way or are they now that that's completely off the table until now that's rain so traumas and historical dramas it because it seems like people to tend to follow the pattern of the last thing they saw they sure do so so Ace a remarkable stream of oh God look at this depressing chapter in history has made it switched and and and listen I entertain them all I mean all that I consider all of it because what you are looking for from and I'm fascinated by history obviously what you're looking for a chapters in history where there are people in relationships embedded into it that you think are going to translate to now and offer some kind of universal perspective and Enlightenment to an audience and you know a lot of these events are just there Vents and so there they don't have quite that you know I think about like for instance Gallipoli which is one of my favorite movies and how you can take something like that and really make it about human beings that's that's what you're hoping for when you're thinking about these moments in in history but yeah I know they've they've definitely I stopped getting the silly comedy offers or you know the raunchy comedy offers and now it's it's a lot of bad stuff which is gratifying do you regret them not giving me more jokes that I don't regret anything I regret nothing about first meeting you hadn't had drinks at the Chateau Marmont and I said how many future looks a little bit of a sense of humor no other characters didn't have carrots. So just wasn't funny this is what I'm not a funny guy but he did but see you're a funny person so there were moments where you created laughs out of your awkwardness I mean I remember the first time yet so you'll I think was weak to the first day of the second week and I'm sitting with Johann in an open field watching the scene where Jared and stone have arrived at our meeting work on oven for mean to discuss you know why did IC graphite on the roof and all that end and initially Jared's character look awesome is to hang back by the helicopter was he's he's been he's been naughty enough got into an argument with your being in the helicopter and there should be no wait like right come on over and Jared just has this thing where he's walking and then he gets close the guards Arlington stop he like moves a half step in front of it and it's awkwardly steps backward and the two of us were just we honestly thought that was the funniest thing you've ever seen because it encapsulated a certain kind of look like a Sylveon nature to us this awkward scientist who never really had to deal with these things before didn't want to get something wrong like how you walk and stop but had no problem yelling at people and telling them that they weren't doing their jobs right because he just didn't have much of a filter in that regard so you mean you you made us laugh anyway so that's hats off to you and yes once when I'm going to go back to Comedy and then you'll be justly rewarded yeah but you still don't have a joke. You don't have any jokes but but you're going to stand here while they have jokes and you said yeah yeah yeah but anybody listening out there Jared Harris wants to do a comedy sending Mike Hangover 4 are we a current hard tell me about these radio. I mean you know that is not something that you should say and you know you take on me cuz I'm famous I didn't even if it is true about Edmund Kean is he's dying on his deathbed are you heard that thing I have but I want to hear you tell it so he's dying on his deathbed and then someone else him if he's is he all right and he looks after the person and he says dying is easy comedy is hard but I was wondering whether or not he probably thought that supposed to be his last words and then he survived for three more days and he couldn't see any perfect you know that button is an actor of last words I think we have arrived there at the end of this probably I think we can say final episode a bonus at his Craig's like yes absolutely broadcast I am Peter Sagal been here with Craig Mazin and of course Jared Harris this podcast was made possible by HBO sky and pineapple Street Media is co-hosted by myself Peter Sagal with Craig Mazin our team at pineapple Street Media includes executive producers Max Linsky Jenna weiss-berman and Barry Finkel this episode was produced by Christine Driscoll and Barry Finkel our associate producer is Melissa Slaughter from Craig Mazin steam we have producer Jack Glasgow and music like on Irby Craig it was an absolute pleasure to talk to you again and a genuine pleasure to see you a claim for this great work and Jared Harris absolutely a joy to talk to you and just speaking on behalf of whom shall we say a few million viewers thank you for your extraordinary work in this series as well thank you for having me
