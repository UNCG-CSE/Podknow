Mcraven was involved in planning and implementing some of the most important operations in the long and distinguished history of our military Special Forces those operations included the capture of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein the rescue of Captain Phillips from Somali pirates and the operation to capture or kill Osama Bin Laden but Bill's story is not just about high-profile successes it is also about struggling loss about truth and honor and about you melody and Second Chances it is about a deep reference for the country for public service and for them women who serve our country oven at Great personal risk and sacrifice Bill mcraven welcome to the making some time for us I'm going to start when you were a kid because you're very first operation never was Operation volcano and I was hoping you would tell us about that. 10 years old my father was an Air Force officer and we were living on Medina Air Force Base which was a little an axe to the major air force base ball like lump in San Antonio and a button-up to the base housing area was a very very large ammunition storage Depot course this is back in the 60s and as a 10 year old kid of course you need to go explore and course this was also there of James Bond in The Man from Uncle and I spy and so we are growing up I have the sense that the everything was a little bit of a couple of buddies and I decided that we're cool Mission it would be would be to scale the outer fences into the kind of break into the ammunition storage Depot just because just because it was a there was something very nefarious going on behind the fences 10 year olds can do that sometimes so we can have patrolled from the base housing are there is a large wooded area down through zelle we each had our own little weapons and also remember one of my buddies had a Red Ryder BB gun which was kind of his prized possession the other other fella had a Fess Parker and it was one of these long must get sort of looking toy weapons and then I have my Roy Rogers pearl handle cap gun six shooter we made our way to the fence line we had this elaborate plan to scale the fence is which we did black out of horse fence my buddies decided that I had discretion was the better part of valor and they kind of stayed on the other side of the fence so I made my way over the First Fence thanks for looking good I got to the second fence made my way over the second fence and then all hell broke close they are police started coming after us I scale back over the second fence back over the first fence but in the course of scaling over the First Fence I lost my Wort Rogers pearl handle pistol Spanish to make our way back through the Gully back to the base housing and things seem to calm down you know nobody's chasing us anymore and we kind of assumed that we have made it past the rough part and this is on a Saturday in the day goes by and nothing happens and Sunday and nothing happens Monday evening my father comes home from work and it calls me into the living room and he says bill I was informed that some neighborhood kids tried to break into the ammunition storage Depot and you look me in the eye and he said do you know anything about that as I mentioned in the book it's the first and last time I ever lied to my father the only time you ever lied the only time I ever lied to him and I remember saying no sir I I don't know what to think about it and he said okay, kiss me goodnight and my mom goodnight I went and took my bath and got in the bed and as I was pulling the covers up in my bed I looked on my nightstand and there was my Roy Rogers pearl handled cap gun Dad new dad know and for the next fifty some-odd years he never mentioned it once and I I say this is great parenting because I carried the burden of that live with me until my father's death maybe I still carry the burden of that light but yeah Dad new and shows nothing overtly punish me with it operation volcano reminded me of a wonderful Stephen King short story I was turned into a movie Stand By Me that evokes all of those memories thank you for telling us about it I was a great Berrington where's my cell phone that my two sisters and we're just magnificent Role Models talk about your mom and dad my mother was an East Texas school teacher, classic southern lady very gracious and very respectful of everybody but she was also or just wondering if she made sure that I got up and made my bed every morning and then and she was the one that was ensuring that I did my homework and all the sort of things that strong parents do to put their kids on the right path Air Force fighter pilot before he joined the Airforce I already was it was a hell of an athlete America and Murray State and went on to play professional football is on as a running back for the Cleveland rather Cleveland Rams right so this was back in 1930 at 38 39 time frame for Cleveland went to LA and then to St Louis and back tail light has been on the road quite a bit so he was running back and and dad was was pretty fast for a for a tailback and in fact you used to race this was in Kentucky or Murray State that used to race through horses and a 60-yard race and by race them you don't mean on their back no no I mean man against beasts right and dad would only window he's back there a little money has changed hands back then and Dad will have a little wager with some of the thoroughbred racehorse but Dad always told me looking 60 yards it takes a horse a little while to kind of get up and moving and dad was faster than 60 yards so he could beat him well the Cleveland Rams have this great publicity photo of dad as as he has joined the team and he is on the starting blocks and you see Dad coming off the starting blocks and right next to him is this jockey on a horse in the horses leaping forward and then the course the caption is you know, man against beasts are new running back Bullet Bill mcraven which what day is going well years later dad told me it was great photo of it lost that race it was a very different time you write in your book that he was paid $120 a game $10 for the Wheaties commercial for I don't remember how many games were in the seas of course I was pretty good money back then so a hundred twenty bucks a game and then is he he told me he made a little extra money on the side doing radio commercials for least ten bucks I think for a commercial my grandfather was a doctor during World War one and then later on World War II so he was just so that age of graduate from medical school in 1910 and was young enough to go over to France during World War 1 your father's father my father's father and then of course the interim. Between World War 1 and World War II he was still young enough to go back and serve during World War I was raised in a military family and I remember him telling me one time when I asked him why did you join the military and he said I remember to see how the boys watching The Troop trains come through his hometown and the soldiers getting all the troop trains heading for the trenches of Europe and that inspired him and and I think when his time to serve came that he left hand as he told me that he had four of the guys left the football team home from Cleveland all the way to the West Coast I signed up in California and then he went off to a flight training in San Antonio Texas and then fought for two years in the European theater flying fighter support for the cross-channel missions and then he went down in North Africa and Sicily in Salerno and so I had to pull in gagement World War II and then the little bit of time in Korea and then retired in 1967 bill you mentioned that your father was pretty fast but so are you for at least a year you held your high school's record in the Mile right there's a wonderful story connected to that and a lesson you draw from it about a coach of yours named Jerry turnbow I was fasting the different my dad had speed I never had great speed but I had pretty good endurance a little speed to go along with it my senior year at Roosevelt High School in San Antonio I was trying to break the school record in the mile this is 1973 - 1973 thank you I had just run my second to last race and frankly been pretty miserable. School record 4 minutes and 32 seconds .7 I believe and I just ran a 437 miles I was 5 Seconds off the school record my second last race which is a lot which is a lot of time in the mile 5 seconds is an eternity and so I had one last race to break the school record then obviously a little bit down on myself and the Night Before the Race I was at home in my father calls me and says coaches on the phone wants to talk to you while I have just left track practice so I could imagine why my coach would want to talk to me I picked up the phone and it was not one of my track coaches it was the assistant football coach and Jerri turnbow I didn't even think coach turnbow knew who I was those of us that ran track in Texas didn't have the sort of esteem that the football players got football always had the fact that this football coach was calling me. I was a little surprised I didn't even know if you really knew who I was on the phone just got this great slow. strong is this a bill is coach turbo that's what coach how are you you you said that they'll understand you're running your last race you to try to break the school record 2-mile I can't I was stunned coach even do this I said where your cervix is what type of Bill you can do this you just run hard and you can break that record and that inspiration there was this great coach that was calling me a home you're a young teenage kid and impressionable teenage good and the next day I went out and broke the school record in the mile which lasted for all of the year or is that only lasted a year and nobody cared about the record probably but but I did to her about it because what it meant to me was I was setting a goal and I was working hard to achieve that goal in the fact that I achieve that goal made me realize that I could shut other goals and I could go on to be a Navy SEAL so the point of the story in the book not everybody's going to get a chance to go on the raid to get Bin Laden or to rescue Captain Phillips or to get Saddam Hussein but everybody will have an opportunity to make a phone call to some young kid everybody will have a chance to inspire somebody to motivate somebody and you never know how that single phone call is in my case change the trajectory of my life because once I knew I could break that School record I assume there wasn't anything I could do with a lot of hard work coach turn both still alive today we've had a great relationship since I mention this after the bin Laden raid and he's doing well and his wife Jan Living San Antonio just a wonderful wonderful person but that less and that's civility kindness are never an active weakness never ever and that a simple act of kindness goes so far then you never know and I'm sure you know coach turbo back in 1973 I had no idea what that phone call meant to me and then you go 40 years later and the bin Laden raid happens in at some point in time in an interview after the bin Laden raid somebody was talking to me about my life and I took them back to this phone call the course I had not told her Stern Bill about the he knew nothing about the fact that over the course of the last 40 years my military career had influenced thousands or tens of thousands of young soldiers Sailors Marines and I have a lot of that to that phone call we're not overstating it to draw a line from the phone call to your career we are not the man again from somebody respect goes a long way when did you decide to become a seal Bill well back in the early seventies nobody knew who Navy Seals were alive today there were no movies notebooks there was one article and some magazine called men with green faces and about the Vietnam era Shields but interesting enough I didn't find out about that article my sister was dating an army green beret so this was I want to say 1970-71 somewhere around there I have been at home waiting this young Army Captain came by the house I had already seen the movie with John Wayne called The Green Berets and I was fired up by the movie The Green Berets show the young Captain comes to the door and my sister is not ready so I start talking to him and he says so I understand you're you're thinking about going into the end of the Navy I was looking to join the Navy ROTC program and I said yes sir and you said the woman y'all be a Navy SEAL cuz I work for them in Vietnam the seals were some of the best soldiers I ever worked with him here was an Army Green Beret telling me to go be a Navy SEAL. I thought this was terrific the only literature out there after he talked to me was this men with green faces so that really kind of inspired me to give a shot at me and maybe she also from 73 then I went off to college at the University of Texas and my whole time in the Navy ROTC does my gold you talk in your book a good bit about your Navy SEAL training at buds by the way your latest book see stories is just a terrific read there's something to discuss when you talk about your training that you said applied for the rest of your life this concept of one Evolution at a time they have these kind of names for the young trainees and they're called tadpole recognizing that as we go through SEAL training we are hoping to be Navy frogmen so they have four years had this you're going to go from a tadpole and you're going to evolve poipole do in the Frog you're going to evolve from a tadpole to a frog man the events that runs the swims the physical training and calisthenics they're all called evolutions of early on the same take it one Evolution at a time you saw a lot of the trainees the young students come in and start your day with 2 hours of calisthenics and they'd be thinking oh my gosh I took 2 hours calisthenics now I'm tired and we're going to have a 4-mile soft and run after that and they were going to have a 2-mile open ocean swim after that and then we're going to do more calisthenics after that or we're going to have a obstacle course and they started looking too far down the road Horizons too far or even on a daily basis so if you started your day and said oh my goodness I've got five very difficult physical Evolutions are in the day for some of the students that was very challenging you learned to take it one Evolution to do the very best you can at the event you're doing at that time the evolution you're doing it that time do the Four Mile shops and run the best you can and then worry about the next one when it comes along and that's the mental aspect of mental aspect of it as life goes on obviously you have to plan your life a little bit coarse as we all know if we're older than about twenty one year plan your life generally doesn't work but you do have to have some general Vector but my point here is your sometimes if you look too far down the road it can scare you if your event horizon is too far things seem challenging but sometimes if you just take them when Evolution a time one event of the time those events at up and the next thing you know you're at the finish line and so you graduated became a Navy SEAL and went on as you talk about in your book to live at work socialize with some of the finest people on the planet run but you write about the fact that life in the SEAL Teams always seems to revolve around fate Destiny where the hand of God why do some men live in others died why were some men saved that day and you're referring to a particular incident the. Have a different plan for us what about the crew and passengers of stray 59 that was a plain straight 59 that you almost boarded so this was in Subic Bay Philippines 1981 1981 we were conducting a train exercise International training outside so we had Australians and new zealanders and army green beret and Filipinos and some other nationalities that were with us the shield and then a hostage Rescue Training Evolution that didn't go well but yeah we kind of cleaning up we decided that we would finish the event out and is part of the training exercise the hostage who was a colonel Barney browse Marine Corps Colonel I volunteer house yeah this was all part of the scenario Soca brow she was ahead of the Marine Barracks in Subic Bay at the time wonderful Marine officer had agreed to be the hostage and I was kind of his Handler I was going to make sure that I need to get there well as the hostage rescue part of the exercise it goes south on us their size was essentially over the seals and the international Special Operations guys we had we're going to a patrol, jungle where we were to the Airfield to the Airfield and to combat Talon mc-130 airplanes we're going to land there were going to pick up the seals on airplane in the international Guys near playing along with the hostage and myself and then we were going to take off and go for about a three-hour low-level terrain-following where the c-130s go up and down the mountains about 50 feet off the deck but it had already been a long day and I'm not very successful right not a returning exercise goes well in the course of the exercise is things have not gone well I turned to the colonel and I said yeah there's really nothing left for us to do now we're going to go with these guys were going to get on the airplane going to ride around for a couple hours and come down I know it's been a long day you got a full day ahead of you tomorrow when we just got a call today and the colonel said no but let's go and see this one through ISO casein show me go for another half an hour or so and we get the air filled out of planes running late I'll buy a little bit. Turn the colonel again I said Acer one more time see if you really want to forgo is a long ride on the back of a C-130 you're going to fall asleep right now and I think I'm good we'll finally the planes land removed from our positions the seals and handed over the Hostage to the international guys the current Liberty International guy so I'm worth of the Australians in the new zealanders and so we move to the airplane and is where on the back ramp of the airplane I decided one more time to give their the Carlin opportunity to because of how much to ride around the airplane if I'm he said yeah I guess you're right let's go let's go ahead and call the day we turned around and the dashboard of the airplane you'll be headed back to our Barracks specially you got on the Jeep and went back in and I went back to my house didn't really think much of it and an hour later is that airplane straight 59 crash killing everyone on board but one person to the point of the story wasn't about me in the car at least I hope it doesn't come across that way it doesn't there were probably a lot of other people that were supposed to be on that plane that night but didn't get on that plane and then we heard later that various it again people's lives intersected with that plane and I never was but the point of the story was really you saw this a lot in your time in the SEAL Teams and I'm sure in the time in people's times in the military or all the sudden you know you went left instead of right in Iraq and had you gone right there was a an IUD waiting to blow you up somebody makes a decision that changes the course of an entire platoon or Battalion on this case just the fact that we decided not to board that plane for whatever reason you know change the lives of myself and internal browse it again probably a number of other people that were supposed to be on that plane and yes why might my point in the story also was looking into the families of that crew clearly wanted them to have you know they would they would be here today were it not for this horrific accident so it's not right to say God had a plan for me and not for them and so I can like Miley point in the chapter is you kind of wonder about these things as you go through they were great men on that plane to this day I think about it but the other thing I've said in this is because I saw what happens when you lose great Airman on a plane like that years later fast forward Neo 25 years I'm now the Commander in Iraq and Afghanistan to the seals and the Rangers and I will tell you every time we did a mission with a C-130 or an AC-130 I ask the hard questions I wanted to know whether or not we were going to be safe for the crew was going to be safe and I hope that the loss of those right Armon and Trey 59 somehow change the lives of Airman and 2001 and on prevented the lost you write that you think about them off and it strikes me Bill that we know of the successes of the men and women in the military we know of the successes of the seals but underneath all that is a and Incredibly dangerous training that what happened in Subic Bay happens more frequently don't like to imagine and that even in your own life and in your own experiences you've come close other times to die right I read about in your book something that happened in Morro Bay California in 1995 it's not just an interesting story it's an important Story That's Amore Bay by this time I am now the commanding officer of Seal Team 3 so one of the SEAL Teams on the west coast Heather Shelton 1/3 and 5 at the time Echo platoon and this was at Cobblestone was doing a pre-deployment exercise so they were getting ready to go overseas and this is one of their final exercises to his commanding officer you normally went up to watch the final training exercise as I went from San Diego off the Morro Bay California Central California that day as you're driving in Morro Bay there is this very large rock that almost looks like the Rock of Gibraltar kind of to the interests of the bay so beautiful. the inside of the harbor there it's it's calm it's peaceful and what happens is when the waves get big they get funneled into this area where the Rock is in the jetty is and the beach is on the other side and the waves that they might just when I pulled in where you hid in 15 20 25 feet which is very large for the other way if something goes I get up early to go watch The Shield frame and I noticed that there are two rigid Hull inflatable boats 33 foot boats that are part of the special boat unit that are getting ready for me to be heading out through these giant waves so I go over to talk to her younger in charge now I said hey what's going on and she will say we're going to get out through the waves we need to kind of practice list he had a plan for getting out through the waves and I said well then give me a life jacket strap me and I'll go with you show us where you going to come in three we hit the first wave probably a little faster than we should have we went straight up the side of the street probably 25 foot wave and as we came down on the other side we've been Airborne for almost 4 seconds cuz we went up the side of it you know you think of you see pictures of guys going up in jet skis and how they're in a flying above the ways what we were doing that in a 33-foot boat and you're counting and I am counting so because it's kind of natural thing when you jump out of an airplane on a static line you tend to count 1000 mm retail and your shoes supposed to open it about four thousand so you know how long your are blue I know how long I'm Airborne as the boat gets Airborne what I'm counting and it takes us 4 seconds and then we hit in between the trough of the first wave in the second way the guy on the Battle of almond a young sailor he just got tossed off we had some other entries on the boat at the Cox in the Helmsman does the right thing he swings about the boat into the next town coming wave Annie Gunn's it again to try to beat you on coming wait because you want to hit it perpendicular to hit a perpendicular shall we go up that way but probably 20 Orso knots and now we are airborne for almost 5 seconds while we come down the boat hits you can kind of hear the whole crack people get kind of thrown out a couple of guys with thrown out and now comes to wait for the day and it is probably a 40 foot wave so it is huge will it picks the 33-foot boat up and there was still another in your 6ft kind of coming over the top of the bow and it just pick us up and dumps US as a boat flips over I am trapped underneath the boat you're in a bolster seat so I had to like us a harness on so I'm trapped in the harness but not like that I've got shot line was very thin nylon line that the seals use for their weapons and for a lot of things and it is wrapped around my neck tightly around my neck and it's choking me some trapped under the boat the boat is tumbling underwater I'm strapped in the bolster seat and Shot line around my neck and I'm thinking to myself so this is how it ends and instantly know if I had been in a lot of as it just tends to happen kind of near experience is a my time in the SEAL Teams and a lot of times they happen and they're gone in a split-second you go and you move on well this one was the kind of the classic slow motion I mean I am under water the water was temperature was about 52° I don't have a dry suit on or what you doing it's cold I'm losing breath I'm starting a blackout I am trying to get out of this harness I'm trying to get out of the shot line that's beneath me and I remember saying to myself very slowly very clearly I am never going to see George and Bill John or Kelly again my wife and three kids and is I'm struggling thinking this is it miraculously I am free from The Shot line and the harness of the bolster seat and I shoot to the surface and I can't tell you how that happened which is why I use the term miraculous because when I thought through it intellectually afterwards there was just no way to untangle myself from The Shot line may I was completely Tangled Up In The Shot line and and strapped to the bolster seat to finish that you can explain why I cannot explain them but I shoot to the surface well now I'm in the next series of waves all the other guys in the boat had been tossed back towards the beach so they were safely out of the water but I'm still in the surf zone looking up in the next wave coming thinking I'm not going to make it through this way well out of the corner of my eye out here a couple of Shield screaming at me going and I turned around a couple of guys in a zodiac a very small 18 ft rubber boat with a motor on the back of it are rushing to pull me out of the surf zone and they grabbed me like an employee in the boat grabbing I hold on before the next wave comes crashing down hat is Dennis I don't know that any of us would have survived that way and those two and there were two other seals who rescued another guy that died later received the Navy Marine Corps medal lifesaving medal which is the highest level you can receive in time of Peace for Valor it's a fascinating story built but I also wanted to talk about it for another reason you write about a lieutenant named Jones who's in charge of the mission I don't know if that's a pseudonym and I assumed it was but you're right about him in the context of Second Chance run the story starts off when I was commanding officer of Seal Team 3 I had to take the number of officers what we refer to as Captain's Mast for driving under the influence and ethanol sure if you get a DUI extension of your career is over and this was a very hard thing for me to do in one of those young officers was a fella named Jeremy Carter correct also suited him I took that young officer at the start of chapter 2 times mass and found him guilty of driving under the influence charger fast forward and I talked about lieutenant John so we tend Jones was the lieutenant in charge of the crap that day while all of us probably could have had better decisions after that boat flipped over Lieutenant Jones that exactly what you would expect a young naval officer to do he pulled himself together he did what he could to rescue the rest of the crew he maintained his command presence or just did a magnificent job and so the realest or really is about Second Chances one I got a second chance in life Lieutenant Jones because the investigation determined that yeah probably made some mistakes are going to the surf zone but we're seals and we're special Warfare combatant-craft crewmen and we need to test the the kind of engines the envelope but he did the right thing after the boat flipped over in Salina Club in about a month or so ago and now I get an email from Lieutenant Jones I am single turn on Jones and 20 years and that he has read the book and he sends me this great email and says he sure had a chance to read this he says I am Lieutenant Jones recognizing it and he said that I wanted you to know I went on to have a good career another couple to Columbus in the Navy and then he was going on and without exposing he's going on to have a good life and told me that is exactly the way I remember the events of that day which was good cuz I had not had a chance to have them with you the story ahead of time but he was a great young officer probably saves a lot of lives in with his composure but Lieutenant Carter the one you took the officers Mast also got a second chance promotion board a couple years later and again very difficult for a Navy Lieutenant to make Lieutenant Commander after a DUI but haven't had the afternoon to sit on the board and realizing the value of Second Chances the board and there's a 13 officers on the board when you saw the great work looking at Carteret done with the exception of the DUI with mode him Lieutenant Commander he went on to become a Navy Commander he went on to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan and interact in particular he received the Bronze Star for Valor and so you know he saved the lives of probably greater Aki's Americans like this idea of second chances of Second Chance for me a second chance with no Jones a second chance with Lieutenant Carter think General Colin Powell describes as a young officer losing his weapon and being given a second chance by his commanding officer mistakes and I think you can kind of look at it certainly Through My Lens I realize now that there were a lot of great officers that took care of me that saw something in me that may be others didn't and said we need to give this young off for a second chance and I hope it paid off for following a loss about rigid Hull inflatable boat in Morro Bay you write the ambulances arrived and I began notify my boss is at the accident with each phone call I was reminded of why I chose the military as a way of life every senior officer upon hearing about the loss of the pricey boat had only one question are you in the men okay and that's what it's all about that says it all yes sir in October of 2001 that you are stationed at the White House in the office of combating terrorism there's a interesting story you are the man responsible for all of us removing our shoes and putting our laptops on a conveyor belt when we go to an airport well I'm quick to point out Chuck is that I'm sure president of the United States or Governor Ridge in his and his role of Secretary of Homeland Security made that decision however I may have got the ball rolling on that I was in the White House to the time and if you recall there was a fella named Richard Reid the shoe bomber sure he was on a plane and Paris to Miami and Paris Miami getting ready to light his shoe because supposedly some demolition in the shoe and he's going to light an igniter I get to work to come down in the situation room is this thing is unfolding and my boss at the time retired General Downey was up on Air Force One with President Bush so the White House has been a little bit on this because yeah we didn't know were there more richer reads out there was this again and I'll kind of conspiracy to take down a whole lot of airplanes were concerted effort on the part of of al-Qaeda and you have to assume that there are so I called the Federal Aviation Administration and got a hold of their demolition expert who just happened to be when he picks up the phone an old friend of mine named it to tell I was looking is a schematic that I had been provided of the shoe bomb I didn't think it was possible that they from what I saw that it could like button talking to what do you think you go snot I think this would work as so now we got a problem because if in fact you could put a bomb in your shoe this was difficult Nana said and I started talking I brought up the issue the laptop and I said what about a battery in laptop could initiate demolition as well of course if we thought through it I don't think we could confirm it at the time you know you said why would my screen said yeah that might happen so I called my boss rounding up in the Air Force 1 and Communications what kind of stuff I said I think we need to have people take their shoes off and on by the way we need to have their laptops checked in my defense I only thought that that would be in place for a couple months so I do have to apologize to all those people who are walking around Barefoot in the airport but interesting ly bill it was the boat anchor plot in the mid-nineties with I'm plans transiting are the Pacific from Southeast Asia to the United States that change the amount of liquid or a permitted to bring on board right we're worried about liquid explosives and now you can't bring her more than 3 oz or something that more than really answer that right and so these things all have origin there their they're just not made up out of whole cloth I'm often asked today do I still think we need to take her shoes off and have our laptops check and I always say yeah actually haven't seen the threats that are out there so I still think that this is a necessary I had the privilege of working for Bob Mueller and his staff at the FBI in two I'm 2 and 2003 and I remember we would start every single day with the threat Matrix reading about all the ways that people wanted to do us harm and so I know that it sometimes seems inconvenient but it's absolutely necessary that's a little more sophisticated and it was the threat just more sophisticated I think we are taking appropriate security measures and we realize it is an inconvenience for people traveling and I travel commercial every every week that's why I understand these inconveniences but I think most Americans would say but it is worth it to keep us safe which episode is brought to you by the forward collection from Amazon Original Stories what if what if video game characters got smart enough to

Afghanistan in charge of the Special Operations unit that I had there and we get the words at a ship the Maersk Alabama has been seized by Pirates and it's captain and for power to turn off in the Lifeboat April 2009 April 2009 show Regular by The Joint staff and we start making plans for trying to rescue Captain Phillips now hard to believe but in the technology even in 2009 was good enough so that from my headquarters in Afghanistan and the video capability the ships had their Kansas State Building the ship sad I was actually in a great position to be able to command and control the operation we had the seals left from the East Coast parachuting into the water linked up with the Navy ships on board and Captain Scott moir who was the commanding officer that seal unit really was for me the kind of Ground Force Commander if you will the commander on the ship but we had them Michelle Howard who was the Navy is a task force commander and the CEO of the Bainbridge was there I mean there were some great naval officers that were helping us in the in the operation great assets and this was the what was good for me was you could very easily call upon your helicopters and ships to do your business off though in this case off go to Smiley at work the Maersk Alabama residential by got more and Michelle Howard they were communicating on it hourly basis basically as the Hostile situation is unfolding it got to the point where I wanted the Pirates was taken off the light boat but the three other Pirates were still on there they were there representing a threat to Captain Phillips at one point in time as a Lifeboat was close to the Bainbridge and the seals took a shot at one of the Pirates came aboard the USS Bainbridge sort of abandoned his mission and his men and Captain Phillips in the Lifeboat yeah we had been in discussions with pirates and we would go over daily as the hostage incident was unfolding and we would provide them water because it's very hot out there and we were gathering intelligence at the same time and at some point in time in the discussions over bridge to bridge we convince to the Head pirate to come on board the Bainbridge and we would further these discussions so he was on on the Bainbridge for the rest of the hostage situation but wrestler course the small light bulb was running out of fuel and the pirates on board new is running out of fuel should we offered again they're Pirates so they weren't exactly the sharpest tool in the toolshed it but we offered to hook up trolling for him because later want to be drifting around so they agreed to hook up tail light rail part of our strategy was we hooked up still line and then we put that small boat in the wake of the Big Nate and being in the way to the ship of course they're going up and down and sideways and they started didn't see second they may be Pirates are spent a lot of time on the ocean but when you're in a small boat going up and down and it's a hundred and some-odd degrees out so they were getting pretty sick and they called forward and said we're getting really sick out here well why don't we bring you a little closer we're going to have to get you in your close enough so that you're not in the way but agreed to that so little by little we literally pulled them in on the winch brought the white bow down to the point where the only opportunity presented itself we had a good shot by this gave your snipers a shot but he was a remarkable thing the Lifeboat is still moving from side to side and up and down right and the only shot shots because there are three of them pirates on the Lifeboat or through portals it is a remarkable story about how the snipers were able to get the Pirates against simultaneously cuz had you just shot one of them are the chances of Captain Phillips getting shot by one of the other Pirates would have been pretty high the fact of the matter is you have got to allow the guys on the ground to make the decisions when the time comes when the opportunity presents itself and one of the things we understand is I'm the three-star Admiral of time I'm not in a position to make that call you have to have trust and confidence in your man and to do the right thing when the opportunity presents itself. What you do is Commander is you give them left and right boundaries and and that just passed for me to accept & More in this case Captain more to the lieutenant commander on the fantail of the Bainbridge to the snipers in the spider's over there and you say look if you have this opportunity you make that call and I'll be good with it and had it not gone well I will still been good with it because she know the guys going to make the best decision I can that's right so you have to take full responsibility about set boundaries and Seed control absolutely and ultimately my responsibility again had it gone wrong I was about to I mean it's not the young Lieutenant Commander in charge it's not the snipers everybody is going to do the very best I can well I give them a left and right boundaries that's what I have to do is Commander to shape the outcome of the mission I'm glad you mentioned left and right boundaries because there's another fascinating example of this also in Somalia with a I'll kind of terrorist name not on and in this case you received the boundaries from the president of the United States and you had to exceed them run you were the guy on the ground was now kind of terrorist it was responsible for the Embassy bombings and Africa East African nice to 98 Rye Canyon Tanzania and then an attack on Resort temp to shoot down an Israeli airplane in the whole lot of things bad guy in fact in the first season of this podcast Pat Fitzgerald has a storied Federal prosecutor from the southern district of New York talks and detail about the East Africa bombing so worried about chasing so since the bombing but after 9/11 we kind of got focused more mainstream al-qaida and we go off to war in Iraq and Afghanistan but all the time you know still got it Corner variety of an ion opportunity comes up and we're going to source that says they know not Han is moving from a small town on the the beach of Somalia to another small town and every Tuesday or something he would travel between these two small towns along this Beach Road now we didn't know for certain it was not fun but we had reconnaissance that could see this compound and the Sorcerer told us that he is in the blue sedan that he would go and then take this Beach Road every day we would have an indication that nopon was in the car but only an indication I went and brief depressive the National Security Council about this opportunity we would have to as a car moved from kind of point A to point B on the beach we would have a small airplane drop a bomb a very small circle bomb on the car as it was moving car moved in about 35 40 miles an hour on the Beach Road had to hit it on the Beach Road it was in between some small villages so what we didn't want to do was any sort collateral damage or injury civilians so there was a very small window about 10 minutes has ever called where it was green if you will along the road is that was our only opportunity to strike to ensure that we had no civilian casualties the day of the operation I also had a couple helicopter was going to be we're going to drop the bomb if he was still alive or if he was dead we would have going by these small little bird helicopters and the guys would shut down they would get nahan bring him back to the ship that we lost from off the Coast Old Ale emission the airplane is Airborne the helicopters launched from the Destroyers that are off the coast of Somalia we're going to time this so that the bomb drops after the bomb drops helicopters cross the beach and getting off on does the airplane is coming in to strike range they're having trouble locking on the target from the airplane to drop this small circle bomb the problem was truthful one they had trouble aligning the small circle bomb with a moving vehicle this was new technology it's time and the guidance system on the bomb had to be exactly right and as they are as a vehicle is moving along this road we're starting to get closer and closer to the end of the green part of the road your window is closed our window is closing very rapidly course we're in constant Communications with the guys in the airplane and they are convinced they can lock onto the target but now time is progressing we are the window is closing and the plan calls up says we can't do this so I have to make a decision do we Let Die Bond go assuming it is not mine and we don't know that for certain but do I let him go or do I bring the helicopters in to do a gunship helicopters had many guns on them which were not the explicit orders from the president conversations with present and what they wanted me to do was to use the bomb because there had still been there was just going to hang over for the Black Hawk Down incident in helicopters in Somalia were when sidered kind of a Redline form for the present understood that there was an option I think but one that he certainly didn't want to use because we want to be able to hit of the bond but as my window is closing I had to make a Command Decision and a Command Decision was let him get away or possibly exceed a little bit of my authority and take the helicopters into him so I made the decision to let the helicopters attack the vehicle as a helicopter coming in the guys in the vehicle opened up they had to pay 47% of the vehicle they started shooting at helicopters helicopters return fire and killed all the guys inside as helicopters landed we got the bodies didn't take us very long to figure out in fact it was but it was okay with my decision this gets back to the point you made earlier is the present was always very supportive of me his understanding of the command relationship that provide the broad guidance he is got to allow the guy on the ground or the woman on the ground to make the tough decisions that's kind of what my responsibility is as Commander just like I is a three-star had to rely on the guys on the back of the fantail Loop Bainbridge to make the right decision which is why I like those two stories together the president was Barack Obama and your direct boss was that moment right and there's a wonderful passage in your book where you speak with him shortly after the operation you write that he had a ride grin on his face and you quote him as saying I specifically recall you telling the present that you weren't going to use the little birds for direct and you agree that's what you had said and then you write gave me a fatherly look a bit of sternness in a bit of Pride you quote him okay William will let this one go he said his life and trying to cover the smile on the space Rodger sir I smiled back when was the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff he was absolutely magnificent. Only in my time as the commander of my 3 * unit he was always there always sport a special operations always supportive of me and of course she was a key figure in the bin Laden raid he was actually was a key figure in every major mission we conducted and apple Mullen as well as anybody understood that every once in a while you got to give a commander the latitude to make the hard decisions you write eloquently about the Allure of War but you also write eloquently about the cost of war and I wanted to talk to you about that second thing so many times in your life and your career you made visits to Soldiers & Sailors who are injured in the line of duty and sometimes horrific Lee sound Landstuhl Air Force Base Walter Reed hospital in Washington DC in particular about a young man named Brendan marrocco an army Sergeant a 25th Infantry Division can you talk about him and I'm only choosing him as emblematic of so many others and it was emblematic of Frankie all the soldiers Sailors Airmen Marines and civilians that I had a chance to visit when I was sick matter US Special Operations Command so I'd come off the battlefield and I'm a four-star once I would go up to Walter Reed to visit our guys that were injured in Iraq and Afghanistan I was up with Walter Reed one day and and those are my guys and I told her I wish I knew how to deal with my guys and you guys were pretty sure it's a Android they had lost legs are blast are there were severely burned or blast victims but I knew what you were there were from a lot of times I knew their commanding officer I could harass them and kind of a funny way we can have a dialogue on and it was good so I visit my guys and when I was up there in my sergeant major who was the point of contact of all the races Acer young man not a special operations guys with the 25th Infantry Division your would you mind stopping by and saying hi to him I said I said but I need direction for one and he's a quadruple amputee did Ben and Iraq as a vehicle he was in was hit by an explosively formed projectile which Play Shape charge went into the vehicle killed most guys and vehicle and left him as a quadruple amputee we go up to where the kids with prosthetics are a kind of working out in the second decan I see him leaning against the railing up there and of course because he has no legs he doesn't stand but about your three feet high so I drove over and I high kneel down and and I think he's trying to figure out who I am I get this Navy uniform on with four stars but I'm talking with him and and can't lie it's I'm not sure exactly what to say I'm in here it is a young man he's lost both his legs when I'm completely I think and parsley on the other arm cuz I'm kind of talking to him that he must have seen something in my eyes something pity or just this this this sense that this poor kid was going to have to Grapple with us at rest of his life and he turns many says Hey sir I'm 24 years old I'm going to be just fine I didn't know what to say and whenever I have bad days I think back on Brendan marrocco and I think my goodness you're here you was a quadruple amputee and he inspired me with those words and I'd like to think that my opportunity to inspire others because he inspired me and this is what every kid I met in the hospital every young man or woman that was in the first thing they always said was I want to get back to my unit and Brendan marrocco talk to me about that he said I asked him I said what can I do for you say sir my unit will be coming back to Hawaii I want to be there when they get back we got a hold of the division commander and sure enough charge Morocco was there to greet his unit when they arrive back in Hawaii he went on to have a double arm transplant to this day is out doing inspirational speaking and I will tell you he is emblematic of so many young men or women I saw but he may be a bit of a special case because rarely I had I seen anybody that injured with that much sense of self and ability to inspire the people around you wrote Bill sir quoting arauco touching me with what remained of his right arm I'm 24 years old I have my whole life in front of me I'm going to be just fine and then you're right I never forgot those words one life got a little difficult for me I remember that moment again and again I repeated those words over and over I'm going to be just fine remarkable thank you for talking about Sergeant Morocco did I take your point that he is indeed emblematic of so many of our young men and women who have served and who have I suffered horrific loss I'm afraid everybody asks you about Neptune's spear The Raid to capture or kill Osama Bin Laden in April of 2011 and so I don't want to go into great detail about that I know you've talked about it many times but I find so fascinating in that story is that in many ways was like every other mission that your teams had done in terms of the planning the training and the execution course it was much higher profile but can you talk about that a little bit every time we're doing a mission for the guys understand that that they are going to have to rehearse rehearse rehearse if it they're going to have to work out plan a plan B plan C and Plan D in the case of Neptune Spear how do we get the name by the way when we were planning a divorce because the number of folks involved in the planning was so small initially the president had put me in charge of from the Special Operation standpoint and I thinking about what are we going to call this site and as I was sitting in my office at Fort Bragg I had this little figurine in about a 10 inch small figurine that I had bought in Venice and the figurine had the god of the sea Poseidon riding on this kind of sea horse with wings and Poseidon has this long Trident spear in his hand and so I looked at it and I thought she died riding the horses emblematic of the seals on our helicopters so I thought I'll call it Poseidon's Spear and I thought well I didn't work because people of my vintage remember the Poseidon Adventure and if Mission went wrong it would be called The Poseidon Adventure so I took a little bit little literary license and I called it and Neptune Spear and I think that correctly captured not only Shields roll but because Neptune was riding on this glamorized seahorse it really was about the 160th Special Operations Aviation regiment the great night stalkers who took us in so that's how we got the name Neptune Spear how much training in planning would be required for a mission like this we were limited in the amount of time we had because as we went through the kind of planning process in the deliberation process with the present the National Security Council restarted that I think I'm late January early February and then I had six or seven meetings in the white house with a present his team and each time we were looking at the various options there was a major bombing option kind of car bombs were approached there was a little bit more of a strategic bombing option and then there was a raid option but we didn't really decide on the right option until very late at one point in time the president I had briefed plan and I developed the plan but very simplistic kind of a framework by which was really the kind of go from point A to point B to go from where we were in Afghanistan to about a bot fly directly to the Target and then we normally do on compounds where are the Seals going to surround the compounder that fast rope in legit the bad guy and then we get back on the helicopters fly out nothing overly complicated but at one point I'm the president asked me if I'd April can you do this Mission I don't know I need to bring the seals in we need to rehearse it I need to find out whether or not my plan and my expectations. In fact meet the requirements so we asked me how long did I think I would need I said I need about three weeks so I said okay you got three weeks show from early April till the end of April we pulled the seals together we had the number of training evolutions on the east coast in and out of the West Coast doing full dress rehearsals and that's a little misleading in that I've handpicked the commander of the seal unit decently handpicked the minute we're going to work for him and in doing so all of these guys had extensive combat experience so the mission itself wasn't technically very challenging to your point we knew that it had the kind of high political risk but that wasn't something I was overly worried about me I want to make sure the guys got in there I got the mission done and got home safely which is what you care about and everything of course it is absolutely and in this case putting it in the hands of the right she'll operators who know how to do the planning in the rehearsals really set us up for success of extensive planning and preparation before we took off and there's a wonderful section in your book bill it takes place about an hour before your men depart on their mission you are asked by President Obama to convey his thanks and appreciation to your men there standing around a fire pit would you read from your book place in major and I address and I said gentlemen first let me say that I talked to the present yesterday evening and he told me to pass on his thanks and appreciation for what you are about to do most of the men were deep in thought their heads cast downward but I could tell that they were beginning to understand the magnitude of what they were about to undertake I moved a little closer to the fire and scan the group of men standing before me they were rough looking serious professional focused they have the game faces on but I knew that beneath the body armor they were like any other men they had families wives and kids friends back in Virginia Beach they were good men men you would want as your friends your neighbors then you could count on things got bad real bad men who love each other as only those who have experienced combat together can they didn't know what the night would bring but I knew that they were lucky to be chosen for the mission and that was my message it was simple gentleman since 9/11 each one of you is draining to be in the man going on the mission to get Bin Laden well this was the mission and you were the mountain let's go get Bin Laden there are no Smiles no cheering and no contrived Jubilation it was time to get to work your men succeeded on that mission they got Bin Laden they came home safely many of them went out on other missions but in the end you write life is relatively simple and seems incredibly complicated but you still here to the notion that life is relatively simple and I can almost taste it back to all of her time and she'll training in Seal training we have this little rubber boat called inflatable boats small take seven men to paddle the boat and very early on in training they give you this shuttle mission about the take the boat and I go out to the surf zone paddle down a couple miles and come in and you think OK Google mission statement but you realize very quickly that unless everybody comes together unless everybody Strokes Apollo the same time and unless everybody works together unless you follow the commands you can't get through it you realize that you can't paddle the boat by yourself you need the help of the other men in the boat and by lifetree and simple what I've learned is you can't make it through life by yourself you need fresh you need college you need the Goodwill of strangers and so if you want to be successful in life make as many friends as you can have as many Collies as you can cuz you're going to need them when times get tough you know whether it's a mission to get Bin Laden or whether it's dealing with cancer or whether it's dealing with the loss of a loved one you're going to need these people and that's what makes life simpler is have as many friends as possible did you write help as many people as you can make as many friends as you can work as hard as you can and no matter what happens never never never quit I have one last thing I wanted to discuss with you and it really is the very first thing that you write in your book it's your epigraph I love beginnings and endings and You Begin the book by quoting from Isaiah 6:8 I can read it but I would much rather that you read it and then I heard the voice of the Lord saying who shall I send and who will go for me and I said here am I send me send me send me it was the first it was read every time we had a fallen soldier we would go Ramseur money and literally the ceremony on the ramp of the ceremony on the ramp of the airplane so the casket the remains of the fallen soldier would be brought on the ramp of the airplane carried by members of his unit then the rest of the folks would gather round and invariably the pastor of the priest or the rabbi would always quote Isaiah 6:8 and then I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for me and I said here am I send me and it became kind of The Unofficial motto of all of those as it went overseas send me send me to Iraq send me to Afghanistan send me to Somalia send me the North Africa send me where the nation needs me just send me I wanted to dedicate the book to all day and Soldier Sailors Airmen Marines and civilians that said send me an empress better than this war to stop this terrible Scourge that there was an extraordinary life Bill and an extraordinary service to the nation is reflected in an extraordinary book
