radio the voice of anyone on our show for your voicemail are you ready you bet I am your first quote is from the National Weather Service Alabama will not see any impact from Doria that was a tweet in response to who's incorrect weather warning haha that's right President Trump for whatever reason the president has been insisting hurricane Dorian was headed for Alabama or which it wasn't saying that he got that information for meteorologist which he didn't so on Wednesday he held up a National Weather Service map showing the path of Dorian towards Alabama but it was a Photoshop actually it wasn't even a Photoshop it was a Sharpie shop he drew on it with a sharpie he didn't even use the same color it was like a kid changing his grade from an F to a b with a crayon did you all see it anyways I'm such a bad fake he just Sharpie on this little extra Bubble at the end of it at the end of the hurricane path is exit Florida doesn't look perverted enough maybe it was supposed to be a thought bubble Mavis like if he had finished it was going to have like Alabama talking like glad you didn't know why he did that I mean the only thing I can think of is he has some sort of investment and Sharpie because we are very smart I think you're right cuz he's made a couple of gaps with the Sharpie write any changes weight on his physical from 3:30 to 2:30 Trump was so mad about this on Thursday he took to Twitter calling the hurricane sleepy Dorian I am doing a much better job destroying American cities okay in your next quote comes from England not a good start for us that was a member of Britain's Labour party reacting to who's pretty terrible week that would be prime minister Boris Johnson British prime minister Boris Johnson had a bad bad week he lost four out of four votes he lost his majority with one Member of Parliament actually getting up and leaving his party while he was speaking and his brother retired from government basically saying he wanted to spend less time with his family because his family was Boris Johnson then on Friday Donald Trump email to my map showing the hurricane Dory and was headed right as way I actually was sort of glue to C-SPAN watching some of these proceedings it's it's so we're missing about this position this week of being embarrassed by the country I live in and the country I come from a horrible place to be it's not quite a rock and a hard place it's like mud and like mow much line always embarrassed to be British anyway I just like you know it's in the blood to this they give it to you at Birth but then it's been building to the point that whenever I have a British voice unlike NPR in the mornings I just I don't even do it quickly I just loaded turn it down let you know no no no no don't talk anymore at the office all right in here is your last quote that was Bill going down the slide now that adults are allowed to participate in their very own what according to the Wall Street Journal cities like San Francisco Seattle in Greensboro North Carolina are putting on adult recess which are just as fun fun and traumatizing as they were when you were a kid a break from work you need to take a break from work and you from work from their adult lives and you can they're like hey it's recess are you are you a grown up or are you feeling do those bills have you down do you not like having to wear

world this week we heard about a way golf got even worse are panelist or going to tell you about it pick the one who's telling the truth and you will win our prize the wait waiter of your choice on your voicemail First Step it's Paula Poundstone viewers interest in golf is declining for a variety of reasons why Beach Pro-Am is finally bringing some excitement to golf the number one complaint that we get is it golf is not a sport it's a game says event Executive Vice President John Outland which really couldn't be more true up until now it's been basically a man to stick a ball and some grass navigating a midlife crisis we here at Pebble Beach are introducing defense into golf here's how it works the rules for the player hitting the ball remain the same but during his turn his opponent is free to use all means necessary to stop him from sending a ball down the Fairway one way this can be done is by what's called spotting that is following the trajectory of the ball running to where the defensive player anticipates it will drop watching it and throwing it back at your phone the defensive player can also block the offensive player which is harder because the offensive player has a club are also admissible strategies in the game of golf at Pebble Beach such as the defensive player taking out their phone and threatening to cancel their opponents dinner reservation or to enlist the Somali a to make an inappropriate wine pairing simply to call the Securities and Exchange Commission that's defense from Paula Poundstone your next story your next story of A Long Walk spoiled spoiled again comes from Amy Dickinson the only thing the game of golf has going for it is it sometimes the little white ball doesn't roll into the little hole the ball not going into the hole is what lends the game it's suspense and occasional outbursts of rage and no technology is going to ruin golf even more because Nissan the car people claim to have invented a golf ball that goes into the hole no matter what you can ship it off the green using a cricket bat and the ball will go in you can drive it off the TV using a curling iron and it will go in Nissan released a video showing a really cute 4 year old kid demonstrating this ball going in technology after getting a hole-in-one no matter where he put the ball even this free kindergartner look more bored than Tiger Woods on a dating hiatus text me Nissan ball that always goes in the hole from Amy Dickinson your last story of bad news for old men who like to swing club comes from Bim adewunmi we all know that sport need to engage younger audiences in order to stay relevant think about Serena and Venus Williams firing up a new generation of tennis players but youth is not the only way to modernize Foods sometimes the landscape itself must change for golf that means doing away with the lush green grass of the Fairway and ushering in the age of asphalt prepare yourself for citygolf CEO of international says goals
