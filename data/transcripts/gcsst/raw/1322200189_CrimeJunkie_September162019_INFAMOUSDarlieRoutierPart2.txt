high crime junkies I'm Ashley flowers and I'm Brett and we are back to tell you the second part to our story about darlie Routier and her two murdered Sons Devon and Damon so if you're just listen to this now you haven't heard part 1 you're going to be totally lost go back listen to it and come back to this episode we left off last episode with Darley being convicted of the murders and sentenced to death row police were sure darling was responsible from early on in their investigation they said the physical evidence proved she was lying she wrote incriminating note in her diary a basically confessing to it and it was a video tape of her spring Silly String on her son's grave of the jury washed 11 times before deciding no mother would act that way and convicting her but there's always two sides to a story and dorilys version all these supposedly incriminating things are much different than the prosecution presented and they lead many to wonder ifinnocent woman is currently sitting on death row when Darlene was sentenced to death in February of 1997 she couldn't believe what was happening her family couldn't believe it either it felt like one tragedy right after another right after another they lost Devon and Damen and now they stood to lose darlie to and everyone in her life was convinced of one thing she was innocent and had been wrongly accused they said to anyone who would listen that the prosecution painted a one-sided picture and there was so much more to the story that the public didn't know they went on every news Outlet every daytime talk show that they could wood and spot with the host with some of the jurors that you've been convicted darlie they tried to point out that this was a Witch Hunt and they said anyone who looked critically at the state's case would see that it was clear someone else was responsible and Darley was sitting in prison for a crime she did not commit the biggest argument the family had against darley's accusers were her injuries on her neck and a stab wound on her arm right right but didn't the police say that it was pretty superficial like that was kind of the base of the argument right said that she inflicted those wounds on her cell standing over the kitchen sink now full disclosure here I can't explain the blood over the kitchen sink I think at one point darlie applied a towel to her neck maybe she was near the sink when it happened I don't know and I don't want to get too hung up on that part because what I want to talk about where the extent of the injuries that the prosecution called you know quote self-inflicted and the number of injury that they seem to never even address so first the cut her arm was to the bone that does not seem superficial to me but to be fair it wasn't life-threatening so let's say calling it superficial was just the ones interpretation let's talk about her neck the cut on her neck came to millimeters from cutting her carotid artery which would have killed her to MMM Yeah that's not a lie if a big question last episode that the police raise like very well should have killed her and it is to be noted that the knife was stopped not because someone stop cutting but by a necklace that she was wearing and they had to actually surgically remove the necklace from her to me there is no way it was self-inflicted that she would have known to stop to millimeters away right yeah that seems incredibly unlikely in perspective for people like to sounds really small but I really had no concept for how small and it was just that I was watching this totally unrelated video on YouTube while I was like researching this case this week I like watching sometimes medical videos on YouTube and so I was watching this one on micro-needling with plasma and it's basically like a vampire facials this thing that people do to make them look younger get rid of scarring or whatever whatever but what happens in this is a bunch of like puncture your face all over and the technician just moves its wind all over the face cheeks forehead up and down up and down up and down while he's away and the doctor on this video mention that these needles go up to 2 millimeters deep into the facial tissue is so small that people are poking needles into their face for cosmetic purposes and that's how close the knife was to killing Darley okay you on this one I don't think she could have been able to cut herself that deep and known when and where to stop but I kind of have another theory just to keep playing Devil's Advocate okay what if she was trying to kill herself like I keep going back to that note in her diary where she said she was so sorry for what she was about to do whatever plan was to kill the boys and then killed herself to we need to talk more about that Diary ng because like all of this I think there's another side to it but if this was a murder suicide attempt then here's what I don't get why call police why wake up Darren none of that makes sense she didn't hit her carotid artery but she's very well could have died from blood loss I'm not buying it nothing about her neck wound looks self-inflicted to me and here's the thing we're talking about the stabbing her arm or talk about her neck wound it's more than just those two again in court that's all they talked about but no one to talk to all of her other injuries and I made a document with just some of the pictures taken of darlie in the hospital and then after she was released and I got them from the for darlie Routier. Org site which has many of the evidence photos in court documents for this case and I'm a pictures and links everything on our website if people listening want to follow along but let me send this to you and I want to go through some of the pictures of her injuries so let's look at this first picture on the document I sent you okay she's laying in her hospital bed at like Nicks and cuts and scratches all over her art it's not just like one stab when you can see the Stab Wound has been stitched up at the very top of her forearm but underneath there's all kinds of a small marks as well if you go down to the second picture that's a picture of her hand after she was released from the hospital and you'll see there's like lacerations on her fingers and what I had seen some experts say in the ABC documentary the last defense that I watched is those are consistent with defensive marks of somebody who's being attacked and trying to grab a knife if you're looking at this like she self-inflicting I mean this is very detailed to also slice your finger is in a way that makes it look like you were defending from an iPhone right is there any consistency with it being like she was stabbing and her hand slipped off the grip and cut herself on the blade while stopping the boys this is her left hand saw her non-dominant maybe yes she was right-handed or non-dominant hand to me it doesn't make sense that it was slipping when she was stabbed in the boys the wound on her arm is a stabbing her arm is on her right so maybe it slipped for her so if you want to ignore this week and okay but scroll down even further so the next picture is of her hands put out and you can see the who sang y'all the top of her hands which I cannot find an explanation for other than being in a struggle with someone possibly and if you scroll down even further deep bruising on her arm my God she has her arm held up and from her wrist to her armpit is this deep purple blue black bruise that I don't even know how you would self-inflict yeah I mean that's that's got to be consistent with someone you know really forcing you down onto a hard surface or something like I don't even think you could throw yourself hard enough to make that happen in the house again until she started calling his name little boys are just laying a living room asleep to that point to I guess you could you could look at that two ways you can say how it is no one waking up when she's struggling with somebody this severely but if you keep scrolling like she's got is bruising on both arms and the Knicks and the cuts and the scratches are just all over and super consistent and experts have said that like if we go back to her wounds that would establish that hip bone they said that that's super consistent with self-defense in her right arm with her dominant arm if someone is coming down at her with it up in front of her with a knife that's exactly what she would do so I I don't know personally how anyone can look at these images and see self-inflicted it's they seem like someone got a struggle and if it was self-inflicted it would seem like it would be super time-consuming super elaborate it just doesn't make sense okay so if there was an attacker can we go back to darley's diary entry you said it's not what we thought right right I guess what else could it mean when she said I'm so sorry for what I'm about to do the prosecution the police they take out the incriminating thing and that's kind of what gets publicized over and over and over but that was just one line from an entire entry and it the whole entry if you were to read like the whole paragraph says Devin Damon and Drake I hope that one day you'll forgive me for what I'm about to do my life has been such a hard fight for a long time and I just cannot find the strength to keep fighting anymore I love you three more than anything else in this world please do not hate me or thinking anyway that this is your fault know this was not an apology for what she wasn't planning to do to them it was an apology for what she was thinking of doing to herself darlie was thinking about taking her own life she had I mentioned briefly in our last episode that she had been suffering from postpartum depression after having their third son Drake and she wrote a lot about her feelings in her diary and the writing was just one month before the Murder She said she didn't go through with it she wanted to be around her boys you wanted to see them grow up and nothing in her diary made it seem like she was a threat to them she was depressed sometimes and I don't think people really talk about how common postpartum depression is even now that I've seen so many of my mom friends feel so alone until they start talking to one another and realize that it is so so common but it's not talked about as much now in 2019 like how are things in 1996 right let me tell you one of the times that I was most outraged and all of my research so I was watching an interview on ABC and the prosecutor who was lead and darley's case was talking and he was trying to make a point that Darley was the exception to all the rules that you can't look at her if you were a normal lens he said listen I get this whole case is it normal parents don't normally talk about killing their kids but mothers don't normally commit suicide either his point being that she was talking about suicide so because of that she clearly is the one who killed her kids and I was appalled mothers are not superheroes they're not immune to human emotions and a mother who's suffering from something very natural and normal should not be put on trial for murdering her kit like I just couldn't believe he was saying that out loud and that he really meant it is absolutely outrageous like at my job is on the ground right now but I am seething with anger again I like I couldn't believe he wanted to be on tape saying something like that I'm sure but you're being interviewed and broadcast the world great perfect time to be especially terrible at being a human and the problem is like I I think you really believe that and I think it's something that he could get everyone else to believe at the time because of another case that happened just a couple years before the Routier boys were murdered if you've been listening to me do ads for any length of time you know I hate shopping in stores and I do almost all of my shopping online exclusively and one of the main reasons I love online shopping is because you can almost always find discount codes somewhere on the internet if you look long and hard enough and I used to search high and low for them I was all about saving that money then a year or so ago I was introduced to something amazing called honey

tries a bunch of different promo codes and then it applies the one that gives you the most savings it's nuts and it doesn't all in just a couple of seconds I can't believe they even have to advertise

back to her show one of the main reasons the police the prosecution and the public found it so easy to believe darlie would kill her own boys was because of a woman named Susan Smith and this isn't just an assumption according to ABC and CNN in the early stages of the investigation people were saying darlie was there Susan Smith so who's Susan Smith Susan Smith was a South Carolina woman who just two years before all of this was in the national news she had made claims the police that a black man had hijacked her car with both of her kids inside and now the kids in the car were missing and she did all sorts of press and played up being The Grieving mother begging for them to return the kids to her and police never really bought her story and after 9 days of this charade in the public she ended up confessing to killing both of her kids by Rolling her car into the lake with the two of them trapped inside oh my God the public was outraged and outrage is even an understatement for where she live in South Carolina especially because the entire public felt like they've been had like thousands of people were searching volunteering and all along they were helping a woman who murdered her own babies so just two years later when darlie has a crazy story about an intruder coming into her home for the sole intention of killing two innocent kids and maybe her people start talking right away she was Texas's Susan Smith right from the very beginning we everyone knew about Susan Smith everyone hated her so maybe if dorilys Case would have happened in another time or Susan Smith never committed her crimes at all maybe people would have been more likely to believe that there really was an intruder and on top of the fact that people hated Susan and that kind of translated over to darlie the prosecution made a huge deal about how darlie bleach her hair and got breast implants and they use that as proof of what I don't know but it came up over and over and over in my research and even in the last event segment they interviewed a juror who said like who goes out and spend $2,000 on breast implants and I didn't like her because her clothes and jewelry were flashing it's never like the kind of stuff I would buy so she's pretty but you don't have breast implants in your hair isn't bleach like what does that have to do with any of this like this case with a full-on character assassination and the jury focused on the boobs and the hair and not the fact that all the parents in the neighborhood so that darling was a great mom and they would let their kids play at her house all the time and she loved her kids like all of that was gone so the jury is already thinking all of this stuff so when they see the Silly String video it's like every validation they need to hate her but let me tell you what they didn't see the police put surveillance on the grave site which is not super legal it's a very weird gray area and no one's ever been convicted of doing anything wrong with the police all plead the fifth there was a big trial cuz there's no maybe this like expectation of privacy by a gravesite whatever but they had basically Mike to the grave site and we're taking video and what they had that the new stations were therefore was that before the Silly String party there was a two hour prayer vigil that was taped the public never saw crying and praying talk about missing the boys and all of this feels super raw super real and super normal and none of that was ever played for the jury all that they saw was the Silly String so I fully get that there's a ton of factors surrounding this case that played into people's perception of darlie right a wrong which by the way most of them are wrong but like it's not like they're just convicting her on her looks the partial negative actions or other people's bad actions but there was the night that she said she had moved but there was no evidence of the glass over the bloody footprint the knife inside the house that was used to cut the screen and the whole fact that the window and area around it where this guy is supposedly came in and out with completely undisturbed like there is some physical evidence that is not adding up to her story no matter how much she was a victim of this undo media scrutiny there was so let me give you what I've learned about that because darling has put through multiple appeals and new information has come to light about a lot of that stuff so let's start with the knife and I'll be honest right off the top I can't explain why there was nobody in front of the knife on the floor where she said she picked up in the utility room if we're going to look at this evidence like with the Assumption of Innocence my best explanation which I do believe it's possible is that the human memory can almost be worthless especially in times of trauma a very well could be that that part of her story she really does believe to be true but she's maybe just misremembering like her brain is filling in a gap exactly what I know for sure though is that her talking about the knife on the 911 call to the operator isn't as Sinister as the prosecution made out to be or even the statement in Dallas blog beat it out to be that we talked about last episode they presented it like she's offering up this unsolicited information to the operator and trying to like skiing to cover her tracks but let me play the entire part about the knife for you right now so you'll notice on the call that she doesn't just come out and make up excuses she's just responding to a operator right and it's not even like she does it right away is a full minute on the phone before she realizes the ramifications of what she had done instinctually to me that didn't sound like a woman setting the stage it sounded like a scared mom who has no idea who did this or why and she's afraid the only piece of evidence that she might have is gone okay so I'm willing to throw out the 911 call and even like the whole unexplained ability of the knife but what about the glass over the bloody Footprints will darley's defense team points out that the scene was contaminated by First Responders when they were originally called they were there to perform lifezette measure so there was no caution for seeing preservation people were in and out and they say it's very possible that one of the people on the scene maybe like move glass around with their feet or things got shuffled around okay I guess I know what type of CSI moment everyone is hoping for but like real cases in real life are so messy but I might have some hard science to throw at you to convince you someone could very well have come in and out of that window so first let's talk about the prosecution's claim that there wasn't any evidence someone had been in or out of that window because there was dust that was undisturbed and no footprints in the mall took that was their big claim Wilfred but I saw a picture of the window sill in the documentary I watched at all like I could barely see this quote layer of dust that they said was undisturbed and the mulch under the window isn't under the freaking window at all like you could right on the concrete first and the mulch is like a couple of feet away so Darlene's husband are and even demonstrated for a news Outlet how someone could easily step in and out of the window and it's hard to explain because when I first hearing about this and reading about this I imagine something kind of high up that you have to like grab onto then like straddle your legs threw me to the ground and very big so went there and did his demonstration he literally put one leg through the screen Crouch down like duct under swung his body through then brought the other like through and you can slide in and out without disturbing anything so to me the dust and the mole snapping disturb is meaningless so let's go to the fibers on the knife because for me this was what was the game changer like originally I thought listen forget everything else if the knife that cut the screen came from inside the house why are we even talking about this case is open-and-shut but here's the real scoop and I've heard two different possibilities from both ABC and CNN so the first possibility is cross-contamination when we talked about fibers being found on a night we're talkin about itty bitty microscopic little things that weigh almost nothing and therefore transfer very easily so this guy does expert need Charles Lynch told ABC that when he got the Butcher Block to test the fibers they had already been dusted for prints which means if the window had been tested then the Butcher Block B could have been transferred there the other Siri came from CNN death row documentary and Darlene's new attorney said that he got seven random fingerprint brushes tested and four of them had the same chemical consistency and appearance as the fibers on the bread night so it might just be something in the brushes and totally not related to screens or any of this at all install those fibers weren't tested against anything else initially it's like they test them to see if they could be consistent with the screen and then they got the answer that they wanted they were like okay boys were done with lock this lady at the well we can't exclude all of the evidence I think if we look at it critically which I hope anyone would do in a death penalty case I at the very least have Reasonable Doubt and that's before I tell you about the piece of evidence that I didn't even bring up in the first episode because if you're on the fence now just wait so in the home amongst all the blood and the chaos and cut screen and then knives there was also a couple of prints that couldn't be identified they didn't match Darley they didn't match Darren they looked like an adult's so they're thinking it's not the kid but here's the crazy part being never compare them to the kids of Prince because at the time of the murders and the first trial the medical examiner never even took print samples from the two boys you're kidding isn't that some sort of protocol it was but they just never did it and years later when darlie tried to appeal her conviction they got an order to exhume both boys conclusively say those prints did not belong to them either but when the boys were buried they were actually buried together holding hands and so many years later her water had leads the casket and by the time they got them out there was like nothing usable that could be obtained so now darley's team is forced to try and identify the print using DNA and this print is infamously known as a T5 Jayla. The evidence number so you'll see it like pop up everywhere if you're a researching this case because people have been talking about it for years and DNA has been requested over and over and over and it was finally granted to test this 85j fingerprint but we're still waiting on the results so is that all we have in the house to test against a possible Intruder like just this one single fingerprint yeah the evidence in the house is sparse and that's what makes so many people believe that someone within the house had your perpetrated the crime but there was a big piece of evidence found outside of the house and not like right outside we're talkin 75 yards away that totally kind of shakes this case up so in an alley next to a trash can and like right above a drainage opening with a single stock with blood on it it was collected when police initially Candice the neighborhood and when they had it tested it had both boys blood on it okay what does it mean to me it means that everything Darley has been saying is real but someone else was in the house and that someone else ran out of the house but how do we know for sure that it belongs to someone else like could have been planted right are you saying like planted by Charlie yeah I mean again looking at this from the prosecution's perspective if she did it and we have this piece of evidence 75 yards away something I know is connected to the scene because both victims blood is on it is it possible she put it there to help support for Intruder Theory what a lot of the non Darley supporters say that she was the one who put it there but the y in the how don't really make sense to me like if she's planting something why there is far enough away that it could have easily been missed somebody could have picked it up and threw it in the trash it could have like gone down that Steward like it got knocked off to end of the street cuz like gone down the drainage ditch like this is your only chance to get police to believe that someone else was in your house or would you put it a little closer to the house maybe in the middle of the street I don't know to me is a little like inconspicuous and if this was a planned I think she would have had just for the timing purposes so when the paramedics arrived remember Damon was still alive and according to experts his injuries would have only given him about 8 to 9 minutes to live and we know that darlie was on the phone with 901 for almost a full six minutes of how long the call is I hate like 5 minutes and 44 seconds or something like that so if she planted this then she would have had to have Dad both ways then in just 3 minutes she would have had to have like taking the song put it in each of their blood ran 75 yards away drop us off 175 years back and watch her own wounds which member is it just to cut we we have bruises have next then she gets on the phone with 911 like I don't understand how that would be physically possible to the physical elements of it are explain it away immediately to me there's a second person I don't know who that second person is I don't know how the second person fits in I mean you can go down a rabbit hole and say it is a second person at the house you can say it's a complete stranger and Intruder but I think if ever it like if you're looking at the defense side of this they're saying that likes someone else was in there and what they wonder is it going because this is right by this a drainage ditch they're wondering if maybe they like it down there so we know very little about this stock but it's one of the item that darley's appeal attorney is having retested and where was first researching this case and hearing about this song over and over I imagined that it was from an intruder like was actually thought that maybe they would have worn but I've heard some Rumblings online that some people want the sock tested for Chloroform what to the strange part of this case that hasn't been reported by a ton of really big Outlets but I see stated as fact and like forums and YouTube videos including like the the victim's extended family had talked about that so there's this theory that sexual assault was part of the motive of this crime that may be Darley was knocked unconscious with something like chloroform so that's what this like socks and comes in maybe the person like I core from on a stock and that's why the stock was out that's why I had blood on it whatever she was knocked out before her boys were attacked and that's why she didn't even wake up even though she was a light sleeper and I'm seeing in the same places that her underwear was missing and she thought them and took it okay I feel like this is kind of coming from Left Field that's exactly how I felt when I was researching this case because of it I'm like why are we not all talking about this like why was she tested for drugs was anything else tested for drugs how many question but at least makes a little more than just a stranger coming into just murder maybe someone just saw her sleeping on the couch like if I remember correctly from the crime scene like they did lucky staging there was an actual photos but I think the boys were sleeping on the floor so maybe the person who came in didn't see that the boys and this is the weird thing that if it's true I just don't get like where is the underwear and does this explain why she slept through her son's being stabbed and her own throat being cut like how do you not wake up from that I mean yeah and if her underwear I'm missing like he could still have them or maybe they're down the drain where the sock was opened up like a lot more questions if you're buying that someone other than Darley could put that stock there who knows what evidence was disposed of I mean I guess I was playing I'm definitely buying into the fact that someone else was there you know it doesn't make sense for darlie to have put the socks the sock being there doesn't even make sense but it still doesn't make sense to me for just a stranger to come in off the street to do this so I disagree a little bit like I feel like we've covered a number of cases where someone completely unrelated to a victim perpetrator violence for no reason other than to perpetuate violence and oftentimes there's no connection no motive like obviously there's Israel Keyes but I also when I think about this case I think about the Tommy Lynn sells episode that we did in the fan club oh my God yeah that's so close to space house kills a kid he never knew and this kid's mom was put in jail for it so this stuff does happen it is terrifying to think about it but it does happen and we're about personal safety and being prepared are show no it does happen but I'm not sure there weren't more contributing factors in this case because there is still one more bombshell I haven't told you that may hold the key to answering all of our questions this episode of crime

today all right now back to our show years after Darley with convicted of murder and sentenced to death and ask David came out at the Hest of darley's appeal attorney it was an affidavit signed by darley's husband Darin and it said a couple of interesting new things the first was that apparently darling had brought up separation to him the night of June 5th no previously both darlie and Darin told investigators that they like Kiss Goodnight please ring about me everything's hunky-dory so this is new but this is not what is that Darren admitted to committing Insurance scams so previously he had had someone steal a car so that he could collect insurance money and apparently he had been talking to a couple of people about setting up an insurance scam on his home he wanted someone to break in steel a bunch of stuff then he would collect the insurance money pick up the stuff late and basically share the profits with whoever committed this crime I'm sorry what yes but before will apparently when darling was first arrested the lawyer is that she was assigned we're talking about bringing Darren up as an alternate suspect like Darley had a $250,000 life insurance policy on her he was looking kind of shady because all this insurance stuff but Darren had found another lawyer who told him was if you hire me I won't bring you into any of this and wouldn't you know it. I got hired right after that kind of seems like a conflict of interest interest and Darley didn't find out about Darren's insurance scam plan until many years after she's already been on death row people and an even Darren says no darlie had no idea about this she said that she had no idea he was plotting this damn to like have somebody break into their home so what did she say when she found out she said he felt betrayed I don't know if it made her think that he could be involved or responsible like the to stay married for a long time and when they finally did divorce Darren kind of give a statement he said you know we didn't divorce because I changed my mind about her innocence or I don't love her I'll always love her she's the mother of my children but I just need to move on with my life okay I'm sorry I'd like to not shake what you just told me has anyone looked into this anymore like was or someone he tried to hire who else even knew about this will in the number of people knew about it even though these except that I think but when he was asking about it he was like I don't know why I never liked thought to mention this before or two and two together and said that robbery gone bad what if this was more than a robbery For Hire like Darren swears up and down that he never even got to the point of hiring someone specific and he's like if I had I would have names of police like I would want to give them somewhere to start but I don't know maybe he's defending darlie so fiercely out of guilt for something he did or maybe he did nothing and you just being a good husband again like in Charlie's case you can look at Darren's actions through whatever lens you want to all we can do is wait for something scientifically solid to come back to hopefully give us answers in this case darlie has appealed her case a couple of times the first time was on the basis of the transcripts like her original court reporter made something like 1800 significant errors in the transcript and spelling mistakes or grammar but she would record people's answers wrong she would change statement like very crazy stuff and normally be something that would get a person a new trial but the reports were fixed and darley's appeal was denied she did not get a new trial based on this so since 2008 her team has been focused on just like new physical evidence and trying to get this stuff tested they want the fingerprint they want the stock there might be some other evidence I don't know about the last report I could find some 2018 and it just as were still waiting for results while Darley sit on death row now there are whole websites devoted her innocence other groups devoted to making sure she stays in prison this is one of those cases that gets more and more convoluted the deeper you dig and all we can do is hope for justice for Devon and Damon whatever that means in 2007. He wrote a letter to those who support hurricane be found on the for darlie Routier website and I'll read it to you now from December 9th 2007 it doesn't seem possible that it's been 11 and 1/2 years since the nightmare began I close my eyes and it seems just like yesterday the boys were racing outside to play with their friends so innocent so alive so very precious my mind plays back like an old home movie first steps and birthday parties I have so many memories each more precious than the first at times they are my salvation and other times my undoing yet even when the pain is greatest I force myself to feel it it reminds me of what this is all about my pain is intimate and deep a pain I'm not sure I can even comprehend had it not been forced upon me there have been times I've simply wanted to say no more to just give up it has been during these times that I felt each of you holding me up I realize more and more each day that I'm not fighting this battle alone with each tiny step you are all holding me up through all the times of Despair and frustration one of you has always been there to catch me when I fall the Injustice of this system has pierced my soul get each of you help me heal your belief and support helps breathe life back into me when I feel like there's nothing left there's a song by Celine Dion and titled I'm everything I am Because You Loved Me I sang the song for my precious baby boys now I want each of you to listen to the words of the song this is what your love and support has done for me to Simply say thank you is not enough and there really are no words to express the depth of my gratitude I feel for each of you I know that my boys are looking down from heaven with the same love and attitude for each of you through this fight they will never be forgotten I hope you believe in angels like I do and realize each of you have two of the most precious angels watching over you as well with love and prayers darlie Routier if you want to dive deep into this Rabbit Hole go check out our sources for this episode on the website crime junkie podcast.com and let us know what you think when you come out the other end because honestly I've had a couple of weeks of the case now and I still don't know which way is up and be sure to follow us on Instagram at crime junkie podcast will be back next week with a brand new episode crime junkie is an audio check production so what do you think Chuck do you approve
