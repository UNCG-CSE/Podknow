
there's no place to escape to this is the last time
 Sumptuous Sumptuous Parisian Birmingham UK looking at the highway he could smell the fumes you can smell the fish and chips residue was that man puddles in the street where in working class in England Birmingham from this is where they understand this is where they got their dark sound they were super dark and it's not allowed where they get their all their benefits taken care of and they live in a pristine pristine Society in the I figure out a way to rebell against it by becoming evil they actually did do I could see heat now why Ozzy Osbourne was so somber we're staring at a highway and those cars keep on going by Tsum Tsum tsums isn't that exciting you know what to do with also just straight-up like you look at the in-room dining in the UK and she's got a different flavor it's the way you
 chicken liver parfait that was it was Prime Cut full face rump is how they call the meat here. A strong and has it been staring at Henry we are on the road mildly exhausted but of course it's always wonderful to speak with you want to thank everyone who came out to our showing Manchester it was unbelievable is what I would call it Henry unbelievable we spend our entire day spitting loogies into a bucket cuz kiss one I got some mysterious drinkers disease spine Marcus is fine so I'm wondering if it's all the sugary snacks all the sugary drinks perhaps that's creating a coating of cancer on his endocrine system
 chocolate basically all of them all of the weird oils in the in the Fate that the weird bits and all his onion flavored will snacks he's eating all day and then he tried to describe to me his his his way of eating them is like don't worry Henry I don't eat them all at once I eat them little bits at a time and I let him just stay open in my bag I looked into his bag his like carry-on bag it's just filled with half-open Shale fucking crusted over bags of pickle and onion I think it will called like one chickens I think they're called munchkin kittens and they're absolutely I was going to say but of course we do have a lot of news stories from the UK speaking of chips there was two news stories this week and there was zero zero
 they are letting it pass they have forgotten but they did cover something very interesting there was a man who opened up his Heinz beans and there you know what there was in there nothing but the sauce except for one bean and then they put him on the cover and then today that was his name what was his 911 and then today a man opened up a bag of crisps which is what they call chips over here Kissel are you being really Continental right now and he opened little fluffer in there he was so horny little puffer the look on his face because it showed him with the one crisp right in that bag empty and him this triumphant look of like gotcha. She has been waiting for this to fucking come down the pipe for him this is a European this is a UK epidemic apparently there's someone
 in the bag of crisps and putting one being in the canister of being beans and here they eat a lot of fucking bands they love the beans and I mean honestly I mean I don't mind means it just like sometimes I don't need the beans we are both of the mind if you don't nothing we don't always agree better things obviously we different punishments only comes to food but both of us are like beans me the man situational and a barbecue restaurant then I barely get him absolutely the only three spoonfuls of it cuz I'm so full of beans to me absolutely here and Margaret Supple breast from the who's Tommy did you ever see the movie who's Tommy you missed that boat
 who plays pinball you know that that's what that song is based off of pinball wizard yes alright me who's Tommy is a very famous rock music rock opera as it were done by The Who that's why it's called the who's Tommy technically it's called Tommy but it's written and produced by the who I thought it was who's Tommy know it's like how fast and the furious presented Hobbs and Shaw write the who presented Tommy Tommy by Tommy was fake he's not realize our Hobbs and Shaw isn't that set as is the movie Rudy about the life of a real person but indeed it is not nearly as romantic or as triumphant as they make it seem in that movie because they wasted a bunch of people's football careers letting a mentally handicapped man blowing play just as so everybody could applaud when they released him back to his home but what you don't understand is in the movie they're like oh my God They Carried him off the field and it was so unbelievable that's a waste of time
 joke they were laughing at him and that's when they carried him off as a lark put it in the film near the Disney find it anyway but you usually have some stories to get to today I suppose because we are talking about food that mean when we're on the road together we do talk about food ostensibly because we're here and it's kind of funny to see the true differences between the two contests and we will have obviously we have a lot of blisters in the UK that's why we're traveling all over the new Katy to imagine there being funeral vigorously assaulted at this point they're used to being roasted by American I'm the last episode that we did mention this was the last relaxed fit episode are we did mention bear meat and I have to say out of all the 9/11 JonBenet Ramsey Mormonism organism I have never received as many hundreds not even exaggeration how do you say close to 500 between DMS
 oceans on Twitter mentions on Instagram straight up emails so we can't read them all but I think the overall consensus is you can eat it you can eat it and people doing it but it's greasy it's crazy I mean so much to us information you guys that think you know what made me think that's what I made me do yeah I know you a little burp in their beer sausage yes it is commonly served in a sausage because of the texture and nature of the beer sausage blueberry bear or a Blackberry bear which is bears that was supposed to be taken seriously do taste like they do taste like what they just because they eat the berries to blackberries becomes sweetener fat becomes blue
 why people say that although I eat it on a stick it in the steak I really got to be like all my cousin makes it in the barbecue the same thing it's mediocre all right there it is so thank you so much for waiting on that we do have some stories lpotl at gmail.com emails about anything other than we got it we actually this story was a little bit older this is Ashley from last week but we just didn't get to it and Henry and I wanted to cover today we're going to go to Alabama and this story is crazy dude so this is from BBC News Alabama shootings boy 14 years old in mit's killing five family members so this dude is a is accused of killing three of us siblings
 I'm age 6 months 5 and 6 and his father and his stepmother he's being charged as a juvenile right now but like bump those charges up and make an adult although again 14 years old man what the hell is this about this guy I mean I will get into some detail as to as to why he did it he's snapped because he didn't realize that his mother was his stepmother apparently they did not tell him that his mother was a stepmother he tried to cover.
 for not to because they're like maybe if we do go kill us I mean I think style in the middle of the night he shot them one by one by one including I believe it was a five-month-old a six-year-old I believe I don't it was 5 and 6 months old and 5 year old and a six-year-old and then his mother and father step mother and father and the father was only 38 and then Mom was thirty-five so this is a young new family is a young family he a mask for the whole family and I guess they took just recently told him that his mom wasn't really his mama was a stepmom I am not remotely blaming the parents whatsoever vocals normal information until there around 12 know when to tell the child I think you tell a child as soon as they are able to understand but maybe 14 is when the kid was going to be able to understand maybe this kid was like
 think she can handle it I'm in that obviously we're going to wait to see what else comes out about this kid we have a really haven't seen any really other information about the nature of this kids emotions I don't know if they were going to talk a lot about that because he was so young but I think that you tell a kid as early as humanly fucking possible I think that you tell the kid 4 years old 5 years old explain that there are different families and I can understand your people just thrown in your house but it was explained to you so you are you experienced desk so you are viewing this as like well I didn't tell everybody I certainly did not kill everybody I was 12 years old and then I learned very quickly that sometimes fathers have sex with their children and it's disgusting
 playing with Batman and today I'm learning about some disgusting things of adults to children when asked didn't ask your opinion you just had Foster Brothers and Sisters I think it's beautiful with your parents did but it would be nice now we're already would have been nice so I'm not saying this is remotely weren't in any way shape or form but whatever but we're seeing here that is this is very similar to the defeo family Amityville I mean not remotely but the fact that one dude killed it and all the rest of the family that since absolutely. I don't think he was involved in a 12th guy who knows when he got a hold of her how we learn the idea of well just kill Every Blessed thing because you mentioned how it literally was like a Gestapo tactics
 we're just put a bullet behind the head so she must have seen something where he's like that's how you do it Wolfenstein you're going to blame Wolfenstein Wolfenstein Wolfenstein II the great game all three of the new games are incredible it is very very scary did this kid automatically jump to killing everybody instead of back in my day you could do anything you could hitchhike it was safer than hell you just have their other weird adolescent ways to say I think what you said is correct I think is going to find out this kid obviously had to either history of problems yet or he had some kind of emotional imbalance obviously but it's not even like the adoption thing I understand is my I think a lot of siblings do that thing where they're like you know you were adopted and it was I mean obviously in my case my brothers tried to pull that off and my mom and I look exactly alike and I'm also super tall like my dad
 and I was like you know what I think it's probably I probably can't understand like the adoption thing would be a little bit more like damn my entire life has been a lie who are my parents but this is just a step mom this is such a low-level thing that you don't think it's not that challenging to explain to children by PornHub stepmom is on their children are doing just fine I think it's much different if you were like that the Dead fritzl Guy liked riding. Joseph Mercy so your mother was also my daughter and I knew she had loosened or I could wake up a child verse my shipments inside of the vagina that's a hard conversation that's a disgusting conversation Josef fritzl
 believe he's dead now it's filled with Candor though he might be dyed back check her quick message back from the fact Checker here he is still alive he is one of the worst to people that we've ever talked about. He is still alive he is 84 years old and 4 years young he is old and he is living in a prison he's incarcerated at garston Abby and evidently he still has a wife Rosemarie fritzl anyway so was it news like two years ago that was my daughter's my wives my bank's my love's like it was something like that I'm not sure I hope not
 I hope what I said is not true I'm sure that it is with the story where more information is going to come out about this 14 year old kid yes we're going to find out exactly what's going on with him or not because he's a minor but now this is the question in and this is always the question Up For Debate 14 years old he is a child and he's a child do you charge this person as an adult I believe that we have a rule and I don't know why they've been able to do this for so long same thing that happened in Wisconsin with the with the Slender Man stabbings an adult at this age this is when you can give consent this is when you can legally have intercourse then I do not believe we should be charging minors as adults he probably needs to be in a home he needs to be in a hospital yeah for a long long time I mean what aisle is not going to help this kid is going to make a fourteen-year-old a sociopath even more so and he's just going to become hardened and he's going to become like Michael Myers
 severity of the crime in the way that they planned it he lied to the police he tried to tell them that somebody came in and broke in the house I'm so they they didn't realize like that was total fucking bullshit so he immediately confessed the Slender Man stabbings those two little girls I mean the one love main little girl technically plan the whole fucking thing which is all this like difficult weird gray area / prison does not rehab these kids and they are so young that you'd like to think that there was places for them to go but we were just I believe it's called Adam son the documentary from HBO it's either that or mother of a it's it's about a sociopathic child yes yes I was 20 years ago where the problem though is that with the mental health issues and we have in America we don't have the beds we don't have the infrastructure and a lot of times case
 the dolls that are the wealthy people can put their kids in there and send them away but if you need to go to a state-run hospital good freaking luck because those have basically just become what prison is we don't have good mental health care in this country works the most of it before you do the crime that she would present well that is an interesting conversation so it's beer me that's not the question this week the question is should a 14 year old regardless of how heinous the crime is be charged as an adult so against lpotl at gmail.com you know we don't know we know it's thank you again for the information thank you feel like Forrest Gump underwater Observatory disappears without a trace baffling scientist is crazy news articles written by George dvorski hell yeah
 important scientific data in the Baltic Sea has mysteriously vanished the underwater Observatory which you'd been on the seafloor since December 2016 the sea floor so it's attached the fucking bottom of the oceans on the bottom of the ocean he's managed by the geomar helmholtz Centre for ocean research and the helmholtz Centre you stopped on August 21st at 8:15 p.m. local time Transmissions from the three hundred thousand Euro $330,000 station came to a sudden halt divers were dispatched the site only defined much to their astonishment that the entire structure was gone save for a shredded transmission cable according to a gmr statement so do we know where SpongeBob and his friends were and the day of that baby. I want a trial trial I want to see SpongeBob SpongeBob
 Maya personalized tour of of Edinborough needs to do the thing in the center of town when used to put a guy up on a fucking cross right maybe you should tie up his arms okay to cross and put this kind of headpiece hold his head back in the gut him pull out his fucking intestines right and wrap around his torso a bunch and then burn them and make them eat him and shit cuz that's called being drawn and quartered after that okay that's the being drawn that's what should be done to SpongeBob another question Up For Debate but also Up For Debate is how the hell did these people get down there to the ocean floor and how did they do it undetected hears and why would they do it back to the article The Observatory was any restricted area off the northern coast of German e-boats including fishing vessels are not allowed into the area that somebody or a group of individuals remove the observatory remains
 plausible explanation other factors such as a massive storm heavy currents or even marine animals were ruled out as potential causes owing to the weight of the instrument okay so I couldn't have done it this thing's fucking you don't blame the sharks in the Sharks I love Shar no one has a clue the station collect the data about water temperature nutrients salinity speed water flow in concentrations of chlorophyll in methane this data was used to evaluate the health of the ecosystem in and around the southwestern Baltic Sea now they say that there is evidence of other giant like underground shipwrecks gone missing most time is treasure Hunters people stealing them to basically sell for scrap or sell this thing right theoretically you don't know how to use this in you don't really care about it you want to sell it on the black market this thing is the size of a small car and is this really that song after of a
 open object of a scientific object is it what are you going to do with this is it going to be sold on the dark web at this point I wouldn't be surprised if there's just two Stoners sitting in their living room staring at it being like what the hell are we supposed to do about a bunch of bunch of Ivy out of their hair Thursday was fucked up crazy bro and I got all the seaweed in my living room
 Hoboken BisMan but the missing Observatory consists of two racks one weighing 250 kilos is 550 lb and the other 100 kg 220 pounds include a frame holding the power supply along with a heavy cable connecting the station to the coast and a frame to hold the sensors both racks were quote-unquote removed with great force from their position I would assume so now we have no clue deceived the data that was collected was court was Quantico downright part price list but they have no clue what someone would gain from stealing this and then some other state actor but they are also there's no evidence saying that unless also of course it is the great Cthulhu it could be Cthulhu let's blame it on the Russians why not very interesting and we will figure out hopefully they will figure out who stole this 1600 lb think you think that it wouldn't be that hard to find out it's all it was monitored by the government he has any clue
 the ocean scary like SpongeBob full of shit don't think he poops he better poop if you would that every time you would squeeze you would be squeezing out poop you are and what you think what happens when you actually buy I mean I'm so fucking marine biologist right there. I don't go to your fucking school I didn't have time I was busy to go to your fucking biology were playing Dungeons & Dragons that's not being busy not busy it's busy examining my imagination but I imagine if you take a natural sponges just from the ground when you squeeze it all it does come out of his shit maybe again that's a toss-up for the audience real sponges do they have penises I don't know but you know that's a great segue into this story speaking of squeezing something let's go to North Carolina Shelby please so
 all the way to North Carolina a woman was arrested after she tied up her husband and you know what she did Henry she cut off his Johnson oh oh girl I don't know what happened she was just a girl she wasn't listening to lizzo I have no idea she was feeling passion she was feeling passion why men great till they gotta be great you know I I use of heard Liz o now and I think it's wonderful I took a DNA test and I'm 100% that bitch is that what it says no man is it getting fucking chicks cut their fucking dudes penises off my baby is that what it said when they caught the Golden State killer and then he took a DNA test and I'm 100% that batch so she tied up her husband to her husband must have been scared cuz he's just like I don't even know what gives Natalie comes at you with a knife and she's like I'm going to tie you up I'm going to say just really I don't know it's really very tough to say
 because in the end I mean I don't want to be held at knifepoint but I feel I feel like we could negotiate but I feel like also at that point if I'm at knifepoint I'd like to think I'm evaluating how did we get here how did we get here well he did not seem to evaluate that very well because he ended up getting tied up not victim-blaming whatsoever of course what do we know what he did what happened do you know any other rivers name is Victoria Rabbit and his name is James frappe and a spokesperson for the Sheriff's Office released a press release saying when they arrived James is 61 years young claimed that his wife pulled out a knife and tied him up inside the garage are you what I have no idea what it was about no no no it's cuz you don't listen I have no idea what this conflict is it so she came home she pulled out the knife she tied her up she tied him up she then cut off his penis and then the authorities they were able to recover it and they did put it on
 ice like a little kids like to do if your penis is on Ice it's never good nobody never a good day even if you were just because it's sore from fucking know it's not good no matter what and he was taken to the hospital but we have no word if they've been able to attach the frankinpenis of course it's shades of John Bobbitt come to mind documentary series that came out about Lorena Bobbitt really did a good job of showing just how much abuse Lorena Bobbitt when he's a horrible person constantly capitalizing on what he believes is a funny version of Fame and because he lost his penis and he got it sewn back on the OJ Simpson of having his penis cut off but I don't know why this I mean we'll see what happens here but gives this woman gone mad or is there a lot of reasons why I can't help but think I don't know if your getting your cock cut off
 not by a stranger stranger it's more likely to DSP crazy halftime going to give the benefit of the doubt to the man who had his penis cut off at this point because this will be cut off his penis so I'm not going to be like oh my God she's a victim here it's I'm going to say the victim is the victim currently that is a very specific story and yeah watch the documentary if you haven't watched it yet honestly I get it I can understand why she snapped it had to be done but still don't call anybody speak at least this man they had his name a little bit more respect for his penis they put it on ice like like it's like it's a fine wine but with Bobbitt the stickup just stepped on it and was like that's the morning from the sky down cuz he thought it would make him gay
 so that is yet another story of a penis being cut off I feel like once a month we just get a bevy of stories like this so you know what be careful out there people are agitated people are agitated be careful out there there's no reason to cut somebody's penis off use your words using words tried it and you know what also a lady's car cut off when you go to jail right you want to get baked in a million you get that money that money he all you have to do is divorce and I don't know how much money is a frog but family had a but nonetheless but the Frog family line of flat butt jeans what about the flat butt Jean Legacy they're leaving behind Farm or Blain's Farm & Fleet those are two stores in the midwest there was a it was a family and they got into a fight Mill in Blaine and then Mill got to call at Fleet Farm in the other guy called at Farm & Fleet
 I think they didn't cut each other's fucking cock so we don't know that yet they do sell small flat butt jeans though but this story Henry this is when you want to talk about it it's it's about the French beaches cuz you're a beach baby yeah I love talk about French BJ's help me man and Henry little little do people know Henry is a beach guy you love to be chilly to roll around in the ocean I like subjecting other people to my body you have no problem doing that because you know it's nice is a nice song to round I have my fucking sexy hot wife she's in a bikini and then they have to see me next to her I know you like you take fucking spoonful of sugar to make you know you get you you are doing a good job rubbing off on me a little bit when it comes to body confidence I like to stay fully clothes from head to toe on an Amish person but you really let you let your freak flag fly out there
 can handle see my back hair that's me that's the dream maybe that's why I made it to the beach maybe all the way to the beach but Julia this comes from the illustrious New York Post killer slime that can kill you in seconds taking over France's beaches on Jackie song now we are we are living in a drama movie is President and now this shit certain is a flesh-eating virus that's happening in Florida that's right we've got this fucking bullshit let's have been inundated by lethal slime has the potential to kill sunbathers within seconds what it is a horror movie clip clip is fluorescent green slime washing up on the shore it's like the blob it is the block and six BJ's we're closed of Summer
 knee has the killer slime took over the vacation destination from the guardian it's a shame this place is let me take it back so you guys can understand it and I want to set it and proper the set set the proper tone okay it's a shame this place has come to be associated with stairs send Andre a liberal in environmental activist who warned that large amounts of green algae on the beaches that's horrifying piles of toxic algae have cover the shore on the northern coast near salt do to the over-fertilization of nearby Fields draining into the ocean according to the news outlets hydrogen sulfide gas is that can lead to loss of consciousness and cardiac arrest as washed up on the shores for decades but environmentalists say that the problem has worsened to Summer due to exceptional weather at at least two people have died so far dozens of animals this is man we got the Amazons
 we got we got the we got the ice caps melted the world is changing this is the beginning of our future where all the oceans are going to start killing us are rising up the killa it's insane but that's just weird we are living in a cartoon dystopia starting to come about we psychically projected this on to ourselves we we wanted this subconsciously for some reason an hour in it and we got a deal with it I know and speaking of dystopian future we did get sent this article multiple times but I have to do pond kit Marty the robot the headline was was accused of sexual harassment but Morty's robot it's a made-up story and also if you think about it more the robot has no hands at this point you to be sexually harassed right I mean on the internet be to Blue hear your pussy have to like be out
 October spread eagle waiting for Marty and I don't do blind or the whatever the half headed grocery boy do you have to have the remote controls I'm really Point Marty titled your vagina or he doesn't have remote controls he just he's allowed to willy-nilly wander around put he goes towards spills
 okay interesting point in point noted remember that show Hunter Road and someone a reason why we were doing our meet and greet yesterday it was I will say I love you love the people are friends out here are the funniest group of motherfukers they are great they are the best but I guess women talk about if we got a message from a fan saying oh my God I got to meet my heroes I was rather than an Otter's Pockets the meet-and-greet line for the last podcast on the left of all right this story was sent to me by a listener by I believe the name is it is a Conex okay here we go this was just a very interesting interesting letter about their magical works and talk to you about a very scary experience they did while doing a binding which I'll save for a later at
 because I want to go back to read the whole article but he sent an article that I I love this is just right up my wheelhouse
 noise coming from The Thao snooze is it Tails or is it a house hunters and alien kind this is written by Staci Matlock Bowhunters Josh Brinkley and Daniel Lucero dressed in camouflage gear looked a little uncomfortable sitting in chairs at a local newspaper cuz I like this. Of course they do I went back to Santa Fe County residents that just coming to town house after several days in rugged terrain near Chateau De La Hoya also called pot Mountain Northwest of town near Utica they had a strange tale to tell and they weren't sure of the reception but we believe now Brinkley said they went hunting for Elk being a turd aliens or something else so strange they don't know what else to call it only say these are people they're not promising things and they don't particularly believe in aliens opening morning of bow hunting season was Sunday
 September 1st the two men had gone a couple of days early to scout the area for Elk they set up along the tree line and a different sides of a field and waited after 3 hours and no help Brinkley became Restless was about 9:30 a.m. to wake up so damn early it's hard to hear these animals is Lee's I take off walking around and was looking for Elk Brinkley said you reach the top of the mountain where there's a type of white bowl left behind by a collapsed volcano he went to the edge of the southwest side nassise walk to the edge you noticed two figures he thought at first they were Hunters you're very tall shapes and side by side steering red hoods on it look like to Ribbons, doff other side to a point at the top and bottom like a banana the right side was black the left side was white and a little
 the Taurus is what kind of black it was definitely look like clothes in the middle of an oval he was just grade these weird shaped eventually come around the volcano in a find long story short they find this thing that's not unlike an encampment they said this it's this weird structure they said they both work on movie sets end up going in a gun to I can see the people work on your like that are hunters and they also would do like set deck for like or also be like literally set construction sure and he said we saw this big tent structure like a circus tent 50 to 60 ft tall coming off the left of it was a long building almost like what you would build for an archery Lane for target practice it was the third the height but really long maybe a couple hundred feet per mile away and couldn't see the bottom of the structure be watching from about a minute cuz they were driving right
 movie clip building some kind of alien ship Detroit down a little hell they lost sight of the structure for it most 5 seconds from the shed and when we talked the hill it was gone no kid that's very cool hyper hyper strength that's really the entire story I just like covering because I love those types of the alien story where they are not just straight-up Gray's or like straight up a UFO or lights in the sky at type of high strangeness will you see that there are perhaps many different alien species around us what's the closest species that would kind of fit the description that that those guys described it sounds like nothing I've heard before but if you read anything with jock Palais a passport to Magonia and his Works in Brazil you see that there are many different types of like what people say it could literally be a gray if the if we are talking nuts and bolts fucking UFOs like they came from a specific plan it and they arrived here
 then maybe it's straight up in uniform maybe it's a thing that they are wearing maybe it's maybe it's New Gear they got a new outfits well hopefully those guys have a good hunting season but maybe that explains why there was no elk out there that's what they're trying to say because it does seem strange if it is hunting season usually a correlates with that being a busy time at moving location because they were really frustrated they couldn't find any ELCA didn't really well let's just do hero of the week and we have a new theme song coming in here this theme song is by RAF Sheba and I mean I have to say towards the end of it it might aggravate you but you know what it's a wonderful song We like trying new food so here it is hero of the week
 So speaking of wildlife this year of the week is a young child in 8 year old boy who was able to survive a an attack by a mountain lion he's picked up a stick and try to Javits in the I switch an 8 year old boy in Colorado attacked by a mountain lion he's speaking out about the incident the name of the kid is Pike Carlson his parents named him bike that's cool outdoorsy get it isn't Outdoors it get so when Carlson's father first ran out he saw his son's head in the mountain lion's mouth but the mountain lion it was not about to be his day because Pike fought back up the mountain mountain lion in the head and was able to survive and so I just think this is a powerful store because it's a reminder that even when you are in Peril never give up keep on fighting absolutely
 regular old Winston Churchill I know not much not as much of a war criminal though we had was like about you and he was so cute in that movie so cute and Charming know we could still put him in jail we could still that's very possible honestly lives in New York that's maybe how he's going to die or a mountain lion attack so they can graduations you're the hero of the week for once again reminding us stay in the fight do the best you can and if you have the will to live you very well may just destroy a mountain lion
 okay now we got a couple of listener emails and I got to say these are pretty cool this comes from a not so here we go I wanted to tell you about my tumor last year after being sick for about 6 months of being told I had an intestinal blockage I found out that I actually had a basketball size tumor on my ovary called a Teratoma if you haven't heard of this before it's a type of germ cell tumor containing many different types of tissue they can be found on ovaries in women or testicles in men small
 these types of tumors used to be thought to be reabsorbed Twins or something because they can have hair teeth or fingernails it's since been debunked but most people still ask me that my tumor was mostly brain tissue and it had about a dozen teeth scattered throughout an end once I'd had a bunch of phlegm producing respiratory follicles my doctor said it exploded with phlegm when they deceptive it there are less than 25000 cases of this in the US every year and only about 1% or cancerous mine was super cancerous so it had to do a few so I had to do a few months of chemo but now I have attached a picture of my two more for your viewing pleasure I made my surgeon's all take pictures of it for me while I was under nothing would bring me more joy than to hear you describe this picture of my bad ass tumor on Side Stories okay let's take a look you know what it looks like the fucking haggis I am as eight
 I cannot post it looks like what's the my God I'm freaking old is it does look like Total Recall the movie basket case I look cute but honestly and sauerkraut I need no man and there was a fucking and I had a big fucking to the multiple Anna I would eat this is going to end up how you this is this is how it like you're going to accidentally eat human flesh yes because you're just going to get tricked into doing it maybe even eat your own brain like the movie Hannibal cuz I'm at culinary Daredevil that's what they say so this is not a twin though I didn't realize that had been debunked I thought that was like kind of the whole thing with activity in the brain and all that so what else could it be why don't know
 brain think it just meet at a brain material we went to the undersea you beat the Scooby fucking surprise to Howard just how much whole my God we are just me yeah we're meatbags all right well this is a email that I will read it comes in from Jay and this is regarding JonBenet Ramsey in this subject is JonBenet Ramsey was my friend and of course we forget although she was very young six-years-old obviously she would have had friends so she writes I want to share a few experiences and a few memories of my Early Childhood that included JonBenet she and I were in the same dance class at Rec Center in Boulder and we became friends during that time she goes on to say even at a young age she was really a top talent she talks about how she had a memory of the dance instructor flipping through a CD on the stereo listening to each song for a few seconds before hitting the next to the hole
 class was standing there in the way that most six-year-olds would they were just pretty bored probably picking our noses and Shuffle in our feet but not Jon Benet she would explode into dance during short bursts of Music switching between top Jazz hip-hop and so on I remember watching her natural skill at that moment the way she was performing for no one and how spot-on she was well doing so they killed her to make room for Taylor Swift will do you think that there had to be one you think it's like a Highlander thing I think they both could have been very famous celebrities but that's a fascinating conspiracy theory also this is kind of a sweet story because apparently at one point after class they were going to meet up with John Pinette and her mother so a week or two before. John Pinette her mom and my mom and I were chatting after class there was some mention of how I need a new dance shoes to which her mom said something to the effect of oh we just got a new pair for JonBenet for her upcoming performance why don't you guys come over soon for a playdate and will give you
 your old pair let's see it let's set up after Christmas when we get back from our trip to Michigan but of course these new neckties and we could try all that is horrible that's bad that's bad know they were being sweet they were going to give her a pair of shoes away so anyway and then then also attached to this is a bit of a ghost story so I'll just read this very fast Jay Wright's fast forward to high school my brother and his friends used used to longboard around Boulder after school it was a group of four that it was a group of four that day and two of them one being my brother new JonBenet during her short life they return to my parents house after boarding and appeared that genuinely stressed and confused by something that they had seen while passing her house the group was longboarding past her house as she lived in a pretty decent all four of them claimed to have seen a v black shadow on the pavement that moved down her entire block with them kind of positioned in the center of the group it was there long enough that they were
 about it saying hey you guys see that what is that they stopped at the end of the street to look around and figure out the source the shadow slow to a stop with them and they all watched as it dissipated who knows maybe she was playing with the kids on our street as she used to in life interesting indeed JonBenet and we still have not solved this right because every year they're like somebody's admitted to it but that's why we have it right we covered it we all said like I still vaguely believe that she was killed by an outside actor I am not certain but now has a lot of people put a number and a different people are very emotionally invested in the air we don't want to wake your brother or use people wrongly I have no clue did it but yeah I know somebody did it somebody to do it that is the one thing we can say or Alexa
 over here than it is in the states so funny you mention the name Madeleine McCann for our lives show in the state's a couple of people get it but here it's it's their Casey Anthony I guess but they also know Casey Anthony here but me and the kids a very big deal here. Just laugh and throw flour they love it they just strange way in our audiences the way that we set it up they do left I was just kind of fascinating of all right thank you all so much for listening we can't wait to see you on the road in Birmingham in London Stockholm Sweden and Germany live your life like a fucking gut full of full rump face steak and it's been served papers just like you like it and maybe it was like weirdly stringy like you like that
 your taste in love the fact that the food here when you taste it it it good goes in your mouth and there was food in there but there's no taste to it and you can't do what you love that because you're from here and it's your palate and I love that you love it and other people or try to judge you but fuck that cuz you like your pace and be like the kids from the movie Hook just make it make your mind and laugh laugh laugh like you're 3 almost 40 year old men in the van traveling together needed me just talking about the countryside and we do that don't we all we love we love we love all day long it's almost as if I've gone completely unhinged
