yarn welcome to the short stuff I'm Josh there's Chuck there's Jerry the scurvy dog and this is short stuff like I said I'm already wasting time let's start yeah it's lord I can't believe this is a show for like 12 years almost 11 I think short stuff in particular in his just about approached its 1-year anniversary and it's great the little bro so let's talk about scurvy which is a disease that you can get when you don't get enough vitamin C for a long. Of time so it's got to be long. Of time if you go without vitamin C for a few days or a few weeks even you're going to be fine but if you are let's say on a pirate ship and you go months without vitamin C than your toastand technically any ship or technically any massive land movement where you don't have vitamin C in your diet for even if you just choose not to eat vitamins you can you can be flipping the middle of an Orange Grove just a total jerk but it takes about two to three months before the effects really start to set in but says it is really odd to think that like yeah I hadn't thought about that you could just remove vitamin C from your diet it wouldn't be that hard you know everyone thinks like well yeah oranges lemons limes rich in vitamin C charger but did you know if broccoli has about twice as much vitamin C is in Orange and I love broccoli and then and you hated your yes but I would eat broccoli if I was starting to show signs of scurvy I prefer to eat the oranges in the limes and lemons cuz I love me some Citrus sure me to give me a grapefruit here they're not in the grapefruit little bitter for me butI would chuck it down if my life depended on it sure you should try I've got something for you than Chuck fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice and orange juice fresh-squeezed in equal equal proportions I think I've had an accident in can have it and also think I have a thing for my childhood in the 70s and early 80s when a half a grapefruit covered in sugar was like a meal for mom's right now it just bugs me that Anne cottage cheese that was a super 70s diet thing all right so let's talk about vitamin C because it's super interesting to me that tons of animals 4000 kinds of mammals even can produce their own vitamin C but humans primates were specifically pigs and fruit bats loss of the ability to a long time ago yeah other animals can synthesize vitamin C so they don't need to ingest it like you were saying because theyhave a functioning gulo Gene the guillot no lactone oxidase Gene which is beautiful words but the guillot Jean we have a full script of its there there's just some mutation that occurred way back in the evolutionary history which is pointed to buy the fact that other Apes Kansas's synthesize vitamin C either so this happened way before humans were around it is a matter of fact the fact that they're we do have a guru Gene that is no longer functioning is pointed to is evidence of evolution by people who still argue such things but the fact that the glow Gene is there but not functioning is the whole reason we can't produce vitamin C so we have to ingest it elsewhere which wasn't a problem at least at first when we were just strictly a subtropical species like we evolved to be initially yeah cuz we were surrounded by fruits and vegetables and ate a lot but then as we do you know migrated around the globe to places where that stuff wasn't so abundantit quickly became a problem it did and so there are vitamin C pops up in other like non subtropical crops or crops that we've adapted to non subtropical climates which is to say everything outside of the tropics and subtropics right potatoes onions or another one Venture Tomatoes tomatoes and actually strangely enough some raw meat and then say like the livers of certain animals are also very rich in vitamin C which is why people living up in the Arctic Circle like Inuit populations in other indigenous tribes that lived way far north surprisingly didn't suffer from scurvy cuz they had plenty of vitamin C in their almost entirely meet Rich diet that's right it pops up in other places but if you'd if you don't get it you can't synthesize vitamin C which is extremely important to becollagen in your body which it turns up collagen is more important than just keeping your the cuticles of your nails healthy yeah we need collagen it's a protein and if you like your connective tissue in your body staying healthy and connective then you need that College in bones are going to get a lot of their strength from collagen fibers if you have like a boo-boo on your skin collagen is going to heal it it'll help the walls of your blood vessels stay strong and healthy if you like to keep your blood inside your vessels you're going to love college in another words that's right and if you are getting enough vitamin C which they say is about 75 to 90 mg a day you're going to be burning through about eight to 10 mg of this vitamin C if you want to keep synthesizing collagen right so you want to have a a store reserve a bit at all times and supposedly if your store drops below 300 mg tried to happenit's going to first start to be noticeable very faintly you're going to feel weak maybe a little bit of fatigue it's not going to be your not going to be like it's scurvy I'm a scurvy dog it's going to take a little longer and some other stuff to really to really point to the fact that you are suffering from scurvy go go to weight loss due to reduced appetite and the real dead giveaway for a lot of people is that you start to get your mouth just undergoes a massive horrifics transition in the number waste yeah it's pretty gross we're talkin bleeding gums swollen gums teeth loosening and falling out this is my worst nightmare joint and muscle pain your skin like if you you know we we talked about the college in helping the form scar tissue and he'll boo-boos you will not be able to heal your boo-boos and old Boo Boo's might reopen because they're not healing like they should be it Bones start to become brittle it's it's really himplay Bad and grotesque for sure and then eventually because you remember your blood vessels are weak and because you are episode like does the body regenerate itself every 7 or 9 Years yet but part of every generation is adequate supply of vitamin C so if you don't have that you're not answering these things and then eventually some really important blood vessels like ones that that Supply your brain or your heart with blood are going to fail and you're going to die of a blood Hemorrhage in your brain or your heart that's right so let's take a break and we're going to talk about what Pirates and sailors have to do with all this right after thistechnology is becoming more open data more accessible and the world more Innovative IBM is combining their industry expertise with the open source leadership of redhat to bring you more freedom for security more flexibility let's unlock the world's potential let's put smart to work learn more it ibm.com redhatalrighty so we kind of gave it away earlier by saying you know if you don't have vitamin C and in your in a place where you can't get it scurvy will set in early on this is a problem like during the Crusades because armies were where there were no fruits and vegetables during the Irish Potato Famine it was a big deal during the American Civil War scurvy was a big deal but the early Sailors of the world the Vikings in the Phoenicians they had fruits and veggies so they were all fine between 1500 and 1800 though and this is hard to believe it was the leading cause of Naval Death Around 2 million Sailors died of scurvy yeah like Far and Away the leading cause and it was like a really bad death like your gums will become so inflamed and swollen it would grow over your teeth so to allow you to chew your food because otherwise you just starve to death cuz you couldn't eat at the naval surgeons would cut your gums away to expose your teeth once more this is the kind of like stuff that was happening to your dying ofanother time this is say like that the age of Discovery starting around you know the late 15th century early sixteenth Century to the middle of the 18th century there were just millions of people died this way suffered from this and it's not like they didn't already know how to cure scurvy through like folk medicine here are there people kind of figured out like a few to eat an onion you're going to be fine or try some Citrus or something like that but it wasn't like widely disseminated and certainly not scientifically based knowledge until a guy named James Lin came around 1747 he I think I'm behalf of the royal Navy conducted the first controlled experiment that show that Citrus actually can cure scurvy yeah I mean James Lin comes around says you're on these boats your heart attack drinking beer and salted meat and you're dying grotesque deaths throw a lime in that beerand you'll be fine make it a Negra Modelo and seem better sort of scurvy can I mean it is really pretty easy to cure you can add like you can reverse the effects of scurvy if you add that vitamin C back in and it's really easy as that but they didn't have access to it that's why it's so closely associated with sailing right but it's still out there today it's not like we cured and eradicated scurvy I mean. I guess in a way but we didn't eradicate it because in four places where people don't have access to vitamin C low-income families even in the United States UC scurvy popping up every now and then yeah it's a really sad situation in Orange Groves were absent and people are just sitting around suffering from scurvy yet is so as as malnourishment has kind of increased because of the western diet so have cases of scurvy like in the developed Western World people get scurvy it's more more frequently seen whenever there's like a terrible famine or somethinglike that but it can't happen in people's everyday lives they can start to develop scurvy the great thing is in this is what Linda showed it way back in the 1740s is that we give somebody some orange juice or some vitamin C pills and within 24 hours their gums are going to stop bleeding within three months they should be expected to make a full and complete recovery like it's extremely treatable it's a really treatable disease it's just before James link came along and saved a lot of people from excruciating deaths there is no kind of codified knowledge about about how to cure and treat scurvy that's right then after a few months that you're completely fine it's great vitamin C nearby and it'll be a wild ride I've got two more things okayone I believe the reason why the British or sometimes pejoratively referred to as limeys is because of that lime juice rash in that the sailors got to cure scurvy Ducks end of the second thing you said that scurvy was kind of a big deal in the Civil War I saw that there was a campaign poster in Chicago I think of Union campaign poster that's a don't send your sweetheart a love letter send an onion because they knew that onions with combat scurvy that's great I think that's pretty great too great it's a great thing we should start doing that for Valentine's Dayalright truck that's it for short stuff right can't write checks it right everybody that means that short stuff is out you should know is production of iheartradio's how stuff works for more podcast from iHeartRadio is it the iHeartRadio app Apple podcasts or wherever he was into your favorite shows
