this is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service in Hong Kong clashes between police and democracy protest has have continued into the night after David saw several people injured exit polls in a presidential election suggest an independent Outsider Caillou Syed has done well in the first round 26 candidates is standing and Saudi Arabia says he'll ensure that they won't be any oil shortages despite Saturday's drone attacks on two of its biggest petroleum facilitiesalso in this podcast it's described as the richest collection of rare and unique Viking age of Jax ever find and Britain are Ireland and we begin in Hong Kong what's a cannon and tear gas being used against ground so protest is on the 15th straight weekend Avanti Kaufman's action several people were reported to have been badly injured in clashes between Pro and anti aging forces off to an unsanctioned March turned violent protests have persisted in the territory this point the decision by Hong Kong's Chief Executive Car to scrap the controversial extradition law that provided the initial Catalyst for the demonstrations this high school student explained why he came out on Sunday Alfredo video song we have to rock we have our rush to go to protest to this race and we'll have to force out the months to the Goblins correspondent in Hong Kong next week in the way that it has done over the past fifteen weekends the protests that we've seen here in Hong Kong initially there was a large Gathering we so families old and young marching peacefully through the streets with over today people would find a place plan the Hong Kong police force has not given permission for this and so lots of people thousands of them we're risking arrest but none the less they came out onto the streets but it was when the families went home but once again we saw this violence hardcore element targeted the government building in Hong Kong and motive cocktails with red at the police bricks and bustles and they then responded with some considerable Force they fired tear gas and oil soap water cannon was use we know this is an I can't take the police are trying to use to try to extinguish these protests but you know it hasn't what channel will that clear the streets for a time there is no end in sight to this protest movement the moms changing of the protesters this is why we reached a stalemate because the government has given into one demo and not many people thought they would carry on the chief executive of the set officially the the extradition Phil which spot this crisis some three long months ago is dead and it will be withdrawn but there were four of the protest has happened I think the main to full of them would be this independent investigation into the way the police have behaved over the past three months or not that we got this from Beijing I think it's highly unlikely they want political reform they wanted to be able to I like the people who run the authorities here and they want to be able to choose their own chief executive they don't like being given a short list people approved by Beijing the way they will start to use in the place in particular dealing with the demonstrators is that involving the police are taking a tough line over the past few months but I think was quite interesting is the role of China and the response not on the street not in the password for the streets but in the battle for the hearts and minds of people because we've seen pro-beijing meteorite also State media in Beijing that desperate to characterize this as a social problem about improving the the prospects for young people in Hong Kong speak to the people on the streets as we did today they don't interested in this it's not so much how much money they put in that pocket it's the sort of Life they can lead in the future and many people do not want Hong Kong to become like any other city in Maine on Sean and they won their freedom to be protected and judging from the images that seem to be a lot of calls for the UK the United States to get more involved I think this is an interesting development today we heard the strains of God Save the Queen being sung at the British Consulate not huge numbers that but people trying to make the point that the former British colonies should be better protected by the British in but this of course gives Beijing the opportunity to say what we've got here is not a hong-kong of governments meddling and you know interfering and really they're not welcome in this protest movement they would claim is being stoked and perpetuated by foreign powers in Hong Kong Beijing officials and watching developments in Hong Kong very closely with the protests on the anything on that Minds October 1st China Will Mock the 70th anniversary of

Revelations unfold across the Region 8 years ago genesia is where they begun and genocea is the only country to have really benefited from its rebuild it didn't descend into the world and the kids didn't go back to authoritarianism instead of democracy took Roots engine is the electoral campaign has been hard for the live television debates involving all the candidates pretty well unprecedented in the Arab world and it's impossible to predict the outcome of this election not something you I didn't say about elections in the Arab world for the Revolt brought democracy but it didn't deliver on my child's very deep economic and social problems and help pave the way for the revolution remain unresolved many tunisians feel they were sore today than they were before the Revolution answer in the run-up to The Verge you did get signs of a good deal of apathy people complaining about their politicians and system not really believing that voting with change that much and electoral officials have been worried the turnout might be much lower than they would like in fact they made it by the desperate plea in the afternoon around 3 p.m. to go out and make use of those Democratic rights that they fought so hard for 8 years ago I was Island Johnston Saudi Arabia's has it making sure they won't be any shortage in his own two sons of these attacks on its oil facilities and Strikes big drop in Saudi oil output for the authorities in Riyadh say they ain't reverse a third of the lost his mind Monday Riyadh says crude oil production has been constant 5.7 million barrels a day that's about Hulk the Kingdom's usual output of the European Union said the attacks on Saudi oil facilities are a real threat to Security in the Middle East has dismissed it u s allegations that it was behind the attacks houthi rebels in Yemen who are aligned with Tehran say They carried out the ocean for the Saudi bombing campaign against them see if the BBC Persian service told us more we know that the who sees have taken responsibility for the attack launched on Saudi Arabia's oil installation we know that the u.s. is not buying that version It's directly accusing your honor of being involved in the attack and even suggesting that the attacks may not have originated from Yemen itself which is what was evident and a sector pain pills tweet how credible than is the houthis claimed that they launched the attack we have to look at the map is a distance of 1400 kilometers between the border of Yemen and Saudi Arabia and the oil installations all the way up North and Saudi Arabia so to who he does manage to launch a drone that far it represents a huge breakthrough not just in their capabilities but and Iran's ability to to assisted with these a train them and give them equipment otherwise that attack could have originated anywhere from ranching from the CIA areas close to the oil installation in Saudi Arabia itself which is what some people have suggested or from the territory of your rock where you want also has his proxy forces is all of this affecting the already difficult relationship between Iran and the US you would think that it would have raised tensions between the two countries is specially after sector pain pills tweet directly accusing Iran but apparently it hasn't because even the White House spokesman they didn't rule out a possibility of a meeting again between President Rouhani and Trump next week on the sidelines of the UN Agenda just say that this attack would not help that but they haven't ruled it out they haven't called for a special u.s. Security Council session they haven't overreacted anyway that you would expect some people more pessimistic you know I look might say well that's just you know the Trump Administration being happy to use that as a pretext to sell Saudi Arabia more you know missiles and more Auntie you know anti-drone equipment and more military contracts and some people might say that it's just both Iran in the US are Eno hoping that somehow they can say face in at the same time and Gage in a some kind of a dialogue and I do and they don't want anything else to to derail that specially given that even the Saudis themselves have been accused Iran I will see you in Russian Red Cross is watching Afghanistan for 30 years but it had to freeze many of its programs in taliban-controlled areas because they said they couldn't guarantee the charity security number telephone on lifting. Bomb I move welcomed by the head of the international Committee of the Red Cross in Afghanistan on Pedro Shara South Asia editor reports for the past five months the icrc's work in Afghanistan has been limited with stuff unable to access remote rural areas controlled by the Taliban one petroshare to receive the range of programs which is being put abruptly on hold for health clinics which are in facilitating the transfer of War when the patient's facilitating the transfer of mortal remains from the battlefield to their families and projects for the benefit of communities such as Pro be safe water for people in rural areas all these activities which were taking place in areas where the intelligence app to control all disputed water put on standby all the telephones announcement at the band seem to catch the icrc by surprise that Anna just held talks with Taliban leaders and no problems of being raised some analysts suggested reveal differences between the political leadership on the group's military commission which announced the band since then they've quietly held fresh negotiations in Doha trying to rebuild trust and to address the issue which was apparently at the heart of the disagreement Taliban anger about the treatment of its flights as an Afghan prisons Mister Sheriff said it's an issue on the icrc is a gender what does a politically neutral player reaching out in its work until with the detain you want to throw it is to not to improve the situation in the in the different prisons beat intensive treatment be to in terms of conditional access to health we are not the ones responsible for the detained population better this was an issue which came out and we have been working on this house over there to see how we could increase our support to the Afghan authorities and in particular to the detention authorities in order to improve the situation understand is a complex fluid environment organizations like the icrc let's navigate fractions and divisions within the Taliban and within the government but also assess the risks from other militants including the Islamic State Group which allegedly killed six icrc work as last year that was delivering children of stars and then there are children of Legend it's a huge shadow of the American singer and actress Judy Garland talks about her mother's enduring appeal Union officials and human rights activists in Zimbabwe fair that the head of a doctors Union pizza at magens Bay has been abducted by the security forces Africa region alleged child will Ross is following the story The Association is that they received a WhatsApp message by mobile phone that said that he was being kidnapped by men so it was actually it while it was going on he managed to get this message out to say I'm being kidnapped this is what they're alleging and since then not phones being switched off he's completely unreachable and they believe there's a link between him disappearing in the role he's played in and getting doctors and nurses to go on strike so the police are investigating the mess up an interesting ly and perhaps a little bizarrely for a for a police statement that saying the possibility of 3rd Force being involved cannot be ruled out and they talked about this 3rd Force using politics in this matter to sustain what they call the human rights abuse narrative a head of the UN General Assembly meeting so what they really saying is that it looks from the police point of views though it's possible that some opposition people or people opposed to the government of Zimbabwe are either stage managing this abduction or they making the whole thing up in order to make the government look bad worrying space of abductions some of the activist who of criticize the government some people who are trying to organize protests and before they managed to get people out on the street they were arrested to stop that protest action going ahead and famously one last month that we reported on as well was that of a female comedian who done a sketch that seem to be a bit too close to the Bone for the authority as she was picked up in the middle of the night strip naked tortured and dumped by the side of the road is clear all between the Church of Scotland with a car and a treasure hunter you on the last Viking artifacts with his metal detector direct McLennan uncovered the 10th Century collection of red Viking relics in a field in 2014 National Museum of Scotland paid Mr McLennan 2 million pounds that's around 2 and 1/2 million dollars for the find and the cook which items the land it's entitled to about half the value of the bounty Pro Madden breath more I can Abra the Treasure Trove is known as the Galloway heard it described as the richest collection of rare and unique Viking age objects ever find in Britain or Ireland there are a hundred items until to the refined Mele jewelry like brooches pins and armlet there's beads and blankets made of gold silver other precious metals to and conservationists the national museum of Scotland Ave been working on these items over the past few years making the ready to go on show to the public in Edinborough from next May and then tearing around Scotland from the end of next year now they were found by my uncle Derek McLennan but now the Church of Scotland won't see it Scott what's it doing and why so the Church of Scotland has launched papers in court beginning formal legal action against Derrick McLendon who find the man who find the Viking age horde with his metal detector he had received permission from the church to search landed owned in the Southwest discount fence back in 2014 and the discovery he made then was considered as a set of huge National significance The Horde was valued at almost 2 million Pines at the church of Scotland is claiming a share of the value of the treasure because it was fine donuts and I want to start with an inside we've had no response from direct McLennan the cases of a c-note legally active but we do know that the church is is going through formal procedures because the laws are Ryan Treasure Trove in Scotland are such that it initially when an object of historical or cultural significance is find it is protected and preserved for the benefit of the nation so the rules of Treasure Trove are based on Scott's common law in that different from the law and the rest of the United Kingdom here basically any order the subject sign by chance at 3 activity like metal detecting in this case I become the property of the crime and then archaeologists establish the value of the items in this case the national James of Scotland raised the money to buy the Treasure from the finder that there seems to be an Unwritten rule here in Scotland to ensure that the finders did landowners a share of the value of Their fines for that doesn't seem to have happened in this case just a big Viking presence was there in Scotland was it a significant presence in Scotland especially in the northern Isles and around the coast and experts say this court dates back to the 10th century and the foundation of medieval Scotland Galloway that's in the southwest of the country could have been in many ways considered geographically in some ways politically Central to Ireland Scotland and England at that time but there is still a lot of mystery about The Horde researches and conservationists are trying to trace the stories of the objects by took when and where they were made as well as quiet they were buried at that time and in that place I was more like an
