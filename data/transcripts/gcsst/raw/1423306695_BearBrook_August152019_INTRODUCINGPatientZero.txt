hey there it's Jason Moon host of bearbrook I am here in studio with their Brook senior producer Taylor Quinn to tell you about a new podcast called patient zero and part of the reason I want to tell you about it is because if you'd like Bear Brook if you like the way it sounded and if you like that it was about a mystery and you going to freaking love patients hereyou may listeners May recognize Taylor Quimby as the voice at the other end of the football field when we are learning what it's like to be 300 feet away from something nope where the hell are you I thought you were there was a was an integral part in creating Bear Brook kennel out of the best ideas including that seen the whole 80s movie kid metaphor that opens the whole podcast that was Taylor's idea was it made you spend to the test tube thing for 23andMe which I'll never let him forget bad ideas from Taylor during this process and now he's got his own project and it's called patient zero and I price enough about it why don't you explain what it's what it's all about so patient zero is a podcast it's about epidemiology but but mostly it's about a specific disease Lyme disease which here in New Hampshire where we met Fairbrook is pretty big issue and it's in a spreading and generally that the number of cases is going up throughout the country and there's a lot of weird stuff when it comes Lyme disease it's kind of confusing people don't really know like how bad is it then you know how is it treated and why do people have like very different experiences with it you know if it can kill you yes I don't know what I would tend to think yes it could my first reaction would be if I don't think I can kill you do you know if it's terrible I don't believe it is from what I understand no I don't know there's also like some really interesting Mysteries I'm starting with the this room at the beginning of the story in the 1970s when it was first uncovered yeah well that's the thing of cuz I remember hearing you talk about the reporting you were doing and I was like I don't really know that much about Lyme disease in like what is this really about and then now that I've been listening to some of the drafts in the episode I totally get what you're talking about about it being so weird and hand it's like a mystery disease like instead of a killer you're looking for the culprit mean on a disease or the bug the bug that sort of Kinex medical mystery and detective work in criminology so you can even in TV shows that there's is kind of like formula to the that house m.d. the medical mystery that's very similar to the sort of Sherlock Holmes we're going to likes us out the clues and figure out what's going on differential diagnosis people found a tumor one of the suspects why couldn't you talk aneurysm stroke or some other ischemic syndrome that are Contrast MRI Crutchfield Jacobsen okay so we're going to we're going to play you a piece from from towards the beginning of the first episode and if you're interested in it you should check it out it's got its own feed patient zero podcast. Org is website on all of the places that you get your podcasts patient zero there's something you should know about the name of this podcast patient zero which may be the only term from the science of epidemiology to have breached the pop culture divided is a misnomer it was lifted from the CDC document during the AIDS crisis is 0 actually stood for the letter O meaning the patient who lived outside of California after the air was printed the media glommed on the incident turned into homophobic complicated mess the real phrase used by scientist when identifying the first documented patient in an epidemiological investigation is index case the term isn't a sexy but it's important nonetheless and index case can tell you all sorts of things about an epidemic and for this show I hoped it might shed some light on why Lyme disease is so confusing so this spring I drove to a town in Connecticut I was searching for a woman who was in her own fashion the index case that started it all the patient zero of lime world on your left see if anybody home this is where she lived in a blocky white Colonial home at the top of a Long Hill less than a mile from the banks of the Connecticut River surrounded by Sundown wild forest messy yard dog out front sorry to bug you on a Sunday the owner Glen steinmacher bought the house three or four years back didn't really know her she so she had like that one rumor here was like her doesn't look like that anymore. I don't know what she did a couple boxes he dropped him off at a town hall he tells me you're probably still there been of her old stuff at Town Hall the first selectman Steve Matson tells me to go next door to the library closed on Mondays but if I go around and knock on the back window the archivist there might let me in thank you I won't I won't be a bother well first of all if you want to lean down and get that box sure enough there on the floor wedged under a filing cabinet are two cardboard boxes one of them is filled with old papers letters journals photocopied articles it looks like a blonde to a spy or maybe a hoarder or conspiracy theorist and the other is filled with tapes cassette tapes maybe a hundred of them the library where I found this box it's in Lyme Connecticut the town where the disease found its name and this is where I first heard her voice polyamory patient zero so I may have to get another battery these tapes and papers this is her collection this is her Legacy personally came back I didn't have it but that's one of the problems is it doctors don't check for Lyme disease look for a, that moves I felt that there was some something there but the medical profession table there is no such disease that exists that has that at all this year how's it taste of Patient Zero from New Hampshire public radio hosted by Taylor Quimby find it wherever you get your podcast
