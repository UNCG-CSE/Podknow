save America I'm Jon Favreau I'm Dan Pfeiffer intermediate or another big debate last night last night in Houston the 10 highest pulling Democratic candidates appeared on the same stage at the same time is the debate that included Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders Kamala Harris Pete buttigieg Andrew Yang Cory Booker Beto O'Rourke Amy Klobuchar and Julian Castro it was the first time that buy in Warren run stage together some people thought I was going to leave the fireworks but with a few exceptions we're going to talk about I would argue that it's probably the least combative debate so far what are you what are you guys think yeah and I think there's a reason for that whichever two reasons for the first is I think everyone felt terrible after the last debate when everyone fought each other in The Hangover lasts a couple months but also everyone onstage last night cuz already qualified for the next debate there is no need to light yourself on fire to get from 1% to 2% or get another 30,000 on my daughter so they can play it a little safer despite their not being a need to do so some candidates Mayhem fire I mean right like a it's it was surprising to me in any earlier debates how nasty it got this early because generally you kind of want to be seen as nice through the Iowa caucuses because of the way the political process works there and it's nothing notable that one of the big moment I've been talking about this morning is who in cash was exchanged with Joe Biden because it was seeing is particularly negative yeah we'll talk about that a bit but it should help because I do think you could count the number of times in the opening statements and in throat the debate that candidate said look there's so much more that unites us than divides Us and how many times they all praise Barack Obama it was almost a bit of an overcorrection if we're real but I was happy about it I Quit housekeeping note if you haven't yet check out vote of America's fuck gerrymandering fund your donations will raise money for competitive Virginia State House and Senate races were the outcomes will be decided by extremely close margins and infusion of small dollar donations will have a huge impact so we only need to flip two seats in each chamber of the Virginia legislature to put Democrats in charge and then that means that the Virginia Democrats can draw Fair maps for congress when once we get to redistricting in 2021 it also means by the way that the Virginia legislature could pass another expansion of health care if they take over so we're trying to stop gerrymandering all across country walk Cherry is a great way to do it donated votesaveamerica.com Jerry that's Gerry check it out so it did start with a 30 minutes mini debate on Healthcare again we're biding criticized Warren in San Jose for the cost of Medicare for all and was joined This Time by Amy Klobuchar and Pete buttigieg let's hear clip I think we should have a debate on Healthcare I think I know that the senator says she's for Bernie I'm for Barack I think the Obamacare work I think the way and we had to replace everything has been cut at a public option guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance number one number two I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what cost are my plan for health care costs a lot of money it cost 740 billion dollars it doesn't cost 30 trillion dollars so break any new ground to remove the ball for does it seem to you guys like we're going and it's like a cul-de-sac every time we get into this just a little different has it became a conversation between Biden Bernie Elizabeth Warren Indian previous debates there has been some moderate off in the wings who is Les Mis debate whether it was John Delaney or Michael Bennett or someone else and so at least it was a conversation between by Warren and Bernie Sanders and Biden was leading the charge for his plan and being the one delivering the criticism of medicare-for-all as opposed to what's happened the past which is sort of this less relevant figure so they're getting their ass kicked by Warren or Bernie is anion Healthcare walk at the stable it did feel a little redundant to me and it's sometimes hard to follow and I do wonder how much people at home are able to follow it it was interesting to hear one of the lead candidate stopped and it's make the case against medicare-for-all for the first time I think maybe some points were scored Bernie also made an important point I thought about health care coverage generally which is this idea that under some what plants are Medicare for all that you can actually keep your private insurance if you like it that's not really true because employers have the chance to change your insurance at any time right so that it's a broader critique of the private healthcare system that was interesting I saw and heard some Bernie for folks Express frustration that Elizabeth Warren didn't more forcefully stand up for Medicare for all writ large I don't know if that's a small anecdote or the beginning of the Schism but I was notable to me I didn't I didn't notice that I thought you was pretty I thought you was pretty aggressive in her defense of medicare-for-all I think her and Bernie both make good points but like you said Bernie about how you could lose your doctor under some of these other plans and and Warren talking about her no one really loves their insurance company which is different it's a no one loves their plan Rio shoot very pointedly did not say that because some people do like their plan but I think it is pretty safe to say that no one loves her insurance company I mean yeah and she said we know what they love is you like your doctor you look your physical therapist you look your nurse the hospital you go to and under Medicare for all you would be able to keep all of that and she's all that which is very true I think we're biding rid of open up some questions around the issue of cost which we have we been so stuck on this get rid of private insurance eliminate it kick people off whatever that whatever that means but the cost we haven't really talked about a lot and I think me to buy I'm trying to point out at least you'll burn has been honest about raising taxes on the middle class to fund his plan was with Lauren has not been willing to say that and then she talked once again about and she is unwilling to talk about that she what she says is overall cost for families will go down which is true which is true but that's still people are going to get ice and people are going to get a higher tax bill and again if your employer pays a lot of your premiums and then they stop doing that because you had there's a government-run plan do you notice that savings I think it's an open question Warren has made it a big part of our strategy to reject the premise of questions are asked a Republican or conservative point of view and 95% of the time that is an incredibly effective strategy more Democrats need to do that in most of these questions are coming from a conservative point of view they are written in perspective Republican talking points in a general election but I think I'm this issue it is good this is going to be asked in every debate going for an issue is the nominee is going to be the question and it is hard for her to her was her brand has become very authentic honest policy walk to look like she is not answering this question over time because as you point out taxes and most people and she is right about the right way to frame the question yes but this is how the question is being asked and eventually I think it's going to get y'all doing this but there are going to be some people as of RN every policy every policy there winners in the make your photo has way more winners and losers when there are going to be some people whose taxes go up more than they will save in healthcare costs because they are not sicker than the doctor very often do they don't they're not interact in the house you're supposed to rain in that is it a fact and of Elizabeth Warren as president or Bernie Sanders a prisoner anyone you can put your Medicare for all the president getting there without having an honest discussion about the losers and what a small percentage of people they are putting that wall into place much harder that we learned that the hard way the only other thing I say on this is I don't know that the Medicare for all candidates have yet made an argument as to why a plan like a Medicare for America plan like Beto O'Rourke's a Kamala Harris his plan where you still have a choice of private insurance at the end if you want it are bad you know they made a pretty good case of why doing nothing is bad but you know is leaving the AC is it is as bad but I don't know if I think they've said well you don't get as much efficiency out of the system it's it's more costly overall if we still have insurance companies in the mix and that is true but I don't know if efficiencies the best argument to people who may still want that choice and I think they probably next time around have to do a better job saying no no no, let's plan our betters plan or somebody's playing the get close to Medicare for all that don't quite get there are are whiskey and back yet really it's a it's a argument against the concept of private insurance and a system where money can be pulled out of the healthcare system in the form of profits by corporations that. That's a really fundamental critique that I think requires people to step back and think bigger butt Healthcare System writ large and not necessarily about their lives their premiums for its really see meaningful Yaphank that's right we make one more point on Medicare for all of which is a point John you have made privately not publicly but it's the wasn't this podcast but is Biden's argument that was with warrants with Bernie and he is with Barack is fundamentally flawed oh thank you I would like I did my best I can in public like this to rhyme with his peace so yeah what do you say time with Moroccan and Elizabeth Warren's was Bernie I was waiting for Elizabeth Warren to respond actually there is one person last year who said that medicare-for-all is a good idea that person is Barack Obama so the idea that by saying that you want to add to the Affordable Care Act by going all the way to medicare-for-all is somehow scrapping the Affordable Care Act and like tarnishing Barack Obama's Legacy is something that Barack Obama himself does not believe he said as much for many many in a 2018 was the first time he came out for Medicare 454 that way before that he said if I could start from scratch I would have gone for the single-payer system but that we didn't start from scratch restart with the the pre-aca system adults on it yeah but yeah it was he was he was he went out further than he ever has in that in the midterm campaigns and said medicare-for-all is a good idea it makes me very uncomfortable that whether you were for Medicare for all Medicare for America or the ACA with public option is somehow a test of your support for Obama's Legacy and I think that is it is that is a cheap ends the conversation and I think it's really unfair to Barack Obama because it shouldn't we should not use a false or incorrect presumption of his position to divide the party plenty of actual policy differences between those plans to argue over plenty the most contentious moment you mentioned earlier came when who impasto criticize Joe Biden's health care plan for not automatically enrolling everyone who's uninsured in a Medicare like program let's take a listen to leave people uncovered that he wanted every single person in this country covered my plan would do that your plan would not have to buy in they do not have to buy it said that you just said that two minutes ago you just said 2 minutes ago that they would have to buy it you said they would have to buy it to buy are you forgetting what you said too many to the game 4 what's up just 2 minutes ago I mean I can't believe that you said 2 minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to but you're forgetting that that was fun so the clip started with Castro but I just we should just put out there what Biden said before that clip started early on as he's describing his plan he said quote anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare type option we have that is true that is about his plan is playing basically says if you qualify for Medicaid but you don't get Medicaid cuz you're in one of the states that didn't expand you will automatically be enrolled in a premium free Medicare program free and then later set if you lose your job you can automatically buy into this plant right so if you are hiring come but you lose your job you can then buy into his public option it is not automatic enrollment and it is not necessarily free those for some people lose their jobs that may be free if you qualify under certain income level so that's what was said so on one hand you can under send it Castro heard him say the word by but what I think is was sort of I guess on Fair about this is biting goes back and it's clearly saying no no I was talking about people who qualify for Medicaid to get automatically enrolled you were talking about your poor grandmother and I was saying she would be automatically and is Biden saying that password just keeps yelling over him and say you forgot you forgot you forgot so you know I don't think it's that big of a deal on either side is everyone said but it's still it's struck me as a bit unfair candidates go into debates with a couple of moments or singers or whatever that they want to land and it seems and I'd like to see report on this but it's Ian from watching this that Castro went in this debate looking for an opportunity to question by its capacity to sort of push on the open door of the conversation about Bynes age in his gas that has been happening on Twitter in the media in the early States and he went and did that I think this was an unfair we can have a conversation about whether that conversation is in bounds in a Democratic primary this was a poor place to land at I don't think it worked for Castro in the in the context of this debate in may hurt him in the long run tell me what is why everyone hates watching the debate cerrone's politics and Castro responded this is what the dates are for and he's right debates are for figuring out the nuances of policy holding people accountable for past statements arguing but if you come off like you're being condescending to a man who was the vice president knighted states for 8 years I think it's it's not going to read while the people I think that's a reaction your you know you kind of like had like a hey Wilford Brimley you forget your meds kind of vibe and that's human nature to see someone do that and I think you're kind of being a jerk now that said long-term what Castro's comment did and Cory Booker address this on CNN later and inmate service similar comment about Biden's natural Acuity could give reporter-news hook the cover this discussion more to talk about Biden's age for an ultimately it could hurt by now I think a discussion about ages perfectly legitimate I do think we should talk about people's Fitness for the job you offered if you're too young for it it's sparking up it is relevant to this morning saying like oh what is this about being mean to Poor Joe Biden and he's going to have to take this the general election if he's running against Trump and Trump going to be mean to him and like you know people should be able to question the front runner yes of course of course all that is true no one thinks it's going to run some kind of a nice honest campaign against Joe Biden you're so cynical that right and of course people should be able to criticize Joe Biden, Harrison the first debate went pretty hard to Joe Biden and was almost universally praised for it and went up in the polls afterwards and I think it was a completely inbounds critique of Joe but I think in the second debate Cory Booker a lot of people including us that he had the best debate and he went after buying I think I'm very Fairway in several updates on his vote for the Iraq War and it's a perfectly legitimate policy conversation that should be raised and should be discussed a special inviting is presenting himself as a person with the best experience and judgment on foreign policy but there's also the you know style points back to politics and if you kind of seem like a jerk people are going to think you're a jerk and I think it to that end in the first debate he was the first debate when Eric swalwell started like yelling about passing the torch he got roundly criticized for that end in people said it was going too far and I think they were right there to it we did seem pretty silly it's it's not about like the legitimacy of should you attack the front runner how dare you attack him he's a vice president lullaby it's not about that it's like does your critique of the other candidate a ring true and NB seem like it's coming from a fair place or does it seem like it was choreographed scripted calculated you know and look what we know is Castro's people told reporters ahead of the debate our candidate is going to go after someone at this debate we're not going to tell you the truth what would you like a clue style murder mystery 2 we're going to go after Elizabeth Warren's record on like businesses that she worked with or something like that in a telegraph that attack again like whether it's by and doing it as we're doing there anyone doing it telegraphing who's you're going to attack before the debate leaves you open to be criticized for that attacks semen phony just the way it is okay so the next big moment of the debate came in response to a question on gun safety let's listen to the answer given by Beto O'Rourke you know the critics called is confiscation are you proposing taking away their guns and how would this work I am if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a Battlefield if the high impact High Velocity round when it hits your body shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers when we see that being used against children and in Odessa I'm at the mother of a 15 year old girl who was shot by an AR-15 and watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that an AR-15 in Odessa and Midland there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time he'll yes we're going to take your AR-15 or AK-47 how to use against a fellow Americans anymore it seems to me like that might have been the best moment of the debate last night but I don't know what you guys. I thought so I mean this it was passionate it was powerful it came from a place of real emotion and the audience was responding because it was bald-headed responding to Too Much Democratic caution on guns now the people on that stage many of them has been more aggressive than more Progressive on dealing with guns and most people that Democratic party it was just a few days ago that the Democrats in the house decided they were not going to vote on assault weapons ban because I thought it was bad politics and couldn't pass the here's the thing that is I think so important about what betos and I think Castro and Cory Booker and others who have gone further into things like guns at gun licensing registration also deserve credit for but is it doesn't matter what your fucking position is the NRA is going to say you're you're coming for their God they said about Barack Obama twice we didn't take guns right they said about Hillary Clinton they said about every Democrat has ever fucking run and there is we've been arguing this for a very long time picking a position of caution to try to appease the NRA or the pro-gun crowd is it certain loser cuz they will sign a position to you that is not yours so picked up oldest position they can get the response from the people in that audience last night inspire people right don't do this out of boldness out of here yeah I mean look at you campaigning should change you as a person as a candidate right and clearly would happen and I'll Paso struck Meadows community in himself in his family deeply and it's been fairly person on finger me that answer really powerful was a way built-in you could tell he was getting actually emotional thinking about the mother of this young kid who let out who shot by an AR-15 and so yeah I think all of us like including or sick politician to sound afraid of the NRA I appreciate his moral Clarity it was also interesting that Beto got a bunch of Praise from rivals on that stage for his handling of what happened in El Paso in the way he was there for the community so you can probably interpret that has been thinking he's no longer threaten trying to be nice to him but I think it probably read to people watching at home as credit with leadership so it was a very good moment for Beto O'Rourke having a reminder people why they like them in the sacrament I also think that sometimes when you take a pretty bold aggressive position I always but sometimes doubt that most people agree with you so it wasn't just the people who who clapped in that audience last night or activist or people on Twitter but the Washington Post last week pulled a mandatory buyback of assault weapons and it pulled it 52% support in the broader public and I think like we found similar result in our Wisconsin poll even with gun licensing which Cory Booker has been out front on is all so popular like you find out all these things are more popular than we've been led to believe by pundits and more cautious Democrats when you actually pull them it's true real issues but if you haven't saw this and I'll wave my dumb fight about whether we should talk to dictators of that freaking question like that was going to go by my side the entire establishment told him you was a naive idiot then the entire countries that actually work with that guy that's one less thing about what better did which I think is interesting is it's one of and there were few other times but it's one of the rare moments in these debates wear a Moana Outlast the debate that's not about conflict with another candidate like I think Beto show last night that you can have a really memorable moment by expressing anger on behalf of people and not just anger at another candidate and I think we talked about this a few times last night to buy focusing on Trump a lot and speaking directly to jump in her opening statement and show that okay you can we can not fight our other candidates on stage but still seemed really powerful emotional effective by sort of talking about what unites Democrats and going after Donald Trump so I thought that was good that's been one of the bad Lessons Learned From the first debate was Kamala Harris is Attack on Titan which I thought was very fair incredibly well executed effective but it led to a temporary surge in her poll numbers and the lesson then was the best way to get into the top tier cuz it appeared that she moved into I talked to her was to take a shot at someone else and then that second debate everyone tried to do what Kamala Harris did answer to the last inform activate was that's not the right strategy Julian Castro who actually made this debate states by going after better or work in the first debate now believes that that is his path to getting higher than 2% of all cuz he was the 10th qualifier on that he was the last one of the stage yeah the other person the other candidate who really get this even though he's gone after buying in the past as well is Cory Booker who might be like one of the most consistent good Debaters of all the Canada has all the times that people have said the court had a good performance it's been because he's spoken positively and and you know it's not because he just goes after other people he's makes a pretty positive case he's able to be a happy warrior at all times and tell stories about real people in this community and do it with a smile and I just ate I think it comes out really well can I challenge it's okay I think right now Booker is basely playing the role that Biden did in 2008 so if you guys remember those debates not really a rough 37 of them and we hated all of them but he was on stage with Hillary Clinton I'll tell you like Joe Biden Christian I can't remember like Revell but I was like in those debates it was a little bit like last night in that there were these there was Obama Clinton Edwards for the three by four leaders in the race and they were always fighting each other and mostly Obama Hillary in Edwards was coming in against both of them could Biden was always the happy warrior and he always had good wine to be attacked Bush a republican that's where he said Rudy Giuliani was a noun a verb and 9/11 and people always left that debate loving Joe Biden but they didn't leave that debate thinking Joe Biden should be there toys for presents and I think the challenge were Booker right now it does EP though he did Booker is smart he is passionate he is very good on say she's a happy warrior but it is not clear to me what strategic objective to advance his candidacy he is accomplishing as he does that I think we can make the same argument about I think I think there's four people in this category to me Booker Beto Klobuchar and buttigieg crew I think of all and I think it's for all four of them last night turned in very good to be performances and afterwards I was wondering okay what is it that's going to help you break into that top tier because I also think you can argue we talk about this later or now that the sort of understudy crowd may have over performed the top three FrontRunner last night just in last night's debate those four candidates I mentioned anything, I turned in a pretty solid debate as well it's kind of hard to figure out where to put her twins by two point where that leaves them and how they actually break in it that's a good point I didn't speak for the first 40 minutes so it's Heights Cafe it's hard to say all he had a great debate but then at the end he got this goofy question about the Amazon and veganism and he didn't take the bait on it and then actually became the only came in on stage to talk about Afghanistan and how we need to take care of veterans when they come back so I look out that was smart and it was thoughtful in his notice in the veterans community enough to your point Dan will this help them become the nominee I have no idea there's no indication that it has two dates I think if a diesel I with us right now is campaign manager you say their plan is to organize organize it get hot later and they're just kind of laying the groundwork but you know we'll see like I can look at that field I can say I know exactly what Amy Klobuchar was trying to do yes and she was like you we can have a conversation about how sexy she wasn't doing it but she was making a moderate electability case she was picking Elaine and she was running in it I think I know what he wanted to do not sure it was complex but he wanted to continue he wanted to be the young modern alternative to the three people to top of the stage if use if you think I'm in Bernie or too far left to win and you think Biden is too old or damaged when Peters your guy Beto was very specifically trying to recapture the magic of his Senate race which is about being an inspirational movement candidate they can get people fired up and is willing to say things that other politicians want the bullshit of politics what drove in a in a made him a national celebrity was that answer on Colin Kaepernick and the senate race this was a similar thing the broker what is a mystery to me yeah it's like the second electable Progressive alternative to the top three a little bit I don't know I think that they automatic message will break through and see what people want in the face of the Trump organization maybe that's right maybe throw in their argument is it Booker has been delivering that message for his whole life and not just part of this campaign so I guess I have a long record attached I think that's what they're going for Dan breaking

personal favorite answer of the night which also came during the gun safety section from Elizabeth Warren straight and unless we're willing to address that head-on and roll back the filibuster we're not going to get anything done on done I was in the United States that a cat sound effects for senators said let's do background checks let's get rid of assault weapons and with 54 Senators failed because of the filibuster until we attack the systemic problems we can't get done with board in this country, we've got to go straight against the industry and we've got to change Congress so it doesn't just work the wealthy and well-connected so it works for the people was also asked about the filibuster is a follow-up and had a different response would you support ending a filibuster know but what I would support absolutely is passing major legislation the gun legislation the people here at talking about Medicare for all climate change legislation types of plateau I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen what's going on with Bernie here in the filibuster can anyone figure this out I pressed him on it when he was here he gave me the same answer about budget reconciliation what if you want to call it and having his vice-president basically just overrule the parliamentarian in the Senate to get whatever you want it pretty much seems like an elimination of the filibuster in everything but name it's so confusing for a guy who hates the system and wants to tear it down and if you don't like it was the power of the being in the Senate value just be in favor of getting rid of I just don't get it also for Bernie he sounded so sick I suck so badly to go into a 3-hour debate with barely having your voice voice but he had energy play like I said let's try to if you try to separate the substances what he said I'm saying most of medicare-for-all can be passed using budget reconciliation which is a 50 vote a measure that allows you to only require 60 votes is very limited in what can be included in a budget reconciliation measure things that have to do with the budget right basically that is how we passed the Affordable Care Act there are parts of the law that we wish we could have done that we couldn't do because of budget reconciliation rules so I don't know specifically what falls and what falls out of Bernie's Plan B A bunch of reconciliation but you could go down that path the green New Deal is a very different deal he's arguing is that when we were trying to pass the ACA and couldn't pass some elements through a budget reconciliation is that we should have had Vice President Biden at the time just over rule because he's the president of the Senate the vice president president of Senate when your party is in control but he should have just gone to the Senate and when the parliamentarian said no you can't pass that through reconciliation Biden could have just said overruled by the spuds Center president and I know just would have moved forward which we can test that out if you can do that but to me the only difference between that and completely eliminating the filibuster is Bernie's basically trying to say when a Democrat is in the has the presidency and the Senate they should be able to pass whatever they want with 51 votes but if a Democrats president and the Republicans control the senate or there's a republic rather than we keep the filibuster because then maybe they won't do the same thing I've heard of a Banana Republic Vibe I also think there is a very important argument can be made in support of a ballot in the filibuster we are democracy we shouldn't the majority should get to pick our policies and having a policy of lakes with eight not just a minority of Center is but a tiny majority of the American people because the geographic distribution the Senate where Wyoming my power is California did that fun is a measure that undermines American democracy and you can make an argument against that is an argument that I think will sell with the American people out in the Democrats to push for Philip for abolishing the filibuster can intrude brand themselves as the people who push for democracy we want to make our democracy where everyone's voice counts and Republicans are against that when you get into a vice-president overruling parliamentarian I don't know understand how you explain that to people there's another point which is some of the arguments when people yell at us or talk with a filibuster is after the president because the person can have to Lobby a lot of senators are very skeptical about this many of them were on stage last night but if you think senators are skeptical about the idea of overrule of getting rid of the filibuster which would be a change in central put in above board one I didn't feel about just completely perverting the budget reconciliation process by Fiat from the vice president's office like going to sell you don't do that no mention of Chris Coons like that you're absolutely risks to eliminating the filibuster but I will tell you with mirror a hundred percent certainty that there is no time in the next 10 years or Democrats will have 60 votes in the Senate look at the states look at the map look at who's up it will not happen if you can get the 52 53 54 55 in the best-case scenarios there is no path to 60 votes at least in the next decade perhaps until there's another political realignment and all the parties change place in demographics of whatever it is just not going to happen so that Democrats will never be able to pass another piece of progressive legislation or even moderately Progressive legislation again because you're worried what Mitch McConnell will do if he gets rid of the filibuster than like that's acceptable but just know we will never be able to pass anything ever the only way that's why it was so important I think that it was with one brought this up in the gun control conversation because the only way that we are going to have a real serious control things like assault weapons ban sore buyback or Medicare for all this war at war for teachers or any of this stuff the only path is 60 volts is intriguing becomes president ordered everyone to leave the coasts they move in with and now we got a lot of California living in Idaho construction on trade which shockingly was the only time that anything about the economy was mentioned at all let's listen to Amy Klobuchar taking Dan's advice hear what we've got right now though it's not a focus tariff on steel what he has done here he has a sassy tariffs on our allies he's put us in the middle of his trade war and he is treating are farmers and our workers like poker chips and one of his bankrupt casinos and if we are not careful he is going to bankrupt this country one forecast recently says that it is already cost us $300,000. All right is soy beans that are mounting up in Ben's all over the Midwest in my state of Minnesota and in Iowa so what I think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table that's what I would do I wouldn't have put all these tariffs in place and I wouldn't have had a trade policy where on August 1st he announces he's going to have tariffs on 300 billion dollars of good on August 13th he cuts it in half a week later he says he's going to reduce tax the day after that he says he's going to do it but leaders of the world are watching this and it undermines our strength is a nation and yes we weren't fair trade but we must work with the rest of the world and he has made a mockery of focus trade policy which I think means in Portsmouth like we've done in northern Minnesota passing bills getting President Obama to do more on that so that our workers can benefit so we are importing exporting goods and making sure that is a competitive policy where our goal is a brownie I'm making inventing things and exporting to the world to feeding that goes I figure I wish you'd stop after the soybeans wed to a variety of interesting but different answers almost nobody said yes I would get rid of the tariffs Amedeo actually think Julian Castro came the closest and I thought he I know we've been critical of of his exchange with Vice President Biden I thought he had a pretty good answer in China you talk to a human rights talked about negotiating away the tariffs then you also talked about the uyghurs in China just it just showed a grasp of like the issue Warren use this question I thought the most effectively because her get to her broader economic worldview which is that trade has been written and for and benefit and corporations for decades and that we need to have strong allies and we need to have you trade to get better Global standards for workers not the thing for currently negotiating which is like things we need like respect for National Property the things are going to benefit corporations only one of the reasons that Warren Sanders and Biden are in the lead-up even though they have at least warned Sanders vs Biden have very different ideologies and philosophies on this is that all of them have a pretty solid economic message or at least they talk about the economy lot and I don't know and it like I said that. Klobuchar's at least the first half of an answer there was quite good when I'm a little long but it's quite good I don't know that anyone really made strong economic argument last night or strong economic case and I was also just shocked that trade was the only question about the economy when the economy may be headed towards recession incomes haven't gone up wages are still it like what's going on here it seems like an oversight on the half of the ABC moderating staff the when I like I had yelled as loud as I could on Twitter that Democrats need it if there are a thousand jobs I was going through my phone to the TV 3/4 I didn't happen because I saved you a phone give me a phone I'm due for an upgrade for a while I also missed her saying it because I was so busy yelling about no one saying it in the group thread that I only noticed knew it because every person who has ever work for Amy Klobuchar to did I say congratulations good job I support you to call Janet Napolitano the system works the app which is in the conversation on health care but is let's not forget Donald Trump's parking president he is terrible there millions of people watching the debate we should use it as an opportunity to deliver a negative message to get about Trump like some of the ones we tested in Wisconsin that works really well like on trade for instance trade is this massive weakness for Trump both his incompetence the execution of the trade war with China but also that he's full of shit on it that he ran is this free Trader who is right now as we speak working with Wall Street and the big drug companies to try to pass a new NAFTA that helps corporations and no one said that no one said that he wants to unilaterally cut taxes for wealthy investors last night no one said that he's thinking of cutting Social Security Medicaid in his budget and Medicare as well no one talked about that either no one talked about his first big test cuz they completely failed like he paid it sort of about his General failure to negotiate with the Chinese right and then he pivoted to a conversation about Trump just not showing up to a climate change meeting at the G7 in our Global apps and so yeah people took the question to a bunch of interesting places to mention Mike Pence is very long and profitable for Trump commute and I are so happy the other issues that were brought up at all like Trump's corruption was not by me Elizabeth Warren textbookrush all the time so that's wonderful but specifically calling out instances of trump being corrupt which there are plenty specially last couple weeks exam from Pete saying that I'm so glad you did didn't hear that lady that we also know if more pulling his fucking devastating to Trump surprising given that this Democratic primary when you think that almost everyone well it's hard to know whether we're in an inquiry as well that you have sent about Reproductive Rights women's issues just sort of did Steve Jobs as if the Republican party all across the south in the midwest is not trying to ban abortion into Force 2 Supreme Court to try to overturn Roe v Wade right fucking now one would think that would be a huge issue to talk about and you just mention the Supreme Court still hasn't been a question about the Supreme Court what kind of justice is you would nominate really like huge huge fucking a for court reform it is sort of like we keep going to these all these debates we keep going having these like cul-de-sacs of around these like the same issues the same debate very sick of the Medicare for all vs. Medicare fraud I don't think it's helping anyone make a choice at this point we had it three times and you know, I'm sure you noticed like people say oh well there's a couple foreign policy questions but like for Impala he is like half the world issues in question on Afghanistan which Joe Biden use to deathly pivot to his but you know like Afghanistan was good the question. Venezuela in Latin America was interesting and kind of hadn't been asked before but yeah I mean there was Major news out of Israel this week's Bibi Netanyahu saying he was going to Annex settlements in the West Bank.

know you know what to do so since they're only 10 can it done today figured we just go through one by one here at the end to talk about how they all did let's go back to Joe Biden who we started with and obviously there's a lot of commentary today on his exchange with Castro but I actually thought his more problematic answer was it it's started it was in response to a question about the legacy of slavery and what he would do to sort of help overcome America's Legacy of slavery give me some advice president I want to talk to you and talk to you about any quality in schools and race in a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975 you told reporter I don't feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather I feel responsible for what the situation is today for the sins of my own generation and I'll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago you said that some 40 years ago but as you're staying here tonight what responsibilities do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country doctors institutional segregation in this country every time I got to buy started dealing with that redlining Banks making sure that we are in a position where they talk about education I propose that we take his nose very poor schools the title 1 schools triple the amount of money we spend from 15 to 45 billion a year give every single teacher erased raise the $60,000 bill number to make sure that we bring into the health facility the teachers deal with the problems that come from home the problems come from home we need we have one school psychology 1500 Kids In America today it's crazy the teachers are in Connemara teacher my deceased wife is a teacher they have every problem coming to them we have make sure that every single child does in fact have 3 4 and 5 year olds go to school school not daycare school we bring social workers into homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children it's not that I want to help they don't want they don't know quite what to do play the radio make sure the television the excuse me make sure you have the record player on at night make sure the kids here word a kid coming from a very poor School are a very poor background will hear 4-minute words to or spoken by the time I get there there's so much we going to go because tough ya guys I I just I don't know like I've read the transcript of that answer multiple times now just to try to like dysart's in the word salad what he was trying to say and it's really hard it's really hard so we didn't play for you is that it goes on to a conversation about Venezuela and Biden support for stabilizing the northern triangle countries I believe during the Obama administration's of how we got there I couldn't tell you either there must be going back to the first presidential there must be some social science it says that young or economically disadvantaged kids don't hear enough words and it limits our reading comprehension and vocabulary has Hillary Clinton said you can't just kind of like spout that out without the contacts and expect anyone to know what you're talking about so icy spicy trivia a bunch of Googling this morning to try to find us because the takes run sort of takes her all about her by like stumbling through this answer but I was like what is he referring to and I found it a Vox explainer about his education plan thank you guys around yes so his plan also calls for more mental health care in schools and expanding resources for families including home visiting by nurses for parents of newborns in the creation of quote Community Schools in low-income areas that are for social services doctors and other health and this is the Community Schools idea is supported by a lot of different groups and actress stuff like that so it's not like it's it's a horrible thing but he it's on Joe Biden to explain that correctly and not to just sort of like go I mean he just he just sort of fell apart during that answer and I don't like I don't know I think it does raise questions of like what do you want to talk about age or whether you just want to talk about like I don't necessarily think it has to do with age because you know Bernie Sanders was up there and didn't stumble through answers like that and you know Elizabeth Warren is around 70 years old and like bounces around up there like she's 40 so I don't criticize along similar lines of Castro in the post debate CNN interview but then he later characterizing said no this isn't like an age thing and this is something I've noticed in wondered about for a long time I can this guy carry the ball over the Finish Line was the point and I think they're trying to make you know it's electability argument as much is a fitness for the job argument if you were sitting in Biden's war room last night you probably felt amazing about the first half of the debate he was very strong on health care he was energetic he seemed in control like that that's a question that you've been answering right it is does he have the energy and Acuity to debate Donald Trump like that's been the subtext of all the conversations it's Converse what Castro brought to the debate stage in that question and Cory Booker did an interview afterwards and not so much certification of a 90-minute debate guy and a three-hour debate world and there's no way in that debate war room when he gave that answer that we just heard that everyone thought that was a good answer for that ever thought that was okay in there cuz it wasn't good I also think that this conversation is related to the fact that binds campaign his lean so heavily on the electability argument would you make that be it it's not even just that he is the most electable in this kite like mine doesn't have an electability argument like an Amy Klobuchar or a better or work as where he can be has a proven record of winning at a or C Bullock doesn't have the you just have a record of winning in red states are Battleground States Isabella where it's very blue but he's arguing that he is the safe alternative to beating drum he is our bet Chronicle best bet it when you lean so heavily on that as opposed to what you would do in the job or why you're the most experienced or able person to do the job these questions rise to the surface much faster because they've been become a question of does he have the capacity to beat drop I also think when you watched him during that answer and then he goes on and starts says I'm going to I'm going to keep talking because everyone else gets to keep talking and then goes back to Venezuela for some weird reason to think that made sense that wouldn't you know it it said to me cuz he seemed a little angry and I think that the there's a little danger with the Biden campaign we're at right now a feeling a little aggrieved that they're getting so much shit from people and you saw that the Ryan was a piece and Politico how they said you know the media hates us and it's a whole bunch of to Ryan lizza mentioned I know right, the critique that the Biden team makes of the press and Twitter I happen to agree with I understand why they're upset but also like it's it's getting them to a point where they're becoming angry and they're reacting in anger and I think that's part of what Biden's answer was about like he was pretty upset that he thought he was about to get challenge John race again and because he was he started getting his dander sounds like a little annoyed by it and it didn't it just doesn't work for them being aggrieved about this not work the subjects of the Venezuela the northern triangle money part of his answer was these clowns think they can deal with Venezuela I met with Maduro I've gotten this funding any took us on this journey that was impossible to follow as her unless you really knew his records the Venezuela to experience a rock answer he got later he had asked about Iraq war vote he first took it to Afghanistan we talked about how he posed to search an Afghanistan you sort of waves into Ubly critique of coin strategy versus counterterrorism strategy which something I only understand cuz I said in 16000 hours of Situation Room meetings in 2009 when we debated this then he referred Afghanistan really being three countries which I think is referring to the tribal areas to in Afghanistan Pakistan everyone else thought he was talking about petitioning a rock who knows that we went back to rock we tried to argue that is Iraq war vote was intended to give Bush leverage for more inspections it feels about 16 years too late for me to re-litigate what that boat was about I feel like I didn't work so well for John Kerry and then he answered concluded with analysis about the sheet and the curd not coming together to fight against Isis and like it was just a fucking mess and then Bernie comes in and says I never trusted Bush I oppose the war what were you thinking of your judgment and experience on foreign policy of the reason people should vote you were wrong about this fundamental point which is something Barack Obama did to devastating effect against Hillary Clinton so it's just it's the convoluted in this is a problem in and of itself cuz I think it's your like where is this guy going but then even when you unpack the substance of these arguments I don't think they're politically beneficial and I will just say like Joe Biden his head moments and so much as mention this went during the 08 debates where he was the happy warrior win and he certainly was at against Paul Ryan in the 2012 vice president debate and Sarah Palin in 08 right he was a Great Debaters, Joe is a happy warrior but he's also had moments and this is why I don't know if the age thing is the right critique because I think for years and years and years going back 10 20 years fighting has had a lot of these moments where he just types like sanity's we all know I know what I'm sorry I was on the caregiving I watch John Kerry do the same thing like they're so in the Weeds on their policies and their positions they talk sometimes like they're on the senate floor and they're going all these different directions at hard to follow and it doesn't necessarily have to do they just do it like having been in the senate for a long time what is what do you conclude from that though I conclude that it is it something that worries me about Joe Biden's candidacy that I've talked about before and I can I think it's not like necessarily fatal because I just said and we just talked about in the first half of debate Joe Biden can be an energetic happy warrior and he can do that but he can also fall into what we just saw at the end of last night's debate and I think against Trump that's why yes but you know it's not like he definitely can't overcome but it's it's a little like this to me and everyone has things that are worrisome about the that I imagine when they're on stage next to buy really is not just a bad thing but I think what you said Dan is right because if your whole thing is is on electability and that seems maybe a little shaky because of her performance and then you know you need something else to fall back on buying should be our community has the experience The Proven record in the relationships to undo the damage that Trump has done more effectively more official than anyone else on that stage you know that cuz you've seen him do it over decades you saw him do in the Senate you saw him do it working with Barack Obama I've made mistakes of evolved over time on certain things I'm not perfect but I've been there and I've been in the fight yeah just like you I love my grandma phone love my mail. I'm going to bring back wax let's do the DJ on the weekends I thought it was pretty solid like I said I really like that she took on Trump and and did a lot of like we have a lot of differences but what unites us is stronger and we should be talking about Donald Trump when he's not Healthcare I thought that would be a good strategy for her and she got a tough question about Criminal Justice Reform and her record on it near the question was essentially why didn't you use the power you've had as a California attorney general to fight for some of the things that you were supposed to at the time but now support not that she handled that pretty well there were a couple of times we're a little bit of a can line came out like the Hey Joe instead of saying no we can't let's just say yes we can a kind of grown to Wizard of Oz Donald Trump in office on trade policy you know he reminds me of that that guy in The Wizard of Oz you know when you pull back the curtain it's a really small dude meme you mean the wizard okay I'm not even going to take the bait Senator Harris but I'm going to take these two sentence that was funny that George is going to be and was genuinely funny yeah there's a couple of bad jokes that Amy Klobuchar talking about Houston we have a problem is unforgivable Harris's folks work for previewing that she was going to try to bring people together that was kind of lame that she would fill it was not nostalgic for the past like like by then that it wasn't you know fights on the left like Bernie and Warren were making that you was more but I guess it's Center if they really hate that word but I don't know if she succeeded at that but it is interesting that they told reporters that that their password it's for, Harris it's still the still fundamental question is for her she does the best argument against Trump by far it is clear it is Crispin is passionate you can imagine her delivering with a bad stage the other half of that equation she still lacking why her right it's like I think last night was very very good performance I think to become we almost holder to a higher standard cuz we treat her as one of the top yet we think of her as one of the frontrunners because I do believe that she has the clearest pathan what to the nomination if she can take off of anyone in this field and I think she has the ability to do it most of the conversation don't have a great answer to the wine make you could have some of the front runner but that like that is like if she can nail that piece if she can do like Warren has a great why her and pretends Trump as a president Kamala Harris has a great anti Trump in a little lacking on The Wire if you could like that was really really good when you talk about coming out I thought it was outstanding I think under appreciated for the historic nature of his candidacy I think the fact that you're very presidential candidate who made the debate stage who is in like I hate tears but he is a legitimate Contender for the Democratic nomination is on stage telling probably telling his coming-out story in a honest way like that is truly an amazing thing that no one would have expected a few years ago or maybe the last year and like that should be like I think like that should be discussing a heated up in chromatography things are always pretty good I am like but I think like it's harder than ever to break out with pretty good in it in a field this big with three you know people seeing his frontrunners that are soaking up a lot of the oxygen and you know I think he's going to need that they're sending a lot of money in Iowa to invest in infrastructure they're going to go off on TV like maybe that will get them over that hump that get you another look from other voters but it remains to be seen he's doing much better than we think cuz we haven't seen a quality Iowa poll in months yet it's weird we can see and I will pull it probably in the next month they could show him in third or in double digits and these National polls that are what we use to judge people success and failure or any relevant and be a lagging indicator of what is happening the actual states that matter so there is that possibility what is the first time in a debate that she really made the case for yourself what you said good moments another debates but you sort of saw what her strategy was she made the case I thought it was she did pretty well I thought the the story she told him to close about when she had her daughter and was kicked out of the hospital after 24 hours and that fight to get at least 48 hours for pregnant women the 40-hour hospital stay for pregnant women with what inspired hurt against public service I've never heard her tell that story before and maybe that's my fault but I thought it was incredibly powerful and it's spoke to her values and then why she was in public service to begin this really wasn't that sound you hear is me crying because how we didn't listen to my interview with Amy Klobuchar on this podcast of course I did see what happens with you where does he go from here I think you're you know what you said tell me to Addie Sue and all the folks on his campaign they just been organizing like crazy in Iowa and they sort of keep seeing probably more more than we're all seeing Force year which is promising for him and for not talking about and so let's do it he's a funny guy he comes off as likable I think that the freedom dividend is his Corps policy proposal to Universal basic income plan we've seen pulling the suggest Universal basic income polls horribly and I'm not totally sure how announcing that you're giving away a hundred twenty Grand to print is going to play with hey man credit to Andrew Yang for like being focus on the one thing that he really wants to put forward and being creative if you're looking for something different did Andrew Yang is that line everyone else on that stage is going to try to be different but that mean they're just very like like I was like Bernie Sanders is a very different politician than a Joe Biden buddy someone who has been a politician in our Consciousness for the last four years basically incredibly different back on the interpretation but he talks like a very smart and articulate one who also speaks Norwegian but he seems like a politician right so if there are nine politicians on that station is Andrew Yang and he there is there's obviously late for that because he was not only end with hulyan Castro in Amy Klobuchar and better our work and they have a beef with the media which is legitimate which is sometimes all those other can't you just mentioned are treated as like the next year Andrew Yang is left out of that but he is in a mini poles I had a community of people that are supporting his candidate their candidate in really smart ways what whenever there's a debate night Andrew Yang is trending on Twitter and their means going around like he's communicating with people where they are thanks to his campaign but also thanks to this organization that just happened from you when I was doing my book tour in 2018 before anyone else is in the race everywhere I went so naturally Andrew Yang and whenever I go to a college campus doing something last week and the kids in the class were there a lot of gang gang gang in like last it so he has like he is supposed to community he's nurtured it and like he should be like I think it's a it's a it's a bridge to get to the nomination but it's a powerful immigration story that you told him that close about his father. I know what does it have enough armor it in on the floor and coming over here for nothing his NBA takes and whatever it was NBA takes our garbage it takes only when he's really funny and like in a sort of Modern Way interviewed him in the poor guy was so sick he horrible cold but he still had a sense of humor and was funny was nice everybody's like he's a good person Castro we talked about a bunch of personal story I thought you know at one point he sort of turn the Bedouin praise him on the El Paso shooting and they gave a really strong answer on guns like there are there's versions of William Pastor that I like very much and Iris how bold and aggressive he's been on a lot of policies in this race but I do think like going into multiple debates now thinking that if I just attack someone a lot that will get me that will boost me in the polls going to Telegraph these attacks I just don't think that's going to work for him as challenges that people going to buy remember one thing about him from that debating it said fine exchange but you did have a good moment that you just referenced and where he was talking about how Latinos were targeted by the shooter in El Paso he talked about his policing in criminal justice reform plans with your thoughtful and substantive and have gone further than other so I brought him on the national stage it was his keynote speech to the 2012 convention which was a hopeful optimistic story about Americans actually the closest version of anyone is done of Obama's 2004 convention speech everyone is Trident 4 and cash only one and he took that and nothing about my ministration he deserves tremendous credit for really aggressive Progressive policies on a lot of issues he just the issue his police reform plan is incredibly important is going to explain all this is very good and I think he would be better served in being the hopefully optimistic candidate for position that he has been for much of his career rather than someone who's walking onto the debates age looking to deck someone and there was a lot to be there something wrong with anger in the Trump era but I think there is a difference between anger and righteous anger and I think what we saw from Beto on the guns with righteous anger and will be softened better after I passed with righteous anger and being angry about what Trump is doing to America, her ass is done that quite well as well as good being angry at other Democrats I think is different has a different impact in a field where all those people are well-liked by the people voters you need to win the nomination take a little angry at Bernie Sanders he seemed last night where he was really effective in the second debate last night and you know he was sick he wasn't feeling well but the sort of the yelling was a little sort of when it was a little too much last night for me I think that was probably the voice for I think he is very compelling like when he he he is authentic we've seen this authenticity for a few years now but when he's like I'm the one who wrote the damn bill Likens it works and I don't think he did himself any damage in compelling Like Bernie also has a year that is you know I think very compelling and I don't know that he is always shown that in debates but he had that gear warrant storme Warren was like a pretty solid gray performance she's but the challenge for her now is because she's always so good to really stand out a message like kick it into another gear I don't know that she's sort of stood out last night but that she was good I think she accomplished everything she wanted to accomplish and I like I hate to do like who won the debate out of that debate stronger than she walked in on her that Elizabeth Warren is the person standing between every other kid that stage and their chance of Joe Biden and no one attacks don't even buy is attacking his did not go after her like there was a debate like it's like I don't consider that debate about whether you pay for your Medicare or Medicare for all plan or weather right like that that's under attack that's an actual substance the debate about different plans but they're like everyone disliked brand, lost a fight all the time by fights with everyone only cashier fights with everyone know if I was with Lauren and Ben Smith and Ruby Cramer bus you have this piece this morning that's about Elizabeth Warren is the center of gravity in the primary I think it's really true and she's driving the conversation or legitimately afraid of engaging with her and it said I don't fully understand I think it's fear that they're going to lose the exchange not some sort of strategic Gambit that makes any sense I don't think she's really struggled with a single question from the moderators either like that's your last night the most the trickiest one was on Afghanistan when she got pressed on whether she'd bring the troops home without a p Steele if that unraveled the country and she she pivoted to a strong answer about a need for allies and she made an argument how she was sitting in Afghanistan with John McCain and asking generals about what winning looks like and no one can Define it for her and she like she can make a case for nearly everything in a way that is just thoughtful and play super strength I don't know maybe that's why they're not attacking her question for her going forward is to date she has succeeded she's the only candidate who is actually moved up in the polls by any real measurements. Went from 0 to 5 but everything else is basically the same and she went from she Boutique in second place and she did that by running a campaign where she had no fear of losing she ran without no risk aversion write the question is as you get closer to the FrontRunner status do you get more cautious as you get closer to the White House and I think that test is going to come for her because at some point she may not be second the polls she may be first in somebody's always a pulse and then how does she respond when there's more scrutiny more attacks more pressure and how does she brought in her coalition to Eden to Biden's lead and Bernie's lead in some ways with non-college-educated white voters and black voters which you know you cannot win the Democratic nomination by being the toast of every college educated white liberal what happened to someone previewing it they're going to attack her about her work for a corporation for the buy finally never never be doing these things people find the constellation advisers so it's hard to know when it's an animus thing like that whether that was a plan lake or just you verbal diarrhea from someone in you can't make the morning conference call you also go like look no Curtis in the Bible it most senators from Delaware probably not going to be the one to like carry the water on dear you're doing work for corporate interests given that your lovely state is domiciled seriously last candidate Beto O'Rourke wonderful moment you know his campaign the same answer the best fundraising of the quarter last night and there's some focus groups where people said that they like them and they were you know they fit that they are switching their vote to him from being undecided are pundits anyone like where does he go from here because he like a lot of other candidates is stuck around between 2 and 5% in some of these poles where do you go from here if your Betta I believe your Snapchat for want to catch a murderer the generational alternative to the three FrontRunner who are all 70 years of age and up and that way for a long time we thought that person was going to be Kamala Harris or people who I think Beto put himself in the conversation to be that alternative last night and if he can keep doing what he did last night and combine that with the most compelling electability story I think of anyone in the in the field and you can be the person who you don't have to be in your head in your heart you can have both you can have an inspirational can do that also win if he can nail that piece with sort of The Passion of boldness of last night that he's got a shot to be in that conversation with chance to do that after El Paso that out completely upended his campaign and he started doing things that no presidential candidate ever do like go to a gun show or go to States like ugly Arkansas which artist you know not in the in the early State process and he was pretty clear like look I'm not going to eat a corn dog on a stick and go send to the state fair when this ship hopping people getting murdered well now we can have to get back in the game and Iowa the steak fry is a week from tomorrow the Harkins at the desk of the Polk County steak fry I think he speaks first date gifts Harkins name well hurricane kind of stopped doing it and then a bunch of Polk County young Dems and activist resuscitate of the thing and now it's like digging great again but you know there's me 10,000 Democrats in a field challenge steaks listen to Canada to bed I was first can he build on this momentum and get another look from people who basically wrote him off after his campaign stumbled hard out of the gate after he wasn't in the National conversation after his fundraising kind of troll off like there is a window to get another look from those people there high winds are terrified of trump winning they want someone who is going to take it to him I think there's time but you know you got to capitalize on this momentum I think he needs to broaden the his message on guns to every other issues in to make out a larger case like there was there was a colonel this in his opening statement when he said you know I realize two things one Taco Del Paso and Trump and racism is it to I think he said something like our politics is too broken to and too small and too Petty to corrupt his rib deal with a challenge like this and I think you make that argument about every issue and you keep pounding that then you start having a roommate cuz I do think of Beto has the same challenge that, has the piece has which is on paper on their resumes who they are where they're from what they've done like you know it it makes a good argument for their candidacies but I don't think any of the three of them have fully articulated that vision and where they fit into that Vision where they fit into this moment and why then why not everyone else and I should look at the record book in that category too even though he's got a pretty consistent message message about radical love haven't quite nailed what that positive messages and how it distinguishes them from the top three Canada Sennheiser think that's their challenging you know if they have like you said, they have some time to do it but they're sort of not much not much at some point we've gone very long hair but we should have a conversation about the fact that the three front-runners in the Democratic primary are all the people who starred with the highest Name ID what that says about politics with us about the age of celebrity what it says about media and the inability of breakthrough or is it about 20-somethings candidates running for president might be a might be a simpler explanation than we think it's just a lot of fucking people and one last thing as last night except you know he's coming back for a debate number to I would really seriously think about staying in the race like whether you like I can do what they want so if you if you miss one debate if you miss a second of an October you got to start asking yourself like what am I what am I still doing what are my chances here tell me a sort of an extension of a question like are you in the race I mean sometimes the market decides whether you're in or you're out will you just get to stop raising money which would be wonderful we will talk to you guys next week by everyone
