You sound like a small ordeal and how did you get from that to where I know you do today at syndication how did you go from I did a duplex to now I Syndicate real estate by two other properties in between there in a lot by then we always do an IT consulting at the time and ID business and really want to play Sayang, because I was working some long hours and I work 80 hours a week like literally no time for family and so Tammy did Mike and for some reason you need to do something different and that's ever do something right here and deal with me I want to drag you down with me and so there's no way I can replace replace my ID with just buying you know two three four units ever used copy of your skin to raise money for the people and that's what we started back in 2013 but we start originally is a passive investor and quickly after that Iran dealI said what do you mean by passive a friend of ours was doing an apartment syndication and he asked us to invest as a passive investor in his syndication deal which just means he was doing all the work he found a deal and we were supposed to just sit back and collect the checks tonight as one of the best ways to get into the larger deal is to be a passive investor in somebody else's deal which I did I did I put up Holly work and what I like and what I didn't like it look over their documents in their executive summary ppm's all that so I got a lot more comfortable jumping stuff myself. I thinkis kind of a misconception that you're going to learn so much by doing on syndicators tell investors in my personal opinion by being a passive Esther you are not ready to become a syndicated this by being pass investor do many more things first you walk us through like maybe we should go back real quick let's go back to the earlier deals real quick 13 to 17 whatever was in there how are you managing those properties like business years it was a duplex in Mission Paw Michigan I was traveling for workyou know sometimes I days a week and coming back and shoveling snow and winter and you're dating people and so we all got an 8-hour toilets liability of 23 years old at the time and was it making that much in Sahuarita. Kind of hanging over us in we self-managed didn't have any money to pay anyone to do anything else that we did everything ourselves essential unfortunately I was out of town I had to do so and the contractor is so we unfortunately believe a lot of the tenants stories when I told us they were going to pay us and then we hear from one of the other tenants that they didn't feel they really needed to pay us cuz they thought it was just extra money in our pocket like we didn't have a mortgage on itto learn not to allow family to come in before they assign some kind of lease because then they have like this squatter's rights and getting them out is more challenging than getting a regular tenant yeah so lots and lots of Lessons Learned do you think it's easier and I and we can kind of easier to do what you were doing what you were doing that are you doing now I told you how you look at that funny I don't think it makes much difference frankly the difference is when you get into syndication you're going to raise Capital that's a whole new game I mean you're going through right now he's at several times and that's when it's like okaymy work involved in there and when we by 100 unit property there are more things from a contractual Champlain contract you have to assume Insurance more complicated but there's no question we do now I'm properties in the work is different based on what involvement you want so and that's the only day is when we were doing everything right we were the handyman we were hanging drywall after the contractors did a crappy job and we knew nothing and we did a better job right how much involvement in that kind of stuff do you like or can do to save money they're vs. how much do you want to hire out and if you have to hire it out whether it's small Properties or a large property hiring everything out to third parties it's if cost-effectiveness I guess the more units you have it logically makes sense that you can hire it out so that you can work on the business and not so much in the businessdon't start small start big if you want to be a multi-family jump in the multi families hire everything out leverage at all just focus on kind of where you guys are now which is where you got to over a. Of time and there's others as you would say divided into small steps take baby steps start with single-family do it all slowly leverage out the stuff you don't like you're not good at learn yourself as a business person where you want to be what advice do you have for people who are not yet started but are trying to figure out where they want to start my personal opinion is just by doing something you're further had a 99.9% in the world just making some sort of action which is great if we had to do it over again I would say I would have rather started larger but only if I had a partner they had done it before in bathroom that's the key and made me some mistakesI feel like you have to get those bruises from the smaller deals if you're going to get a whole lot less like you said if you have a partner who made those had those bruises right that's the secret to sidestep in that if you really want to size up that you find somebody else who's had those bruises got bumped around a little bit and somehow you know connect with them work with them get those I get that. That was that's very valuable for sure your story it so people have an idea of where you're at today and we can kind of into how you got there from that first deal so I guess what do you have right now and what kind of real said you havewe bought over 5,000 units we have about little or 4300 Lapras old pilot Thousand Years last year by states to mostly Texas and South East us and that's kind of a right now we've been changing are we still buy some pretty big big value ideals but reality is always you know mid-80s instruction the $6,000 rehabber are much easier to deal with it is okay so that's that's pretty substantial going from Ionia 13 14 15 16 17 units to Ione 5,000 or Nah 4300 let's going to walkhow you got from from there to there was a very first you first you started passing you said it was the first multifamily than you did as you guys like DP deal in Mesquite Texas to actual physical buildings that were separate across the street essentially by side street so 32 + 32 I was the first year we did one of the buildings and then as we were talking with then we realized that owns the other building as well and we convinced them to sell both to us at the same time what how did you finance that thenso we got a Freddie Mac loan on that one actually small balance loan I know it's not recourse or no personal liability that you do something bad on the different cell which with Stan Lee versus Friday this Friday you alone you don't gain rehab dollars so if you have rehab to do a small balance Freddy won't give you we have dollars in a loan we're Fanny will we didn't need a bunch of $25 per unit or rehab you're one of the three two units of built as condos or very nice construction the other ones were pretty you know nice construction as well with a financing we got anything at that time the raid was probably 4.9% and we actually end up doing a refi are not here recently very cool that you're at the second building from the same people how did that come up in conversation did you guys bring that up to Jared did you have your agent brocha can you kind of like build a bridge for how you thought we should do this to how it actually came aboutyeah that broker brought it up and I guess it was probably orchestrated a little bit frankly that they were you know I mean situation we had a potential buyer. One property oh by the way there's another property for the broker brought it up and the one property was actually did they were selling was running a little bit better than the other one so maybe I'm not sure why they wanted to give me either try and try to add some value to the other property when it was the broker we would have had no idea that they were selling I've been had that property so we can you give advice I guess what people were listening right now or at this point where you were they have a few properties that are on the 14 15 16 units in all their own work what's the coaching them like Step 1 to step 10 here at a timeyeah me the biggest problem everyone has starting out as they don't have the credibility talk to a broker and say I'm looking for property and Brandon why I haven't done any yet they're not going to give you the attention because think about it I mean I wouldn't sell it to somebody first time buyer and don't make any money unless you sell a property and sound does it make any money so number one is if you're going to try to buy you might consider a larger whatever number you want to pick out her units you need somebody we talked before about partner with them get them on your side Mavericks there a track record and I know things are fairly some things are fairly simple me you're going to struggle with certain aspects of it like okay maybe I don't know how to underwrite a deal when I can be learned I don't know how to raise money if you want to raise money those are the two biggest things people struggle with you looking at it from a new person perspective it's hard because everyone to get that quickquick meal right well I'll see you here to get our first deal is a quick hey I'm going to work with a broker I'm always going to do when I say I'm going to do I'm not going to read trade unless absolutely possible retrade meeting I go under contract and I go back to the to the cellar and say I like it I want a credit now for something and then you know how I always tell people to know don't be a jerk my sound like OK of course don't be a jerk there people that you know I see if you don't know if you want me to ask your spouse to probably tell you what you are but I'm reality is it people want to do business people they know like and trust mean everyone says that it's not always about the person that can close the deal you want to be able to have a relationship with somebody that's easy to work with we only stock Brokers you want this to be the easiest transaction you've done for both yourself and the seller and we keep any more deals because of that so you have not long-term mine saidwhich is harm in starting now not getting a position where you think you're still going trying to beg for money you don't be in a position one of the easiest ways is coming you know if you can do it legally ride by coming in somebody else's deal become part of a general partnership help them raise money but it's all about and someone is done it before. Rager track record and there a lot of things that you can do as a brand new person in the business if you have no money to add value so you need to add value like what are you well I have time to make make an effort on your own to start learning different aspects of the business and don't become a don't try to be an expert every single aspect of it take one or maybe two areas probably already know. Naturally and become really good at those I would say don't be so desperate to get into a deal quick that you're willing to partner with somebody just because they have a lot of experience you really do need to knowsure that your values align that you've done your research that they do have a track record of being somebody who maybe we'll even communicate to other people the way that you do we've had experience without a partner who is good at what he did but he wasn't tactical of how he disagreed with Brokers or with people or laugh at people in their face and that take it offensively right so you really do need to kind of dates before you marry a partner because it's a lot harder to get out of a partnership and it is a marriage nowadays it's really good to point out is that your relationship with your broker or your agent is actually a partnership been spoken of all the time like why I hired him it's his job find me a deal that's your job but takes a job they're not going to get paid for that's not a job that is a partnershipperson to our personalities match are the expectations we have the same that's the number one thing when I hear people complain in the forums or people come to me and say Hey how do I how do I get them understand what I need they never ever ever had a conversation the beginning where they spelled out this is what I would like from you just this morning on my Instagram I heard someone say my agent is all these things for me I'm looking on my own on Zillow is that normal and I just thought like why didn't you tell him in the beginning I'm expecting you to bring me Properties or I don't need you to bring me properties but I want this and it never comes up and I understand a lot of other relationships that we think are the same as this that you don't have to do that like your waiter you don't have a conversation when you first meet him saying fill up my water can I expect you to offer me drink recommendations so this is different and I think if people understand it is a partnership they will treat it the same way that they would as if someone came to you guys and said hey I want to get in on your deal is a general partner that would open a very long conversationam I going to do what are you good at where can you help me when people don't have that with their broker they almost always end up having a bad experience I love that because you know we know countless examples of people that don't have a conversation even people that are going to be part of general partnership with sounds bizarre but we seen it time and time again even recently a couple of people that we know is I'm a part was Brandon what's Brandon going to do before are you Siri or you're going to be giving away Equity spending your time money losing money potentially and you're not even doing a simple things into people enter in the Partnerships on a whim and you better and let you know that your second kind of conversation if you got everything in writing up front of your phoneDavid is who is Dwayne why you're not doing it where the consequences really good stuff like we tend to do and that was what most of our conversations are about is who should I partner with how should the partnership look what am I going to do what are they going to do and I mean a video while I was there that basically I just talked about when you're choosing an agent you should ask your agent what are you good at and what are you not good at people can ask me that I will not be offended I could absolutely tell you I am going to struggle with with empathizing with your emotions and holding your hand as much as somebody else might there's some agents that just love that but they're they're dumb as a box of rocks when it comes to running numbers but you know that you need a lot of you need somebody else if it's the other way around that Dennis sifford and that conversation almost never comes up I have to initiate that with the client every time and they they don't even realize that was a thing and now I do that with everyone when people sayyou know what should you tip when should you ask for property manager and I'm like but they already own a property easement how he done it already you just jumped into it and hope that that partnership worked out so I think that's really big what you're talking about is easy to work with being likeable have any expectations very clearly set knowing this person has a skill set that will help me accomplish my goal and I have something that will help them with theirs as well you also said something I thought was really important earlier when you mentioned that the first year you didn't really make any progress before you buy your first big deal tell me what you learned in that year that made it so you were able to pull the trigger and then I'm sure that your your success kind of snowballed from there very nervous about it I think we didn't make enough offers frankly I'm out on his background so under running deals really wasn't a major issue for me to die quickly but can also be you can sometimes be too conservative in general early on sometimes in without even thinking about itgoing to be like Star open holes all over the place right and it just kind of this comes to you early on you will analyze every single little aspect of a need so nervous about into what if this was wrong once it goes wrong so for us we didn't make enough offers initially and to we had a very poor boy to find criteria eight units okay 800 units okay we can do any how are you spending time wasting our time plus it makes you a lot better with your time either I love that you said that cuz this is something that newbies steal your hundred the right kind like the real fake I'd like to get specific before but I'll say it again and sayhey you know he Mark I'm looking for a job you be like good for you but you really can't even though I came looking for a job in the it field somewhere in like a Michigan area preferably like a fortune 1000 company or or larger you have any ideas all of a sudden your mind starts working like all how can I help this person do I know anybody that fit that criteria so when you give people General thing that answers your agent I'm looking for duplexes in this state and this price range will now of a sudden you're you're one you're seen as more serious cuz you I should never talking about using the right language of the day actually their mind starts working how do I get you that thing that you want. Yeah I have a fear of missing out but they don't want to be more specific is there like but what is a screaming deal comes along and it wasn't a duplex and Triplex so they didn't think of being so they start with a great dealknows that has been out of work it would take to try to remember that as too much I'll never do it but Brandon like to your point this is specifically what I want you said it earlier like mid-eighties construction value at Opportunity this many units now that broker has like a little Rolodex card I get to even use rolodexes anymore what you're trying to do to try to get everyone you come across to think of you when they come across the piece you need to Brad and I were just talking in Hawaii he's telling me about his business I know the things that you need for it if I meet a person who I think would be great for what he did specifically describe boom I'm going to send them right to Brandon if he was like oh I just need to know somebody really smart Thanos real estate there is no way I would ever think of him you know what the number of people we come across Masters movie theater masterpool knowing what they want some people that you won't have to work backward and say well if I would be interested in yes or no maybe maybe not there a lot of things are some investors don't likeother investors like different aspects of it they want that big huge value had other people getting freaked out my bridge loans other people love them so understanding your investor pool is critical so how did how did you balance I don't want to be Reckless and just write offers that I shouldn't be riding with I'm afraid I don't want to write off her since she was just tightening your criteria that allowed you to be confident yeah this is eating several years ago so there was a little bit more room in the market so we couldn't we can negotiate more back then we were at 39 may we end up at 4 and it still works for us so we had some classic bility another reason why that criteria thing is so important thing at Valhalla by John John Wallhow business I guess you could say is I'm systematized makes the point that most businesses are so generally just so many things to use the analogy of a graphic design company and you know they do logos and they do websites and they do a co-working to do blah blah and you everything right so they have a bunch people can do a lot of General stuff and they're generally good at a lot of things but they're not great at anything so that he makes this point in the book too if you were just focusing only on what you do best way he said define it was logo skate all you did was logos not only do you have a clear criteria that makes everyone happy like we're talking about here today is all the people can help you get better at that thing and so when it comes to dealin to ride him if you're trying to underwrite everything I was going to look at everything you're a general at everything or you're just a general if it everything but I was like no I am buying apartment complexes between 100 and 150 units in the Dallas Market all of a sudden a like your ability to analyze those deals is so much greater because you've done a hundred of them that are all the same thingyou know exactly what the water bill is going to look like in that area so true so it's also a matter of focusing like Mark mentioned your passive investors or knowing exactly what they want what they have bought before invested in before one time several years ago we were partnering with somebody trying to bring a development deal in Houston to our investors and they were a bunch of triplexes they were all going to be built together but it was a new market and it was for us and our investors it was a new market and it was a new thing it was a development and it was triplexes vs 100 units or more which is typically show them so all those things being new to our investors most of them were like you know hey I don't know if I'm interested cuz I'm confused I don't know about this there's a staying out there that says a confused mind refuses to act so if your investors are not clear what the offer is what's in it for them that that investment opportunity is just as solid as your other Investments Trinity cuz we didn't have a track record ourselves and the development or and triplexes they're not going to move forward with that so you cannot count on I have a thousand investors and they invested with me before so they're going to invest in anything I threw at them that's not true and then maybe even taking a questionnaire from your investors to find out what they would be interested in what type of Interest or returned are they looking for because based on their age based on how close they are which retirement that will kind of indicate how risk-averse they are quite a few Deals Only 5,000 units is a lot and I know that you work with other you know people that are starting to get into this people that experience you kind of seen the whole spectrum of how this works in your experience what is you found are like the few skills that really make a difference and someone being successful getting into multifamily syndication and what are some things that people think that they need to know or be I really don't okay so I think that if you or your partner is really good at Jewel analysis and you understand the rules of thumb and a different things to look out for just for example if there is one lump sum payment and that trailing 12 that you weren't going to be able to count on as being in your other income your person who is in control of the deal analysis part needs to understand all those rules so somebody on the team needs to be really good at that and then somebody on the team needs to be really good at relationships relationships with investors relationships with Brokers otherwise those Brokers are not going to be calling you and they have deals right they need to be trustworthy to be able to follow up with Brokers have regular calls with them or lunches with them how are you going to stick out to that broker from all the other investors out there who are also looking for that same as that type such a good point to top skills to have they said that and the other one is end of the day is access the money what do you have money or you can get it but it doesn't matter was real see any of the business if someone said I can go raise money I can raise you know millions and millions of dollars you are valuable to any industry in the world so you need to be able to get money some way to raise money because they're great not workers and they have a lot of relationship to log people who have money and it comes down to those people weren't ready to act when you had the offer so you raise zero and you don't really know what you can raise until you done it and you started building a track record it just a little story when I was in junior high and gym class and we are having to climb this row if I was very athletic I thought for sure going to be able to get up get up that rope really quick and I go and try it and it was a rope without knots I couldn't do it at all it's one of those things in life you just don't know until you try that such a great point is this something that stops a lot of people whether they look for their first private lender to help him on the first deal or they're trying to raise you know $29 and under something how did you guys start raising money in the beginning before you had a Tracker commit how do you do it today what are some of the tactics that use today to attract people to your company to invest in to mess with you you know I T business so I had a lot of IT professional that I had done business with so generally speaking lots of times both spouses are working in the making pretty decent money that was accessed some people there any events right we started going to meet ups and other events which you know whether it's the follow-through that everyone lacks is that they go spend 1000 hours ago in advance entire weekend there they get 20 business cards and they never follow up with people so if you can even do that one thing and be the person that filed it was someone after the event then your refrigerator much further had that one else and I would say don't be that one person at the event who is going around and just handing out the business cuz everybody trying to walk out of that event with a stack of business cards because they don't care about you there is no real interested or only interested in getting your money getting you into their deal at all costs they're not into relationship building in the back and said you need my business card that was what we got told us go handle your business card to get out of people's business cards and so you do it cuz you're supposed to I don't ever call anyone who gives me their card I don't remember them when I'm done I've never gotten a call from someone I gave my card yet it's okay I just found a way to help you and I we barely know each other I've been thinking about right so instead what I do is if I have a good conversation I think this will help a lot of people Instagram handle or what's your Facebook profile that I add him as a friend right there from that point I can look at their page and see how they legit or not right is it just like a they're obviously just trying to raise money and any don't know much about the business or is it someone I can connect with click with and it makes it easier to stay in touch because I get reminded that they exist when their stuff shows up in my feed and I talked about this I can send a message I can comment on their stuff that follow-up is so important like you said because everybody's eyeballs are on social media bring social media into your follow-up and just make it a thousand times Jean yourself Yeah we actually attended a meet-up recently and it was a girl and I'll just say she's a millennial and she says LinkedIn is back so Millennials are all hanging out on on LinkedIn so that's how she connected with me right then and there she connected with me on LinkedIn and was sending me messages of different things we had talked about during our conversation so that we could continue our relationship at that point. Follow up on your original question 2 how do you how do you continue to do it and other platforms if you don't have to email address on YouTube another guy and he got cut off her merely a percent from YouTube on social media end of the day you want to be able to get your people's email addresses stop checklist and give you the first three so you want to see the other seven and then they end up giving me your email and then you could give me check with him at least that's such a good point I think a lot of people out there I saw him Instagram influencers are Facebook people or whatever you don't own those relationships the company's Instagram Facebook and YouTube video on those relationships in tables you off they want to it anytime email address so I can phone number build your database on your own so that way no matter what happens you got something to fall back on right I hope you enjoyed Today Show but before we go any further I did want to bring in Today Show sponsor so

that to you I mean 36 or or tactics and tricks but in a good way that you use to get that person like into your I don't go fund how do you how do you get them from yeah I like doing this to be like you enough to give you a check for your wire a hundred grand to your next indication I mean how do you walk them to that Journey relationship wise investor again it's a file through hey do you mind if I send an email on a call together sometimes and we have a guy a little too just invested after three years you just invested our current deal right now 3 years every day I'm going to invest been investing just never has you know but sometimes it's being persistent and not pushy you can be push if you want you two might work for some people or not like but then understand if someone says hey I have you in a hundred thousand dollars I wanted to ask am I see what maybe you should put that across a couple deals and rather than do one DLNA is that credibility and not that you're just after the money in some cases people are in a position to invest so trying to see their perspective and not just getting the money and then you mentioned before people lying too busy people they like to having some common things that we talked right where we had several things in common which is great and happy yourself could be hay my kid my kids and dance to and you're never late ability with somebody not just business people you talked all things being equal if they like you are going to business with you or someone that they just met ya likeability factor I think it's often misunderstood by that really should be in almost every aspect of business like they do the study of people who got a raise at work I got a raise at work and it was like everything from job performance like that and like the only thing that mattered was your life like you that's what the scientific study came out the end if your boss likes you you will get a raise and promoted if they don't you want it has enough to almost nothing to do with performance what are some things I can say to a weird question but like I like you guys see what people can do to get that likability Dale Carnegie you know how to win friends and influence. Bell Lake Apartments so that when you're actually talking with somebody you actually act like you care what they're saying and not just looking around the room to see who else might be there paying attention or what other important conversations you can get in if you're really being an active listener you're going to be able to ask that person questions based on what they said so if you're going into a conversation with that intention that will teach you to be a better Communicator the best conversationalist is the one who can ask questions sit back and just listen that way that person thinks that was a best conversation they ever had because they're confident about what they know and if you're asking them about things they know which is usually themselves and things are passionate about and their kids and their dogs then they Shield good and if they feel good about the relationship going to be ready to take that relationship to maybe the next investing level for the kid and then I might give kids it's like really being conscious of what they're telling you I'm not doing now sometimes all you and your daughter working in solitude in dancing six months or a year later I might remember that you know you can't remember every single aspect is my tells you but will really set you far in advance and you haven't met a hundred people and forgot everybody already by the time when you walk out the door just try to remember two or three people try to remember the details about them so that when you go home or you go to your hotel room or wherever you are right it down so that when you can put them on social media you'll have an instant point of contact because we all know that we'll walk out and we'll be overwhelmed our brain is like yeah I said my name they said their name I'm not that person I'm moving on you completely forget any of the conversation going back to square one Kia as a singer was a conferences and I always admired him for this is every time he is a conversation with somebody gets a business card are who they are and then as soon as they walk away you'll go in detail like this is the person who had the three kids that did this thing and then he'll keep that he's so good at that because that into like a CRM whatever database or whatever but Josh is one of the best relationship people I know because that he just knows things about people that's awesome you in the business like what are you doing to me what do you do in addition to what you actually do what you love doing the witches fires you up in that role so my role in general is more of like are the meetups that we do in The Branding the marketing trying to keep in touch with people on social media just community building in general cuz I like being around people and there's some of the people we invest with our partner with live locally then if Mark and I are having a date night we might call them up and say hey y'all want to join us because Community is so important to us so that's kind of my my role I guess what I'm good at school anymore around broken relationships deal analysis the loan is backed up some asset management and operational side from me like to have some of the people here and there and actually seeing someone get their first deal like that to downplay it or anything like that but nothing like seeing someone brand-new get a 100 unit deal their first deal and now they're lights are on how excited they are when they're able to scale quickly with that second deal right that first deal is definitely the hardest but as soon as you get that you got your feet wet you've learned some stuff and then you know how to go on and systematized Bob Dylan. Pizza man trying to trying to get deals with my favorite part of the whole aspect that is fine it's like I don't know and I'm in the middle with all those things are you just like you're just everything when it comes to that stuff for what's your actual structure look like in a business a half a dozen ways people can get involved in syndication and some people want to just raise money so if you want to just put money into deals and other people I just analyzed deals so we definitely have helped without a doubt we couldn't be more right now without help at all but I also have an assistant that helps me and then we have a tech guy who handle some of our web stuff and we have a tech intern who's in a few 15 really smart but we're getting him involved in a business as well so we do have a team whether it's our own team or our partnership team or whatever questions I've been on my mind for a while so what is the typical split look like LP GP GP is general partnership no one's going to deal like that I put it all together right and limited partners are the investors so we use this phrase the loppet what is a tibia look like what do you spell Lane and I know it's the ideal specific but what's the average or normal for you to purchase price and then we'll do I usually a 70-30 split 72 investor 32 John partnership percent preferred return so they're basically they get day the Ambassador get the first 8% before we sponsor is get anything in stock at today but they get it before we get that and we don't we haven't really taken disposition fees are we five Keys although I'm only do what I can see what people do and I think there's there's value you don't make sense maybe do that and then a one and a half to 2% Acquisitions sorry I asked you which is based on the revenue collected for the months covers your overhead the ability to keep working doing deals then there's the 70% bike goes to message conclude waterfalls in your in your break out on a night that we have 50-50 depending on since we haven't we only need for I can see doing I think probably a better way of doing it frankly for us would be to give a different class so some of that invest let's say 2:50 or 3,000 India would get a higher prefer return some of the best lesson. Structure probably would make more sense for us in our business and our investor pool the reason we don't do it it goes back to the confused mind refuses art therapy is mine basically doesn't act on anything that's an investor has to read the the investor documents exactly what you're going to get versus what they get there or not going to act and then I could invest in your deal so you've got to keep it simple for most investigations you better know what are all these terms really understanding your investor pool that's great. I think it's so cute I'm working on my executive summary right now for the fun. I'm doing in like how can I make this so simple and clear that people like that makes perfect sense and house hacking because people need these like you're drawn to the Simplicity of just makes it take a three-step process all right whatever stuff you can put that into your deal I have a x IDs webinars for BiggerPockets every week and I I tell people like you might have the greatest in the world but like if you can't present your deal clearly in a concise way this may be colorful like lenders and partners your spouse like people don't want to if you like I always liked Joe like never show your spouse a spreadsheet Pizza Hut piece of information they don't want to do anything like it sounds stupid but like atichart add some color added a mic people that looks really good and it's not even about the name David I know you do the same thing with your a real estate agent clients like you go in there and get my 500-point PowerPoint but I see you like super simple like this is what I do for you this is how we get it done and it just moves out when the Chicago Cubs World Series since 1907 or whatever it was I was listening to the manager and they lasted what did you guys do different that you hadn't done before and he said I came in here and all I did was drill fundamentals players the best of the best that they're supposed to have been playing baseball since they were six years old and he said we went back to the very Basics how to bunt how to run the bases how to hit your cutoff man just stuff that you learn in Little League because we get away from that it's theirs is Tennessee complicate things because it makes you feel smarter and isolate you from everybody else and it's often times not affected that's why I ask you guys a question what are the things you've learned that from doing this that make people successful and you didn't tell me you have to go get an MBA and you have to be in Excel God and be able to craft a waterfall spreadsheet he was very relationships standout follow up right as I know your criteria is really complicated. This is most important part of a few DD's you'll be good and Brandon quoted Mark Cuban Brandon loves to go to other people but he did it which is why business is fun to me because you know you start off it and you suck and you guys would be spent a year before you got a deal and was miserable then you finally figured out these are the fundamentals we needed to learn your condition and kicked in boom success and just for those people that are listening to this it don't let yourself get intimidated by anything cuz it's almost always the simple things that are going to make you successful what's I got a couple questions before I move on to like the deal Deep dive but first how do you define success in a deal successful person or couple family what does success look like for you for me it's you know the American dream is to make a lot of money and to be able to have a nice house in trouble when you want and that's great but for me the more you make the more you can give and if you're not giving when you have a little you're certainly not going to be giving when you have a lot of money only makes bigger what's already in you if you are greedy and selfish you're going to be even greater and more selfish and paranoid the more money you have so I encourage you regardless of where you are and you are finances to be free with giving if you are recently said it's one of the very few message that I actually remember because they kept it simple do you need me to need it is. So whether it's somebody you're you're in a conversation with has something that you know somebody who might be able to help them with that that meet that need then connects them don't hold relationship so close because you want them to benefit you someday meet that need because it will eventually come back to you so for me that's more important is learning how to be a giver that's cool and creamy probably be I mean that's that's awesome for sure more around having a complete balanced switch and realities extremely challenging you do but if you can balance your you're married you're being a parent being a business person Fitness how I met all those aspects of spiritual then you're going to be a lot better in everything you do when I said don't beat yourself up when some area is in going exactly the way you want to because sometimes the season but I think that's one thing early on that I did not do I had no balance I worked my butt off I was really good at what I did any deadlines I would make no matter what it was unrealistic but I had no balance so for me we will sit here and say well now I'm finishing shoes for me you know I'm the best that I can best husband those are all things that I you know I didn't do before and now to be able to do them to me is the book The one thing Gary Keller & J Pappas and talk about there is no balance its balance seen right now I really like the simple things simple thing that stood out to me that it's okay like to go a little far one way in a little far the other way sometimes like it's it's about The Balancing Act that we do and then some people are just never think about it and you'll never get perfect balance balance all the time what is balancing those things I got one more for you before we jump to the Daily 5 and I'll save it has something to but what's been your biggest challenge so far in the world of medications and growing NASA portfolio you have today scatter my biggest challenge is learning how to balance our relationship outside of the business because we're both passionate about the business we tend to talk about the business all the time which is okay because we're both passionate about it but we are finding it difficult to really turn that off so that we can reconnect as a couple and individuals that we're not just these Business Machines always on to us or to me that's one of the biggest challenges is signing that Balancing Act to just be be us such a good point I would have you found that his help with that because I struggle tattoo on my wife and I got to go to dinner all we talk about is what a real estate deals were doing like half the rosie Rosie's what is focused on each other well we just hired a business coach who is also going to be working on that with us gas so we we are big on getting coaching in different areas of your life just to take you to that next level or something you're missing so we're hoping he will help with that we also have other friends in the business who we can kind of talk with you are also married doing it together so it's really nice being able to bounce ideas off of them to see how they're handling on their partnership in it as well that makes sense right so let's go from there has been an awesome display of 10,000 more questions on syndication I want to get too but we will see what comes up at later in the in the fire around but first let's go to the deal. hey its Brandon want to take a quick break from this podcast to invite you to this week's BiggerPockets webinar was like an online class and this week is going to be something that's really really popular around BiggerPockets how to buy small multifamily properties good looks so they can be one of the best real estate investment vehicles out there especially those were fairly new to real estate there's so many benefits to buying small multifamily properties which is why this week I'm going to be dedicating like 90 minutes I'll just direct training on how to get started with this you're the one how to find them out of analyze them out of Finance them as well as some of the dangers there's like four specific dangers I call out that you should know before you even make an offer so don't just go to biggerpockets.com multi webinar again multi so biggerpockets.com such multi webinar and I will see you there all right this is the part of the show where we dive deep into one particular deal you've done recently just had a deal in mind that we can pick a part and go into the numbers so first question what kind of deal is this I just give us an idea what kind of deal it is and also where it was located kind of property is it and where was it located North Dallas and is 255 units in North Dallas and how did you find the steel before but we had a relationship with him do do most your deals with Brokers that should have said earlier but what do I hear about the likeliness Ending by Apartments terminology between could have heard some different definitions of this off Market pocket listing broker has of relationship but hasn't licity I mean I know how do you define what is off Market in where you what do you mean by that there's an offering memorandum which is kind of marketing and there is a blasted it out this on the website it blasted out to the email list that's a listed property my mind all the other ones are just a variation of that and not listed on the website maybe they went to three people in there that they want to make us proud how I Define it to next one how much was it 15.4 million or how did you negotiate that price I frankly was a very fair price which was little surprising for the Dallas Market but we came down we got a small credit on a 350000 off I think but that was that we didn't have to do we need to do a ton of negotiation because it was already we knew it can be competitive and it was a fair price and we want to be in the beach then we did because we have agents and buying properties investors who buy a lot understand it there's this belief is your agent job to get the prices low as possible and it's not necessarily the case cuz you could have went in there and said well you're going to fight for you to get it for 10 million and someone else offers 15 and all you got was nothing is to get you the property for the best price possible so in this case you could get a hundred fifty thousand. Sometimes you have to pay a hundred fifty thousand write it to get the deal at 8 do the numbers make sense is the best question to ask as opposed to just like how cheap could I get it till the Brokers or the agents working for you to get the price down for commercial real estate like we're buying typically there is a selling broker that broker works for the person who selling a property their job is to get the top dollar they can for that seller in our world we don't typically work with buying Brokers you can if you're working if you're trying to find something out of state you know nothing about that market you don't have any boots on the ground and you just need a foot in the door to get you started in that market then it might make sense but again typical you're working with that selling broker and their dad's work the cell or not you next question how did you find the steal the deal with a group investors that we had we had to deal with before that and we knew this would be something they interested in but it was our biggest phrase at the time so our investor pool it was only just means that we can only go to people we already had a relationship with and we went to our basketball so it must be meaning we were working with accredited and non-accredited investors 506c recently and the difference between 560 you can advertise and Market but you can't take non-accredited so I made that choice power my Instagram cuz I have so many followers I thought I better go with the sea take a nap I feel bad I can't take a lot like most of my followers I couldn't even work with because the podcast and all that sit to do if I would be but you like one more than the other typically your list because after you condition them in there in there for a while then you can start offering advice what you want to do on that but that's a great point guard why did you then she looks like some more specific on it so it's 15.4 million was the purchase price did you get a you got a bank loan I'm assuming on a good portion of it and then you raise a down payment or did you raise the entire 15 from investors with just means that the seller already had been alone and we assumed it from them so I'm not alone so their proceeds are we got were 75% of the loan to cost which included some rehab dollars little unusual 60% remember was leverage and we got from the same lender with supplemental that gave us additional money OK Google I'd like a second mortgage if we're dealing with like what did you do with the property because they even though the occupancy was high they weren't quite the ranch they treated their tenants I mean horribly example we saw ourselves how bad they're treating people and then they weren't anything extra for Rehab unit so they had a hundred thirteen and they do not rehab but all the other ones and rehab and the rent roll it shows all the ranch they weren't even charging app anymore or units at River Rehab units we can do better perspective in better and Recollections things like that so that was that business plan required to rehab I was actually pretty decent property and we did rehab some exterior kind of screws do not spend some money and Landscaping and did the remainder of the Interior so what ended up being the outcome on the phone today and with about a refi for the property which we can get closer with this guy saying if you think it's worth today if your 15 which one is initially and that's what happens if you're going to the same lender they're not as aggressive as you have to go to the same lender for supplemental so they're like well alone and so kind of scratched at the refinance instead he was perfectly one must learn were you know we raised enough money was being passed before sometimes we didn't but that should be able to send you $1,000 more when you close a deal to the but we probably underestimate the amount of time and it takes the lender to reimburse us so we have to pay for things at $700,000 an hour waiting so over raising is just me and within reason and then realizing that and you know you have to condition your Masters at a bar we have to get a $50,000 out we can't pay distribution right now and it'll work out but reality is a things like that we need to know about like the department of the company put some seasonal workers in there like what's going on what do you mean really kind of understanding of Bryant what your Rules of Engagement are and I could Davis Point whether you spectromagic company hey we don't do we don't do 24 month lease if you do 12 month lease or six-month leases hey we don't do leases for seasonal workers so really kind of get more concrete on not we could have done a better job on musket answer that's a very good deal too that sounds awesome so very well let's head over to the next time in the show called the fire around it's time for the fire round you want to know my biggest mistake when I first started investing in real

BP sign up for a free account that's stessa. Com BP top of the world famous fly around these questions comes direct out of the BiggerPockets Forum they were going to fire them right at you right now did you guys go to say it so number one I'm an army helicopter pilot currently deployed my wife and I just made 170 K on the sale of our first rental property investing money most of it back in the real estate to his work for you if you could start out with a hundred 150k what you do with 150k if you're trying to start a real estate investing business if you only 150 or 250 back on regular do if they want to be passive I'd go slowly but you have to understand the basics of a deal before you invest just cuz you didn't mean you should go spend it before you come in and most people don't become agitated before you alright next question this is a very very popular threat on the forums getting discouraged everything is going wrong at once it arrives as I have 13 doors but everything seems to be going wrong at once insurance is required me to get the roof done deciding changed out and some steps repaired I've already spent all my Reserves at max out a couple credit cards it's been a terrible for months does anyone have any advice for getting through this or bringing somebody in I mean he's you know credit cards are horrible I may just end of the day right so much better off bringing another Equity guy and get 50,000 every need and give up part of the ownership of the deal where he makes all the man who decisions Again part of the equity of the deal and get our credit card from you then credit card so that's amateur night number three from Micah in Colorado how do I vet a cindicator how do I know I can trust this person with my money we have a number of questions I crave 22 questions on our website you can go download to the you ask cindicator before it's a small world so ask the people at events I have you heard this guy or whatever you want to do right but it's a small world understand that end of the day it's unfortunate but you might trust somebody and they might still end up doing something they shouldn't just reality slowly ask a questions and ask around and ask their experience your track record if they have Partners asset talk to their old Partners Dental partners by the day we don't have anything to say about it I really do so there's nothing wrong with asking and don't be scared to ask a question people see how should I ask a question yeah I had a conversation couple weeks ago with a gentleman who is a cocoon Sultan for a lake house place high-end clients with Microsoft and Google and stuff like that by some hiring fantastic and I didn't apply to this as well where he said if you think back to a bad employee you had in the past like an employer bad one and summer to call you and ask you and say hey you don't think about hiring this person for a really vital role my company what do you think of them that you be very guarded you be very careful what you said to me like you don't want to like throwing one of the bus but you'd be like it I like the like they did they did a job and they were one of your best employees that left on great terms that you had a great wish you would go to bat for them and you would sell like that person you are the best you've got a higher than they're awesome who said the number one thing he looks for when hiring somebody and I would say the similar Fiorentina cindicator is our previous client P previous people going to bat or they be safe on how they responded to the story about them I thought this blew my mind thinking that way it's like a it's exactly how I would do it it was somebody that I didn't absolutely love I would go too bad for them but I would I be very careful and very legal about it yeah so yeah previous person selling you on it take a chance that they were actually really good to them so I'm not taking credit for other people that has been refusing to provide detailed financials they sent a flyer with high-level figures but the numbers don't look right to me I've requested 3-year actual financials but the seller's refusing I've never run into this before is this a red flag yes oh my gosh yes yeah we do if the seller has a reason to give it to you if they do like my lender won't give me a loan unless you're going to do that and give me the financials so having a Reason by end of the day if you really really careful about something like that because it's not going to give you in the basic financials for the last three years you've nothing to go off of a man who knows we've been properly before we are giants of your own to know what that business should be running at I mean it's a commercial property 12 units is a business so the the financials and everything that the seller would normally provide you would give you a good base to work from but when you don't even have that there's so much more work involved in trying to figure out if this business will work for you or not she walk the property she was making you know vacant occupied you could ask them and I'll give you a I want to see you know I deposit the check I'm going to pick tenants randomly you going to tell me you show me that it actually deposited in the check checking account you can actually pull the tenants and ask them but end of the day if you're not comfortable in your gut's telling you hey there's something wrong with this I would suggest not moving forward yeah I like that cuz there's two reasons it could be that's motivating a seller it could be that they're lazy they just didn't keep good books and they don't want to have to do the work which would be better or it could be like actually bad they they don't they're not getting money that right based representing the property it's not being rented out and see what I like to do to this comes up a lot when I'm representing clients and Deals where the seller says I'm just not going to give you that and they just end my classic what do we do why I don't know what I'm supposed to thinking I like to try to create a situation that puts the onus back on the other side the responsibility on them so I would probably drop something and it says okay well if you don't give me any information I got us in the worst the price I can pay you if I have to assume I buying 12 eviction there's a price I can pay you if the financials look this way which one would you rather have and if they say what I want the higher price of great then you need to give me the financials and you can have it if not here's my offer and it looks terrible and now I've created incentive in the seller to like earn himself more money by giving me to financials if they still refuse to do that then I would just assume well that's because you are misrepresented you're not having to buy evictions basically that Pride walk away the end of the fire around before we get out of here let's head to last segment called the world famous famous for IDs are the same for every weekend on the podcast before we get to it let's hear what's going on this week over on the BiggerPockets business podcast Brandon and BiggerPockets real estate podcast listeners this week on the BiggerPockets business podcast we talked to James Anderson who co-founded an ax throwing business that brings in nearly a million dollars per year he's going to tell us all about starting a brick-and-mortar experience business and he's going to tell you how you can get your entrepreneurial business off the ground today so make sure you subscribe to the BiggerPockets business podcast will see you on Tuesday now back to your famous for I'll ride with that let's get to it for one and you have to answer this individually or together if you'd like what is your favorite our current favorite real estate-related book the only real estate-related books I've read was when we first started and that was by Ken McElroy the ABCs of real estate investing the advanced guide and then if you're wanting to self-managed she's got the management book as well it's just very simple at tells his story of how he started a while he transitioned from single-family to Apartments NY Rock ya Business book at me now if you are considering I mean it's just going to be Fall by kiyosaki's book you're really Rich Dad Poor Dad I mean consider it was the biggest influence on me personally as far as mindset perspective what about some of your guys's Hobbies working out in general I guess Marksbury very diligence and I'm trying to be diligent but I'm more dedicated on the job right now so I'm a little less diligent so we both have really enjoyed Fitness UFC while watching anime people bashing each other's faces in Waco S1 final question what do you believe that's a part of successful Real Estate Investors in those who give up fail or never get started I think it's a mindset it's not how many times you fall or try to avoid falling it's how many times you're willing to get back up whether it's business or relationships right like Mark and I have been married 24 years and it's it's It's Tricky business is tricky life is tricky but you got to learn how to work around those obstacles it like we talked earlier it's a balancing act and its being confident that you will be successful and just getting back up and trying again don't give up.
