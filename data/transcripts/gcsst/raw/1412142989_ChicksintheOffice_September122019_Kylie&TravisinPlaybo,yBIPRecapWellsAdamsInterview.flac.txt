this is state of emergency what's up everyone it's chicks in the office with r e n Fran we are giving you that Friday energy on a Thursday per usual friend how are you feeling today I feel phenomenal that's beautiful. Almost felt like you were going to break out into song but yeah I know I actually felt like that could have been a very dizzy princess moment yeah I could have been I honestly feel bad now that we are doing these podcast not drunk because it seems like people like us that way better yeah yeah that's unfortunate really unfortunate but to save that we may be YouTube video yes which is very important because we have been trying to get into the YouTube game so we started a channel we've been putting our interviews on there and we made a Jonas Brothers Vlog it is at best video you will watch Noah did an amazing question and you actually get to see us absolutely shit-faced yep pretty much and like you said we're trying again so YouTube game and there's just a formula got to file every time like Noah text us and he's like Alright What's the title of this video be and it's like the most obnoxious thing in all caps and I'm like I fucking hate you to just know that it pains me by that's what you got to do I sent a text I knew you were going to respond like I had nothing to say besides I just a banana from YouTube it is what it is people regardless of the title as we got drunk with Jonas Brothers which is facts yet and the video shows that and you guys really loved listening to us drunk so I'm sure you're going to love watching a strong as well so go onto YouTube and type in or the link in the bio and also I want to say that snow almost did not put his iconic line if he doesn't get McDonald's he's going to die into into the into the video look what he showed us the first draft of the video where this is amazing awesome and we're like you have to put in that line there's no way you can't I just hate Lois McKinnon listening to myself drunk is this even worse I mean yeah I guess that's fine but thank God it's in there it's in there so lucky to be in there Who Loved when Noah said that now you actually get to see a video of it which is even be around the office starts with the Pod Doves Cry Me a River meaning to four delegates honestly there is a very funny part that's not in the podcast we're we're just calling Noah pussy so go to YouTube or go on the link in the description of the podcast my friends where was very funny also also likes cheap real was saying you're like heartless get ready for the Bachelor in Paradise recap podcast so there's some there's gas in the video that was in the podcast now obviously there's things which of us with Priyanka there's footage with Joe in the background so that I believe is a beautiful song you can hear us all the others Great Moments in there so everybody go check that out it is totally worth it is seriously one of the best best videos you'll have to watch I promise you that but we have a jam-packed episode today we have a fat Bachelor in Paradise Bachelor ask episode we got some great times but we have a great recap 91 and 92 with Trent and Wells Adams is on the show today yeah friends so I think we should get into it by the way we recorded one separately from night to so you're going to hear it go from night 1 tonight to but it all makes sense in the end it it does if you hear it maybe last night throwing around just ignore that just ignore me. You'll know obviously what they were talking about from the contacts and we also Wells did not come in the studio he's in LA but escaped in Middlesboro it was awesome that well honestly one of my favorite interviews we've done in a while and I think hopefully we can get him in studio next time he's great Wells was amazing so I think we should just get into it for him like we said we have the Bachelor in Paradise recap night 1 and night to we talked about Kim Kardashian and making an insane amount of money in Just 2 minutes Amanda Bynes is officially back on Instagram and Kylie and Travis had a new Playboy shoot coming out and of course our interview with Wells Adams so let's get into it starting off with Kylie and Travis making your own beautiful is the ultimate form of self-care you spend 1/3 of your life and sheets don't you want them to be insanely comfortable so when you sleep sleep well on a hotel quality sheets that don't cost an arm and a leg that's why people are loving brooklinen.com Brooklyn and sheets are named the winner of the best of online betting category by Good Housekeeping and let me tell you and I both sleep on Brooklyn and sheets we absolutely love that we both got Deluxe hardcore bundle so that is a flat sheet and fitted sheet two pillowcases one duvet cover and two extra pillow cases they are so amazing I honestly I've had a better sleep Since switching my sheets to Brooklyn and they are luxury sheets towels bedding and more without the luxury Market most bedding is marked up as much 300% Brooklyn was the first DTC bedding company meaning they work directly with manufacturers and directly with customers no middlemen it just a great product and service sheets don't just feel great but they look great too and you can mix and match over 20 plus colors and patterns my brooklinen sheets are truly the most comfortable sheets I've slept on I absolutely love them so much I could not recommend them more for friends family or just treating yourself to the upgrade you deserve brooklinen.com is giving an exclusive offer just for our listeners get 10% off and free shipping when you use promo code Cito at brooklinen.com they are so confident in their product that all their sheets comforters and towels come with a lifetime warranty the only way to get 10% off and free shipping its use promo code c i t o at brooklinen.com that's B R O Okay l i n e n. Com promo code c i t o you will not regret a guy's a Brooklyn in these are the best sheets ever Kylie Jenner post on Instagram that she did a Playboy issue with Travis Scott Travis Scott loves to be famous yeah this is what it's really coming down to I I feel like I still haven't watched documentary see that's the problem here because you need to watch the documentary a toddler station where now Noah do you feel this way about Travis Scott College runs Playboy shoot Travis clearly just wants to be famous I don't know why you guys keep saying that I don't know why you think he's like obsessed with like that's how I never got that from him at all I think that's what they all know that but that's what everybody else picked up from his documentary which I said I still haven't washed it never crossed my mind once really because I multiple people that I have talked to have said that they thought the same thing about Travis Scott like you didn't really like do stuff like what the just that every shot of him was like just think he just like there was nothing and he's just like a perfectionist maybe being cool also has yet like he just wants to be cool but that also has hops are wants that I like Lil Wayne documentary it's like oh my God that's a different kind of brain like he's a genius you have any watch Travis I think there's a lot of saliva who don't go like really hard on child like Kylie and the Kardashians have rubbed off on him probably but that's what I'm saying no display but they loved you and shoots together which I love yeah I'm excited for it the picture looks good it was a sneak peek yeah just got his ass looks great she can we go out I got to look at the picture again Travis is is foley close right yeah he's wearing jeans but he has on his shirt that's why I just wanted to make sure because imagine if we were just getting like that I mean. Just before I was going to say I can imagine if they were just both naked and play boy I mean that one of you has not pouring right now but like if they were posing like that would be amazing it just I don't know it's the pleasure of sugar do that you don't think so naked with his dick hanging out with that is what that it's really naked in but his penis was hit in Kylie's like as what you're saying is very true we got you there now. I once again 1.4 and I'm going to start like us a scoreboard between points between you two I wish I could go back in time cuz it would be like 20 points I was just I was just finishing adding editing the Jonas video and there's a point where France is like yelling at me and you're just in the background girl like you that just just to amuse myself because I think it's funny to do I need a bike cheering Fran on in the background like I like trans my girl you know I'm going to have her back obviously your producer so I have your back as well but that's why to make myself laugh which I guess is just selfish I kind of just root for him because I think it's funny I mean it's probably seems like we've only had but honestly we we we love you know what we do it out of love it's like a little brother yeah kind of it is yeah like yeah I would say little brother I would say almost an older brother sometimes to me I feel like I'm always the youngest but friends for an assembly of the oldest know you okay that's what I'm typing is really like that child so that's why I should not really is an older brother but it could be in the middle I forgot the almost by brother Frankie true you are the oldest but I am I'm also the oldest but I'm also older than you so do we just go in age order right. That makes sense anyways. Just be naked but I doubt it now I feel like so I was just going to I mean at Kylie's ass is just it doesn't make any sense it'll be very interesting to see this pictures cuz her body makes no I don't think scientifically since I don't think I've ever actually asked you this question do you think it's real I don't know like I don't think we've ever actually had this conversation battle with it all the time cuz I say most the time I'm like yes I think it is real but then I don't know I'd look at other pictures and I'm like there's just no way there is just no there's just no way the pictures from her birthday and all from vacation it's it can't be real it just can't be because I just I just don't know how you can be so skinny and still maintain an ass like that you know I'm saying look at what point when you're working out so hard does your ass just disappear not disappear but get smaller that's why it's fake strong obviously cuz you're working out of town you're going to have a strong ass but I'm saying like size-wise it just seems to get bigger and bigger because it's fake it has to be fake if I don't know that it is a battle I will I will truly battle with this for maybe the rest of my life world's biggest mystery is if the Kardashian's asses are fake like everybody's thinking it most people would just say yes but I almost want to give them the benefit of the doubt I know them what don't you know about it so tell me why you don't know it's not like they all did they all did it that I'd be okay they're all fake like corny definitely real I think Chloe is real Kim and Kylie are the ones that blow my mind the most biggest Chloe was very different but once Chloe like really start until I can lose weight and I think her body changed have you seen how big Khloe Kardashian passes yes yes I have a nice bank it's real yes I will then. You know what'd you convinced me a lot of the time the only the only ones that I don't that I struggle with are Kim and Kylie which makes me think that it's just some weird like genetic freak thing okay okay that has the smallest shortening and maybe Chloe's Israel actually I don't know it's it's just I think we also see the we see the edited version every time we see their ass their airbrush they're probably lift it up a little bit in the photos you know I'm saying like when you see Paparazzi pictures of of them and bathing suits are like holy shit like that like that's it it's a girl like you Dad see everything that's going on like it doesn't look it doesn't look perfect yeah like faking perfect right yeah so maybe Chloe's is why I don't know why it's is probably so dumb and they're probably everyone they're probably all fake but it's just an in here we are like it's just the right now but it's just like the nice yeah yeah it's only just because they've been asked it's so many times if it's real or not they always say yes so they just keep hammering yes I can eventually it's just going to get into my brain that yes it's cuz they just keep saying it's real but I don't know all I know is that Kylie's ask to waist ratio is also I can't wait to see the rest of this because yeah yeah I have no idea what we're going to get now I don't either I went to the Playboy side before and there was another yeah there is another picture but it was their Instagram was just really really close up their entire Instagram now so they didn't like their last Playboy it's like a boy's last three photos are like in a row so it takes across the whole row on their Instagram it's Kylie's lips and Travis like his neck with some necklaces on he's actually got looks like a Playboy Diamond chain house T me yeah this is going to be good hopefully when tomorrow know and I said next week I don't know she said coming soon so like that's big sorry babe, call me tomorrow to be like two or three next week and could be tomorrow in a few hours you never know interesting well I'm excited for it very well there any any funny comments on it not that I saw El Chloe, two times when she writes a good morning wow okay wow shook West Lancaster all different comments damn so you think she saw it or know this is going to break the internet I'm sure they have so it definitely is going to break the internet right now I'll my god wow oh my God that's hot blessing our timeline I just screamed in class everyone was looking at me extra spicy I'm having to put my Playboy and Kylie Jenner notifications on iPhone porn hub, did Kylie couldn't we have discussed this first damn that's funny. some big news here Fran yag news Amanda Bynes is officially back on Instagram and in case you doubted if this was real or not she tweeted it from her verified account and the only reason why I didn't think the account was real was because it's called Amanda Bynes real and whenever a celebrity quote unquote celebrity has real at the end of their handle it's usually not their real account yeah it and I think she was on Instagram before like how doesn't she just have Amanda Bynes that's a good question is Amanda Bynes taken I don't know how she doesn't have her old Instagram account she still has her Twitter account account I have no idea but that's why she had to throw real on the end of it I'm waiting for the verification badge on Amanda Bynes real sure it's coming but it's crazy that we forget what happened to Amanda Bynes because oh I never forget I never crosses my mind every once in a while that damn Amanda Bynes really went crazy like Amanda Bynes tweeted that you wanted Drake to murder her pussy and we all just carried on with our lives yeah we all just wear like a cool Amanda Bynes wants her pussy all right and I just kept on living cuz it's just. really sad like it wasn't even funny or like she clearly had at the time it was funny but I'm saying looking back now it's not that funny because it's like you know that she was obviously going through a lot and she had that paper magazine cover that came out like I'm going to say maybe in the last year so yeah we're like she talked about how she just like how she looked in every acting every job she was doing and like clearly went through a very very dark time but she seems like she's coming back on social media I hope that's a good sign that she's okay yeah it is sad honestly what happened her when you really look at the facts of how everything went down she struggled with you know a lot of the child stars which goes back to what Justin Bieber talked about just ask is that you know you got under the influence of drugs you go a little crazy and in this case I happened to Amanda Bynes she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder so she obviously it was going through a lot but she graduated college recently and now she's back on Instagram so MIA she's had it on the right track hopefully hopefully she got the help she needed because I love Amanda Bynes the Amanda Bynes honestly she's the man is one of my favorite movie is obviously The Amanda Show so it's really sad when you actually think about what happened but she's back on Instagram everybody should go follow Amanda Bynes right she did just cried like you said just graduated from the Fashion Institute of Design I think she wants to be a designer I think she really loves fashion steps great that's it's like all good things yeah she's got pinkish purple hair that she's rocking a nose piercing yeah I'm trying to figure out like if she's just posting old picture you know I'm saying like pictures that she has it she's like oh I guess I could post these down because Summer Pink summer dark pink summer blot like she's got one that's just happened so the real question is what color is Amanda Bynes hair at this point in time I feel like the first photo she posted is her right now yeah I guess and honestly I'm digging the pink hair Once Upon a Time I die I Die Part II my hair pink you remember that is while I was working here I don't remember yet sometimes I think about doing it again but other times I remember how it ruined my hair always thought about that I always wanted to dye my hair purple what a ridiculous thing to do know it's really nice that you're absolutely I've always had that you always think like what would it look like because sometimes you put on a colored wagon you're like damn I going to look good that's like when Ariana Grande was on Victorious yeah I really wanted my hair to be bright red yeah yep people started dye their hair like the very light purple and almost like the gray purple like that looks really cool it is really cool but it also if baby is very quickly so fast when I dyed my hair underneath layer of my bright bright pink honestly it was honestly makes me nauseous thinking about it but the first time I had died it it was like a latest pink like the whole purple thing and it wash out so quickly so then I went very very bright pink and I hated that so you're not going to get the color you want without a washing out like right exactly and then it just seems like much more of a hassle like it even once you're over it you want to go back to your natural color but how do you even go back to your natural color you have to find feel like guess we are natural color is a ruin my hair a short. Of time but you know that's right now thank you for ending you know when Amanda Bynes has pink hair looks fantastic on her yeah exactly I think it like if she wants to rock the pink hair right now she should do it definitely Fairway so as you all have probably seen Kim Kardashian released her new shapewear solution where it's called skims honestly weibo debated buying it yeah you know what we just did not get there on time we did it at there in time because it's sold out yeah that was dumb for some reason I wasn't thinking that it would like everything would just begun like what I went to look Tuesday night everything was gone like I was like oh cuz I remember looking like she has like a tummy thong kind of situation is it going I'm down for that I would love to try that and I went and there's literally the no size is left the way you were so nonchalant about purchasing it at another time made me very nice lot like I'm okay I'll get to it was just cuz like I don't know it's been awhile since all of Kim stuff is kind of flown off the shelves like people buy it obviously but with her perfumes and stuff and some of the makeup like it doesn't sell out as rapidly but I guess people obviously were so excited about the skins that they went so fast like I buy I buy Kim Kardashian perfume like I said my sense now is Crystal gardenia by kkw like that's that's my perfume I am just I'm first of all I'm jealous that you like have a scent I decided that's my son I mean I use it like every day that's the only perfume I use I actually I have a few cents this is I don't know why I do but like and there are perfumes that I've been over the years and I really like I switch out every once in awhile like there's been some good ones I've gone from Sanford that like I have in my bag that I'll use like like a Dolce Gabbana Light Blue side of those ones that I've got in from supper but like I actually actively by and then rebuy Crystal gardenia from kkw fragrance medication I love her and I have actually never I have never bought anything from the Kardashians and I honestly this shape where was going to be my throat and it didn't shed a lot more data lock and like you said when you were talking about the tummy song yeah yeah now and make them do what Kim Kardashian is selling so I can only imagine how much better it is what it actually made to do that and I'm not just giving myself an insane right and I just seen great really great reviews from its people are really happy with it so yeah I think we play Miss A I guess hopefully maybe she'll restock at some point but they they sold out so fast TMZ said that apparently she's sold 2 million dollars and product within the first few minutes of the campaign going live she was posting on her Instagram story so I can be patient with the website because the technology wasn't able to keep up with how much they were selling cuz I keep checking something say they're sold out they're not crazy it makes me nauseous because it is so much money we have our heads around this type of money friend just two million dollars in 2 minutes it's literally like this now I know and I'm crashing is made two million dollars just in that little that little snap boom Another million dollars for Kim Kardashian this is why I can Kardashian is going to be the next billionaire in the family has to be who it was going to be Kylie first Kim Kardashian is 100% going to be the next billionaire in that Family Market town I mean listen to this line from TMZ they said our sources say the first day sales numbers are unprecedented for shapewear an undergarment Brands houses for contacts and its first year on the market Spanx made 4 million dollars in profits and skims made it half that amount and only a couple hundred seconds unbelievable real everybody knows will not everybody but if you're a girl you're probably familiar with Spanx and how popular of a brand it really is so the fact that in just their first year they made 4 million I can't even imagine how much Kim is going to make in the first year once again just like a master class in marketing just like every ad campaign that Kim has done has been Fantastic Beasts pet likes Kim's even after all the controversy with the name and changing the name and everything like to change the name people are excited about it she's using women of all different colors sizes like everything to show how amazing her shape or is that's how you get people to buy a product and it obviously people are buying it and I actually feel really left out yeah and honestly I think she's done a great job with this like you said different shapes sizes colors everything she's all skin to including everybody which is also why I love Kim Kardashian because as much as people want to think that she's like blind to what's going on I think she's very aware yet so I think that this honestly this shapewear line is fantastic which is why I made 2 million dollars in 2 minutes and why we can't buy it too bad very unfortunate for us but very fortunate for Kim Kardashian and I'm hoping that maybe they add some more stuff in his crazy imagine if I guess it's just physically possible Right like she can just always have things in stock eventually she's going to run out really like when you sell 2 million dollars worth of shape where you're going to sell out that you just don't have that much so it makes sense we'll just have to pay close attention to the next time it goes on sale it goes on sale so we can buy stuff and it's all pretty I think reasonably priced as well it's not crazy expensive I remember looking at the song that I wanted to buy was like $24 so that I can buy by like 3 all right everyone just shut your notifications for the restock I know it's just read like an absolute ad campaign for skins but that's what that's what she does she's brainwashed us what she does everybody wants it now I want it it can actually be an ad campaign because it's all sold out yeah exactly I could we can't even tell you to go buy it so you know this is weird but yeah that's it will have to wait for next one are you guys sick of using the same

last week Dean gave caylin the ultimatum to leave Paradise with him she couldn't she was trying to make a decision all the girls are just talking about how Kailyn is so in love with Dean they can't seem to figure out what she's going to do she talked to Connor she goes to talk to Connor and Connor really made every Point like she made the best ever he could have to try and get Caitlin to stay just didn't work as good a great up until the whole time in almost wasn't paying attention she's looking off into the distance Connors making all these good points I know I'm hard on Connor because I don't like his voice and that's not fair to him but I just don't like it that much but when he when he's saying all these things they can tell it is the right things you could already tell that she's like I wonder what Dean's van looks like I can't wait to be in that van and driving a crime around the country if she was gone sing like the gyno the car is kind of what you want but it is it the right decision she was scared Connor even tried to throw like the birthday thing back is like it was your birthday really trying to remind her of all the ways Dean fucked up but it did not matter even Christina talk to Dee and I was like are you crazy you sell for me say something about Christina saying to Dean be like you're an asshole why are you here she's already involved with someone else don't take that away from her Christina did you forget 3 weeks ago when Blake and Kaitlyn were together and having a good time you're like hey Blake will you give me a friendship rose you did the exact same thing leave these people alone UI Christina I really took a turn on her this season right now put your nose in places especially this one she's the only reason she's doing the Sedin is because she is mad with deeded to her last night so she obviously doesn't like being probably for reasonable reasons stick out of it like nothing even when Kaelyn and finally was like I'm leaving I'm gone goodbye I'm leaving the island it's not an Island I Just Called It an island is in my head would buy a battery on a beach Mexico once again I forgot what I was saying but once she was leaving Christina was still at call me if anything happens like I know how do you operate whatever Christina whatever I know I feel like Christina really dangerous is like projecting onto everybody else her whatever she's feeling inside something's going on and it's making her look mean and I don't like that because I like her still but we're seeing a little like nasty side yeah it was a tough I think it was a tough season for Christina I think we kind of saw that towards the end of the episode 2 but we'll get to that Dean yeah I miss you too one because just of the speed she made like the way I don't know is Blake said it best when he was like Dean is very Charming like when he says things you know he means it is just like will he be able to follow through so it seemed like even with Blake was I got I mean I don't know cuz all the girls like maybe she'll say it seems like maybe she'll stay and do me like a boy was I got Dietz very Charming you're like so exactly and you thought like she wasn't saying that he wasn't worried that he thinks that she was going to stay when Kaelyn was talking to Connor look like she was trying to talk yourself into like that being the right decision she's like so I should stay with you like she did not actually want to do that she goes to Dean Dean just says all the right things he is like I want to work on this he says he wants to be responsible for happiness he notice how happy she was when they were on the beach together he just wants to make her smile he's recognizing some of the problems that he has with pushing people away and he's just got to dive headfirst into try and figure out those problems and and then he just gently pushed a little bit of her hair behind your ear and I was like oh God she's getting a van just get it back by ever so jacked up just leaving I mean what honestly I was so captivated obviously by his beautiful eyes which we know Trent say it swimming pools put on a necklace I want to swim around in that pool in those I knows pool eyes I just this actually made me like Caitlin because first of all she didn't choose to say what kind of just to stay on TV and she just left with Dean and I was like all of it that's kind of cute I like them together Hayley really said it best to she was like I don't really know how to feel like but I'm happy for him so that everybody was so confused obviously cuz it don't know what would happen in the future for them I would like I probably still even didn't give a great speech is got great eyes I think they are still going to have to address this with the original problems that they've always had the reason he left in the beginning was because I can't commit to someone I'm sort of a Wanderer I live in a van that says not going to go away working out on national TV now but I think they can work but at some point and you can set this morning when we were talking about it Dean's going to be in at some point and you got to wonder if Kailyn is the one that can finally settling down that's to be seen but they are going to have to address the issues of him being like I don't like to commit to anything I don't like to commit to a living space I don't like to commit to a romantic partner that stuff that they're going to have to address so Caitlin and Dan both posted together and there was lots of ramen very few showers and a whole lot of Happiness which and then sorry we had to leave Bachelor in Paradise early the fantasy suites waits for no one so my question to you guys's do you think they are really truly living out of this van known only taking showers in in the ocean and snapping and I don't think so maybe Dean but like I follow Kayla Instagram like she's still going and all the like she still travels for work she's at these nice places like she was just at like a bachelorette party that I saw like when people act like she she still does other things like she's not just permanently living out of this van with Dean I do not think I could be wrong on that cuz they have been talking about their their relationship I feel like they take the van out for like trips maybe a few weeks at a time you think maybe they split time like this week we're at Kaylin's apartment and then this week we're in Dean's van I don't know I know I know I love to know the schedule I got to take a listen to talk to them deed is going to be on a tons of podcast coming up it's already lined up I know he's going to be on next podcast Rachel Lindsay was in here she said the teens going on there Hunter podcast she has some sure they're going to explain Dean has his own podcast that Kaylin Corley says Kailyn posted on her story a clip of Dean telling Jared and I think Vanessa Vanessa yes I suck at dating podcast Jared and Dean said that Kailyn and himself they now have their on the same cell phone plan now so they committed to two years of being on the same cell phone place I know that's just kind of thing and try not to takes away like the van aspect to me like a guy who lives in a van does not a podcast hope he does it in the van that would be so what's the name of his podcast I don't think he does this Pie Guys in the van but what's the name is called I suck at dating broadcast I thought that Dean was a guess and then we'd see how to Zone on the I suck at dating podcast with Jared and Vanessa dirty talking about vanity Sweetwater vinaigrette podcast got to change style but that's mean cuz I like all three of them earn our relationship I have no idea she does a follower on Instagram okay so none of them suck at dating right now once married in the two others have a little bit but they're happy Dean loves his van when Dean and Kaylynn gone to that into the car and they were leaving things like hey he was so excited he said the best part about living in a van is your bedroom and the family can take a nap in the van you can eat ramen in the van and he was so excited and so excited about the van I don't want to go to the van like I wanted live in the van not with Dean maybe but I kind of want to check out the van the idea also reposted story from an account called go down wheels and they say it's like I don't know what's it's in a tiny home but this this account got on well as it's this couple and they live in an RV I believe I think they helped like remodel vans in the inside of RVs and whatnot small homes trailer homes and stuff like that so this man like Mike dance on this van might be really nice. You know how much does HGTV shows that are like tiny homes if not all those things like I'm like oh my God I would it makes you want to live in a tiny home yes that's what I envisioned when I don't think of a dirty van when I think of you tell Santa I think of a cool fan I would like to please pictures and seems like they got some nice wood paneling in the back show me like I'm living in a van and now he can get an upgrade and get sponsored I live in these Vans and it's a really nice van that's what I would do loose living in a van beach the beach just have no care in the world are some plant-based drugs yes but only Dean can do these things because it has a million followers on Instagram and has money like you can only do these things you can only go living in a van is only fun when you have money like living in a van when you're also only like socially acceptable if you have money I can buy to start a living the van people would be like that's really weird again that I do do you need to stay over if you could have an apartment if it's not your only option if you had the house that it's like choosing to do that that's crazy but I think it's Charming from Dean because he can have a house if you want to do but my he's not going to live in the wild for Kaelyn to eventually convince him to give up the van life as I think a problem if they're going to run to into at some point if he's going to have to make a final decision like am I done with the van life where do I want to continue vanlife obviously they left together, was very sad but you wouldn't be able to tell from his voice for Connor like he's so are you seeing it now I notice it more cuz you guys have made me notice it more but he isn't like he's so monotone like everything sounds like the same level of emotion so is things going well and it's the same way that he is like I mean like he's just a loser like why was like I can't believe I'm blown away that this is happening right now for him to be like I'm blown away this happened at it right now and not like me like I'm a look mad it's hard to really get the emotion across but he did cry to Blake that was very sad how do you like she didn't even say sorry if it doesn't make any sense to me but like my heart's being pulled to Dean and that you just got up and walked. Was it like there is really no I mean they call each other for a hookup for a baby Connor and Caitlin have it maybe they did never meet before the wedding but now I just thinking that they all know each other anyway. Left for us previously mustachioed man in a van especially when you were so calm play confident about it and seem to actually like the girls so my guess is that Connor is going to be fine okay so let's move on to some of these other couples Katie and Chris they went on a one-on-one date basically Chris just needed to reassure Katie a little bit that he is getting there but Katie was worried that Chris maybe wasn't fully committed or was maybe looking to see if anybody else is going to show up not the case Chris is 100% committed to Katie he's just trying to get to that point where he can give one hundred percent that you they use 100% maybe 30 times in this conversation like it just kept up kept doing it over and over and over again a little emotionally unavailable he is a little bit like he said he's been burned a bunch so he's probably scared nervous the one who burns in the most is the producers with that his name never lie so fast and it just blinks they just put it on really fast and it's done it's so good every time they do it I am I've never seen it actually live I only seen on Twitter right and last night I caught it live and I was like oh my God crush on real I'm very hopefully this works out for Chris because it would just be great like it finally after a bajillion Seasons he actually finds the one from the show from one of these shows that makes them a little boring to watch on the show but I think they are one of the couples that will end up engaged at the definitely okay Matt Donald doesn't really know how to kiss and they're just talked about this and then I think this I don't understand this was maybe my favorite part of the episode Blake just talking about how awkward and uncomfortable mad Donald is around women just like when did you become mr. smooth like I feel uncomfortable when I see Blake talk show she's like the new Playboy of the house and he's just the new Blake but he's just you because you're doing the same things that you were doing I think the only difference is we have a little bit of a back story with Blake where we had that he can and he can do it he has done the hookups you can close a deal we don't think I don't think mad Donald's close any deals what's Matt Donald doesn't like know how to interact with women nobody's talking about his mom like time and time again since traces mom Sydney's trying to give him a massage edible edible arrangements much Sydney like you were going to say she is getting him a massage feels like keep your shorts on take them off I don't really care he's like at some point in your life you need to stop thinking about what your parents are going to think that every moment comes at a different time for everybody but I think that Donald has crossed that line just breathe air try to get him free is Drop Dead Gorgeous gorgeous how do you not know how to kiss I don't get it I don't get it I don't know but it was fun to hear a Chase talk about it just being like why are you in a bad Saint Patrick's free kiss him and then not Donald immediately started talking about Sydney to Bri I don't know he's just not smooth not smooth not at all now all right and then revien shows up she was sent home on the first sign of colon season by Donald cannot say her name for the life of them says seems like it sounded right when he kept saying it but revien she goes by rev she takes Connor on a Segway date pretty uneventful the kissed Connor does Connor still seem pretty sad like just going around on Segways oh well that's not going to be a real thing that's really again this felt like one of those times where I just didn't need first nights at home person coming down those stairs if Connor it's why they use her like there at the end of the show literally tonight is when people are up I guess starting to propose I don't know so this girl is coming in like this day before probably people are like the show ends so they're like it's just she's just like a filler filler space. More serious between Demi and Christian Demi is not about the PDA Christian is more about the PDA Demi kind of thought she's been flirting with all the other girls being more touchy-feely because she thought that she wasn't giving kind of enough but they got a Day card they were able to talk it all through and it was great but also really sad like and it once again we talked about it so much but it's so great to see this on the show descriptions a Glock I understand where you're coming from I went through all these feelings of being out and thinking about what other people are going to think she's looking at the fair thing is just going through it now National everybody's watching her but this is why I love Demi because she's just so real and I and I truly feel like I'm watching you sometimes you watch some of the people in the show and you just don't feel like it's totally one-hundred-percent themselves right Demi you feel like you're just getting literally all of her her real emotion just really makes you feel like you're a part of it and that's why I love them it yeah because she could have just been like Demi and Christian were great the whole time we run the show everything we're glad we finally I had her come on the show we're going to get engaged or what's it whatever goes on and then but she's like she's showing like a real side of it being a guy I am uncomfortable to have these feelings I have this anxiety and it makes it was by far the most interesting part of last night's episode working through her feelings about what's been going on I love Christian Christian she decided she really reassured Demi that she is there for demi she will wait she's happy where they are right now and she has no problem with Demi working through these feelings and she's not going anywhere and Christian I just want to tell Christian on my problem so she's got a voice that I just want Christian to tell me everything's going to be alright and Christian is obviously very new to all of this so yeah she's going to like try to make friends with everybody there and try to fit in so I think when she was talking about the whole touching thing it's just like I could see where Danny was coming from without how I would react I would get annoyed too but it was also like you know she's trying to fit in here she's trying to make friends and I think that she's fit in well so far away I'm a lot but no it is strange that there's just this is just a person off the street like a person not above the bachelor Universe they brought her in Demi's they're together now and it's just the kind of forget that he's just not that she wasn't part of the driveway and then we had John Paul Jones plan a for Tisha because she never went to her own High School prom I tweeted like that cuz this is how I imagine things go down right but I guess it's like ice wishful thinking that maybe John Paul Jones one of The Producers said can we make this happen they were probably like hell yeah let's do it but I tweeted that and Derek replied to my tweet was like I think you got the other word for helped wishful thinking on my part but I really like Stacia it was very adorable they got all dressed up there the whole prom set up everybody's dancing it was great I just I just don't think Chase is going to get there with him I just don't I think she can't get no and I think she's trying to nightmare I think she's trying to convince herself like he's so nice he really likes me like let me try and do this but we saw Teisha episodes back really not enjoy being like I don't really think like this is going to work with me and John Paul Jones so when you have those initial feelings it's kind of hard to just Dive Right into a relationship you're still going to have this feeling I don't know why it seems like it seems like she's trying to I think put on a happy face maybe just ride it out there's just an engagement that like that makes me cringe thinking about John Paul Jones in case you get so I think this is going to end after this whole shows up that's not going anywhere last night was cute is adorable I liked all the all the couples dancing at the night shift from that's cool but I don't see you I don't think you're going anywhere he decided that he wanted to make his own 101 is owned a card for Christina wanted to show her that he's fully ready to commit and be there for and it just absolute backfire in his face Christina Christina dumped him left to be she she just said she could not get to where she needed to be in that relationship so she left and then Blake left and yeah that's the end of paradise or Blake he kissed her shoulder so many times has kept kissing her shoulder it was pumped up about yeah Christine is the one I'm going to marry her we're going to have kids together it's going to be great we're going to ride off into the sunset and Christina ain't she barely looked him in the eye every time we saw it was really really he was just like I feel bad I feel fake about this and I was so confused which I respect Christina for that she was like look I came into this thinking that I was going to be your friend and I wanted you to find love like I did not really expect you to spend this on me I'm not I'm not prepared for this so I'm going to leave can we have a show or nobody can just leave them you think I should like you got you have to get voted off I think they're home but it's just like every was just when you get out on their own voted off your on this island you got to go over there for a long time we really watch them go through a lot of stupid shit right so I think maybe a time when they have to be there if it's everybody had to stay until there was Rose ceremonies they just would not have as much drama like they wouldn't have liked true but it's like Dean leaving and Connor coming in like they wouldn't we would have just been stuck would like the same conversation between Dean and Kailyn from Mary Sarah Point friend Night 2 Dylan and Hannah bless their hearts they just missed everything that happened that one just miss it all. What's going on in Paradise animals like Blake and Kristina left they just they just had no idea didn't respond to my tweet that he was like I woke up everybody was gone I think she's just I mean this is the way to do Paradise if you can figure it out early enough and Hannah just figured it out there like we like each other let's just hang out the whole time will be in the pool be on the beach about what else is going on they completely missed two of the main characters of the Season show leaving that leave imma said Island Again leaving the beach and everybody is having those conversations on if they see their relationships being real if they don't so Demi and Christian were have are having a ton of very like real life conversations there their Converse Visions like are the most normal which like they have real life couple conversations when they were sitting on the bed and Christian was trying to explain herself but she was totally like looking in the other direction looking at all ever because when you have sometimes you have those tough conversations you like can't let the person the right so they they're having very real life conversations John Paul Jones and Tisha or trying to this made me laugh of John Paul Jones does not understand my teacher wants to have nice things she was like I just want them like I want nice clothes that's very much would not understand denim like a denim Speedo I'll be exactly Dylan and Hannah get their dick hard they go to a random Mexican child's birthday party Dylan Hannah that you're not going to end up getting a lot of air time does they've been away for so long let's just send them to a stage birthday party to send them to a birthday party and we'll have but Dylan pick up the small child and sort of prove to handle that hey I can be a father so obviously he has to play with the kids every everybody knows that a guy that's good with kids just every girl Dylan this is Dylan's friend and they know I'm this is why they're at this birthday party they gave no background to it was just I was just random we're going to go to this random kid's birthday party and mingle with everyone who is going to be there a truly made no sense because there were parts were there making out and you could still hear the kids voices in the background now I don't know if that's just like editing by The Producers or what it is but I thought it was kind of weird as well but they were so cute that I forgot about how we are totally right like they are so cute that I was not really concentrating on the day park however it does make me think that ABC and like the producers and everything they just like hire people to be extra for these dates there's no way they just found out about some kids birthday parties are like let's send let's send them on a date like something was probably just like all right let's send them to a birthday party let's let's do this let's cast this birthday party that's even weirder who was like oh well you know if you're someone tells kid acting insane a party you're so right I got two birthday parties on my face when I was turning 5 years old because we had two stage one for Bachelor in Paradise Farm or without them if they just going to an actual birthday party I just can't imagine that they just stumbled across a random birthday party and they were like the better we should have their date like there's no way the whole thing was definitely plan question number two for Dylan when he comes in her first ask about how much sex they're having in Mexico and to was that a real kid's birthday party I just felt very uncomfortable Dylan and Hannah are so cute they're so in love they both said that they are in love with each other it was I mean Dylan I just want to squeeze little cheeks like one had a phone just so cute when they really are I know what he profess his love for Hannah and then Panic kind of June hesitate but just took a moment and then was like I love you to Dylan and his face lit up like a Christmas tree like he was just smiling so hard like he's so happy as great as everyone knows Dillon's reason for coming up there is like I want to meet Hannah I want to have a relationship with her and usually that does not work out. Usually it's sort of crashes and burns for whatever reason this one it's the fairytale that it's a paradise Fairy Tail and they are going to be together it's great let's not let's try and get away with not being on the right side of History here though like I'm so true that we were going to bring it on not going to lie I forgot and I were very much and didn't think it was going to happen I was going to kiss other boys kissing other boys like all the time she was kissing other boys and then she would bring poor poor Della Drive I'm always team Dylan I'm just looking out for his feelings were Hannah would bring him to one of the Cabanas being like hey I kiss this other guy just giving you a heads up and it's like how many times is this going to happen once I realized Hannah was all in on Dylan I feel much better about it but early on I really thought Hannah was going to break Dylan's poor heart it didn't end up happening I'm glad that happened in there going to hopefully stay off in the sunset together I had my doubts early on but those doubts and I'm happy to be wrong that's exactly what yet at the top of his lungs may I Moana so just screaming. His name is Hannah and and they were all like what and explain what he did till I call the guys back on the beach and was like they all must have thought I was such a dumbass yeah probably most likely and it's also strange that you were just two random adults at a party that weren't probably invited that is name is Hannah when that's just totally not what he wanted to say all right so then we go to Connor who obviously is a fresh off Kaelyn leaving him he can't stop thinking about Whitney they talked at the wedding he's really hoping that Whitney shows up and then we then we got truly another phenomenally stage of staged event because I also cannot believe that this is happened naturally clearly this was all planned as well card leaves does he like what movies are coming I'm going home so he leaves right at the same time that Whitney is showing up and tastes like oh my God he literally left like 25 minutes ago they actually showed their trucks like passing each other like Connor leaving and Whitney showing up I'm totally convinced that nobody was in those cars that was all like all right let's make let's show these cars passing each other like there's no way they actually passed each other but there was part of me that if there were people in there I thought they were going to make them get into some sort of car accident head-on collision the ABC producers had been like all right we're going to make it look like they're leaving but they're actually going to get into an auto accident I would like I would have I would have just been like I'm only watching that repairs I will never watch any other show I won't watch any dramas I won't watch HBO I will only watch Bachelor in Paradise because I am totally okay with them going completely like we're just staging car accident I'm all in on that one with swerve and then it would send the other one which is ridiculous that our thoughts went there first Anything could happen on the show it's literally anything happened I was Chuck Connors got to save Whitney from experience in bumper cars and they just showed that Annalise right on the Shelf yeah so Whitney shockingly shows up at Connors Hotel I mean if that room is where they keep the paradise contestants before they fly back to wherever they live sign me up at hotel room was beautiful I would refuse to leave that hotel room in the nice room to make it seem like those are his digs so Whitney shows up there so happy to see each other Connors just like shirtless and sweaty and for what reason I don't know for sure but if I was Connor I would always be shirtless and sweatshirts walk around this is a business meeting like sweaty and shirtless you should be sweaty and shirtless about that he does have the I just I just got off the treadmill look all the time Ann and it's because so I was watching with my roommate who she watches like what I watch am ever so she kind of keeps up and she's like damn that guy looks like a swimmer and I was like you are very correct e was a college swimmer so we'd also does going to have that permanently just got out of the pool look like that's a great look they were so happy to see each other they're making out whilst I mean I don't know if anything happened for them after this but they were very happy to see each other and they are probably one of like the hottest parents ever be so hot, hot like they're that picture that I don't know if you tweeted it are baby chicks in the office with it they didn't bring them into Paradise maybe it's because it's near the end all right now maybe in car when he made it there a thing we don't really know it felt like an opening open-ended book or something put up a video on chicks in the office that was Connor like shaking his leg stuff and he looks like nervous and so many people were commenting I like oh he has half a chub half a chub I mean it's a funny visual it's just a funny version maybe not incorrect she's looking at me like she's about to die from utilities just got disrespectful that's how you know it's making me look like such a weenie even kissing Whitney she was just standing there and say he's getting a hard-on just from Whitney standing next to him that's if a girl like Whitney shows up to your hotel room when you think that she's not going to and you look like you just got done doing some sort of physical activity something's going on I think he is he may have had half a chub guy and where to take his word from it moving on I'm moving on so happy playing to call client to call got a Day card Nicole said you know Noelle bombs have been dropped yet there they have not reached that point I also laughed at them all like just drooling over clay walking up and he was against is my typical Chicago look at you was in jeans and a t-shirt like what you look like play we've been seeing play for 6 weeks and Trent I can't like your your clay voice is all I hear when I listen to Clay now so like they're on the state they're working out the logistics of possibly having a long-distance relationship you can tell clay his kind of holding back a little bit but in the cold kind of was like our basic awesome like are you falling for me at all at giving a little bit and he kind of talked around it at first and Nicole's face like I could see shared a freak out and I think clay was like oh shit just freaking out and he was like yeah I am definitely falling for this is the couple that I was ready for heartbreak I was fully loaded, how do you say I was waiting the whole episode I still think it's, I think you're right because clay seems very non-committal Nicole seems very like you got to make this happen or I'm going to lose my shitt I think it's really only a matter of time before they do I thought it was going to happen last night but class order relented during date but it's very it's very chopped keto so Teisha could draw him like a French girl from the Titanic the flute music was playing in the back it was a funny moment slightly uncomfortable I like that they had to use knock-off oh yeah we can't go to Celine Dion olympe 10 million dollar bills tailgate play flute music Hill's KD is like seems to be getting very frustrated and then we had the rose ceremony Chris Harrison said there was no cocktail party everybody just had to jump right in and smack Donald had this quote which had people going crazy on Twitter me included it really brought up the you know men are trash ideas he said Sydney Sydney embroidery who is Sydney I can connect on a deeper level and talk to her about anything and Breeze like the supermarket so obviously tough luck because he does pick 3 but I had one person to be back at me like that she thinks the audio was added together and I listened back and I listen multiple times and I can kind of hear it like it sounds like there's a little bit of a change before he says the supermodel he probably said like I'm Breeze like blah blah blah blah blah I think they cut out everything else and just put embry's a supermodel because that's like as a show as episode continued that was the narrative like Matt's I don't can't shut up about her being a supermodel and that's like why you know I'm saying so I'm like that's very interesting when I listen to what I cooked I felt like I kind of heard a difference do you guys think that this is something they do often does okay you guys start immediately shaking head yes so I honestly hand up was under the impression that they can't really edit your words to just create something that you didn't say it all yeah I thought maybe they'd like you know you're talking for a while and then they just like cut on middlebranch out or whatever I was not under the impression that they are literally just like taking words and placing it in place of other things you know what I mean like he's literally just took him saying super and model at some point and made it's a supermodel that's crazy right at engine knows if it's true but did any did say supermodel my guess would be he said other things about Bree and that wasn't that she's just a supermodel but they cut those things out and just put it that she's a supermodel cuz they asked if you watch the clip like they show Matt Donald talking but in the part that he says and she's like a supermodel the video was Abri so it wasn't of him so you couldn't actually see the words come out of his mouth that way and I think I think I do this all the time I think they go full North Korea they control everything they wanted to put it back together so so I think that's I think that's what happened there but let's go back to the Rose ceremony because oh boy Lux Stone goes first he has his little speech ready he wants to give his Rose to bri-bri walks up and she says I cannot accept this Rose from you can we play the audio because it's so good every time he's not know is I pay attention Trent tweeted it out it's play the audio of Luke Stone giving his Rose debris and she saying no did Luke and Bree have any sort of interaction before this night Carolina. That's why I was so you can see if you watch the video back you can see it as soon as he says breathe a cut to her and she sort of looks to the side like why am I the one that just got called up here right now major cuz she's like as she is. Like I feel like she's so hot that's it I think that I don't want to use the rest this time to get to know you better accept this Rose play I came here to find love and a relationship and I just don't think that I see that with you and knowing what this Rose represents I I can't say ask them sorry well this is never happened before so return on the rose is there anyone else who would like Luke's Rose tonight anyone hi unfortunately if you're not in a relationship absolutely girls don't worry about sacrifice turn down he does the Harrison cuz he then says well it's never happened before it has never happened before 10 just the way his delivery it just everything about Chris Harrison in the way that he delivers these lines basically everybody to take the Rose from Luke with unbelievable anybody like Lux Rose and then he goes anyone it's literally soul-crushing also it's also good because when he says this is never happened for you standing like five feet away from Luke that's cool. How long did it feel like it took for Chris Harrison walk over you too cuz it had to feel like 10 years words like he's walking over does anybody want this Rose and then nobody says anything anyone High time for sad music in the back is so good to sacrifice what is this music remind you of oh I am at a nice party on a boat somewhere like some sad cartoon it makes me think I've never mind anyone makes me think I'm just some sad Pixar movie clip Charlie Brown and sounds like a butcher sadder now it's time to say goodbye is Luke because nobody wants to Rose he does he tries to hug jpj and images are just a really tough moment maybe maybe time we was amazing so obviously the rose ceremony ends we said goodbye to three girls Sydney Raven Healey when he also want to say Haley just like I don't necessarily like lukestone but before the rose ceremony when Haley was like he's not my type but he's like a good conversationalist but he's like the poor man's neck hey like I know Nick viall and he is way hotter than him I was like oh shit just I mean really like that's okay with him. Maybe we we were talking about the comparison between the two last week but Haley come on you're standing right near the guy she put it like it's a lot of whys I knew that it was like a mean amount of wives is it really was was looking at Dean and Kailyn and in front of Connor Connor take that in so okay then we go to the next morning shout-out to Chase he was actually swimming in the ocean I feel like that was maybe the only time we seen somebody swim but that's the water was not rough so people can swim then Chris Harrison shows up he looks great you makes a joke that he's a little overdressed be looks fantastic he said that was the last Rose ceremony Paradise is basically over but now I have to decide if you and your partner want to go into Fantasy Suites if you don't like. C on you're going home Matt's Auto can't shut up about how he knows he made the right decision he goes to talk to Bri brings up the supermodel thing again and Brie's like I think you made the wrong decision you only see my exterior like this isn't going to work and I be dating a supermodel that not Donald any more yet what did you see his face when he was like to be leaving here with a supermodel girlfriend I tell you you don't leave for the supermodel's on time as always and nobody talks about their mom is often is Matt Donald is dating a supermodel a lot yeah so nobody wants to be on Paradise and that was the end of Jason Angela also had a 2-second conversation where they were like it's not really here this is fun let's leave so they're gone. It was really fast so she made me forget that about all the other couples that were there yeah that we haven't been seen it but Angela I forgot about her that was supposed to be supposed to be like oh my gosh clay Angela Nicole the most that's going to go crazy and then it was just more like it's expected way more drama out of them and Angela's like super super chill go home Dylan and Hannah agreed to go to the fantasy suites clay and Nicole agreed to go to the fantasy suites and then we had to take a break up with John Paul Jones which was the relationship has come to an end denotation basically I we saw this I just feel that we all saw this coming Tatian knew that this was going to end what are you planning at me and she was at the club if you want oh not really okay to be completely honest you don't want no problem I'll just said he's in love with her and she was like okay I'm not there I was basically a clip I agree that we saw this coming and they were to break up with them during last night's episode of when they were doing the Titanic think I almost thought they had me for a second I was like mentation maybe she really does like John Paul Jones that this will work I think she wanted to do like more fun things maybe she thought she could get there remembered to have him like look you in the eyes and be like I am in love with you tayshia Adams I think that's when you're like oh shit we're just like this is it like that because they seem so sweet and quirky and then the Derek's of happened Paradise relationship I still think at that time like I don't know I just did maybe it's just cuz even though John Paul Jones I said so many times how he is ready to be engaged I'm like I don't know it's like when you go on vacation and you hook up with somebody so yeah I know. Not actually but people always talk about you know you go on vacation and vacation hookups are just different than regular hook up aren't you at summer camp I used to go to a show at the camp Wapsie I used to go every summer and you meet a girl you just hang out for like a week and like oh man this is great to have your first kiss that's right but I had jpj and Tasha are a summer camp relationship no doubt about it and then when jbj looks are in the eyes and says I'm ready I'm in love let's do this tastes like no I can't do it do it really I don't really blame Tatian the situation I just got this was a very you don't like we are all saying it's just that Summer Fling it's not really a real thing they're having fun together they laugh together but that doesn't always seen as more feel that doesn't always mean that you guys should get engaged when you're having fun together right so you know they that's that's the end of Jungle Jim's is like all right good-bye Teisha and you get he got up and left when they got a hell of a montage was this before or after after after so then picked her up and carried her like 5ft which was very bizarre I couldn't tell where this was going I was like is able to get back yeah I was like I'm sorry and he picks her up and they're looking to leave together like I but you just pick her up and then put her back to you is Dylan and Hannah hadn't crashed a young child's birthday party earlier in the episode that would have been by far the weirdest part where you just pick her up and put her down cuz like I don't understand what that mean oh no I was it I don't know I don't know and is really hot people say she ran all the way and then he carried her five feet is very confusing to me that's all are but you know that that was an invitation John Paul Jones to get into the car John Paul Jones couldn't even get a shirt before he got on his journey but he had that he had that Polaroid to hold on to the prom picture and and I was at but no shirt is that just for show because I got to get their stuff I think they have to pack their bags everyday yeah I think that's what I like that's some type of ruler before every arrow ceremony or something the bags packed packed just in case you're leaving like Chris Harrison when they were like are at this now you have to decide if you want to stay for Fantasy Suites everybody go pack your bags first that's actually good explanation your bags cuz you never know it could also film am driving away and then make them cope after getting a negative I could also see that as well. Elevate that Connor was his and that be tough if they see each other the airport jpj Teisha like a boy Crystal and Goose his wedding so just showing up on Paradise like they all probably kept these people in a hotel room until they were it was their time to go to the beach do you think this is like when we were going to go on The Amazing Race and they said to us even who got kicked off the show you need to go stay at this private island where the fuck it is it's kind of the same thing in Paradise if you believe you are staying in this hotel so that's all they might not like they might have to stay in in those like holding hotel rooms basically we got that very sad station John Paul Jones Montage of all their Great Moments and then we also saw Christian and Demi continuing to discuss their relationship like we said there's really not much more to say about Christian and Demi besides like they just keep having very realistic couple conversations and they keep making steps in the right direction and they keep talking about their feelings and actually having explanations and it's like there's no it's not there's nothing really to make fun officer's you're right. You're the realest relationship were watching her getting really intimate details were seeing what they're thinking we're not really seeing like the insecurities that other couples have so I think I Deming Christian are doing a really good job on the show just like bringing light to it on TV first of all I was there still like each other are we going to want to leave here together engaged Krishna Demi they like each other they had a relationship before the show and they got on the show Christian join them they obviously like each other so now they're doing the actual work relationship like the problem is that they are for seeing for them in the real world it's not like like you said that like Chris and Katie we saw them next they're still battling because Chris just keep saying that he feel so unsure and that he pushes people away he doesn't know I really thought we were about to get like a Kevin and Astrid moment where he was like going to be like I can't do this I got my ready to be engaged just leave and obviously it worked out just fine for Kevin and Astrid but I think Katie reassured him well enough and they agreed to go to the fantasy suite I was so sure that they were breaking up that I tweeted I tweet about I was like damn I can't believe this is ending and then somehow Katie pulled it back in and Chris Chris Bukowski seems like he seems confused but he does like Katie so I guess I'll just like her but he is very very cuz he is about like the future and what this is all so I think more realistic I think he's so confused cuz he's worried about them in you know the real world was right there and when they're having a conversation and you can see on Katie's face she starts crying immediately because everybody's been in that position before were you know when the person you're dating or talking to is about to tell you that they don't want to talk to you anymore or do you anymore and you just know it if they don't have to say anything it's the way they start the engines are in the eye and Trent you tweeted like this is really awkward that they're breaking up you while it didn't happen but it seem like that's where he's gone whenever someone says like I always just push away the people I shouldn't it's like a boy so yeah so now it's 100% And so it there okay for now like I said we saw the preview for the finale next week 3 hours and I think I don't know I'm so confused I don't know how many couples are actually going to get engaged Christian I think Jodi and Chris I don't know for sure I see this I see the Rings and that's why I'm like I don't know what's going on but I also don't I don't know I kind of one clip of Hannah being like I'm so in love with you but they're trying to trick us that I know their sign girls are trying to trick us I know it but I'm also a my heart and like they're so young they don't need to get engaged yet but they are so in love so I understand why they would do it on the show I think we go to 44 I think to look for a Christian Nicole and Clay they might those two might they might break up my break up right on the spot right there yeah I'm I'm not confident to call him clay I'm not coming soon Kristian Katie hearing I don't know for some reason I don't know I feel like Chris is going to figure it out until Christmas will Aleve together he shows her how committed he is by proposing like that says I know you're being like I like I know I've been so annoying and I don't know what I want but like here's this ring let's be engaged for like 4 years and then decide if you want to get married I could see that I just that one clip of Nicole being like do you love me I was like oh God is it I don't think this is going to end well now you're asking somebody if they love you while you're there supposed to be engaging yeah proposing you're probably not getting engaged like a solid rule of thumb we saw the preview for the live show which just I'm not the live show up cuz it's already happened but whatever reunions show I guess going to be fantastic I can't wait the only thing that I really don't care about is the Jordan Christian situation I did use that as one of the men like really don't care watches I really hope that they don't have a lot of your time, I'm in for like if if people are screaming at each other on the stage I'm probably going to be into it no matter who is Blake on the hot seat is going to be something it's going to be something and I also just remind me to say it I'm going to keep my thoughts to myself like I don't want to say I feel bad for this guy so I'm going to say and we'll see what happens now I could I could see that I feel the same way but we'll see what happens because we saw the clip of Kaelyn she's crying you could tell that it was like Dean's arms on on her shoulders like ghetto comforting her Blake I don't know it's tough but you just tell it like I didn't think it was going to go that people going to go that way like to know that's all about posting the stories I would I would guess the text messages so it's going to be very very interesting John Paul Jones is getting down on a knee with Teisha for what I don't know I felt like a smokescreen totally dead babies and I like ask her on a date or something and we're also going to meet the new Bachelor Chris and strange update your wardrobe with the new season can be so expensive

Verdun usually Sky people so this is exciting for us is it weird it is Theon my podcast I only do Skype interviews cuz I don't want any I don't want to actually have to like hang out with people in my home you know cuz no one wants anyone coming over nowadays so if you can stay far away from me and then just type in even better if we were doing this I also probably would not want people coming to my apartment yeah but then like I used to work in a actual like real radio studio and like people coming to the studio for interviews is the worst sin like to come in yet look at you a water you know about the asshole people they bring in your like I don't know why you're here but can I help you out comes anywhere our producer before the sea was like actually this is kind of great that we just Skype him cuz you know he's not actually going to come in here and we have to go through the whole process of like saying hello and I yeah and like I have my own home studio so this sounds good like no one's going to know that I'm not there right now so this is this is the best thing that could ever happen so that that is awesome but Wells we're very excited to have you here and we want to talk about many things but first of all we want to say that you are kind of like the podcast Prince I would say maybe podcasting Prince you do two separate podcast yeah I do it's it's probably too much to be honest but yeah like the one that I do with Brandi Cyrus who's like Miley's older sister and Billy Ray's daughter we've been doing that for years is called your favorite thing podcast in like we both lived in Nashville for a while and our lives and we were we were in the same group of friends and and I guess we started doing that podcast like before podcast for a thing and that one's just really fun to do in and kind of like idiotic like I said most podcast I like they're always like the dumbest promises but people I don't know are stuck in traffic so often that they've been a popular yet so I really love you and that will be fun and Brandy just a cool chick and like her her perceptive perception on life is so much different than everyone else's because like not only is her sister like a Megastar what her father is also like a Megastar as well so like what then she's just like a normal chick but then she has like weird stories of Life yeah so I got on the Jets and we flew to Madison Square Garden and like you're here. Right thanks for not inviting me but okay yeah it's it's like she's normal when she drops in the private chat lines exactly what did you go over there cuz they Tish and Billy Ray like live really close to where I live in in Los Angeles and then we'll go over there in like hang out at their house which is totally normal and then like smoking so much weed you like we're what world am I in right now is like my dream is just smoke with Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus but less if you come to La I can set it up man cuz like always happening and they are the two dopest fucking people in the world I love them so much really seem like it and then you also do the podcast with Stephanie Pratt Pratt cast has that gotten you involved in the Hills drama it has an idea and I wish it hadn't was like it's so dumb I just called with Stephanie like I have decided that podcast come to be so I still work for I heart and I heart wanted to put together a show that was a companion for the hills when it came back like iHeart does a lot of the bachelor companion podcasts right and so I thought was well the hills is is coming back with a huge we need to have like a Companion podcast and answers staff was pick kind of to do that show and it's like a wonderful and a smart-ass stuff is like she's never done any broadcasting whatsoever you know so I think they were like we need to bring someone in who has done this before who can kind of keep the trains of the Train on the tracks and understands like like radio 101 and so they were like well wells will be perfect for this also like there's a little bit of there's a little bit of instability with everyone on the Hills right and like my job in in Paradise right as I'm at the therapist bartender and I'm like the guy that gives everyone kind of good advice and I think the thought was we're going to need a lot of good advice for a lot of these people on it is it is it crazy now to kind of see like the to podcast connect almost like now everybody is intertwined together it's like Stephanie to Brody to Kayla to Miley to Brandi and then you're just in you're just in the mix of it all just talking one episode on your favorite thing where it's called like like my podcast Worlds Collide cuz I knew like Caitlin co-hosted my my your favorite thing podcast when I was like out of town so like I've known Caitlin now for a while and we'd a podcast where they were like in Italy and I was like what are you guys doing Alias me and Miley and and Caitlin Rawls hanging out and let Lake Como or whatever and then like a couple days later the news breaks them like what I wanted to tell me what the hell is going on yeah I really would have helped her number see how selfish Brando funny protecting the family like that are you kidding me that's amazing so we also obviously you just got engaged yep we're very excited we are excited absolutely love you and Sarah we actually love Sarah for those who are listening who might not know how did you and Sarah meet so she's a big Bachelor fan and she would like live tweet the show a lot and when I was on when I was on JoJo's season we were doing like a men tell all and I like made to reference has one was like they were two literary reference one I said we were we were Piggy and Chad like like Lord of the Flies and then I said like I'm going to call him Baltimore and I called him like he who shall not be named or something like that and so I may like to literary references and I think that she was just surprised that anyone from The Bachelor world could read cuz he tweeted that the 8th grade so I think I tweeted back to her and on something snarky DMV or whatever but that was not a thing and then then a couple years went by and I became like the bartender on the show and she tweeted out like oh my God Wells is the bartender now in Paradise like this is the greatest thing ever and then I was like okay so then I really I responded again like something snarky and then I really like went in went in like hard in the paint on the DMS after that I don't know I'm the one that would like one that like she remembers really vividly is me asking her out and it was something to the effect that pay next time I'm in La let's go out and get tacos and beer and I feel like I was a pretty safe play like I really like tacos and beer and so she was like yeah absolutes do it and then and then I fly to Los Angeles and actually the first the first date of ever went to if there was is kind of insane so do you want to hear the story or I made out of some kidney transplant so there was a moment where she she texted me or called me and was like Hey listen you got to come by next Monday or like this is going to happen like this date is going to happen for for like a very long time and I'm very much like that guy who always says like Universal workout for me. Don't worry don't work don't worry and I had no idea that she had this like this upcoming surgery so like a day later I got called by a suit do a lot of work with an after Humane Association and you like getting dogs adopted and so I got a I got a hit up by by this was a national hero dog Awards effectively in so they give out the awards to dogs have done amazing things a lot of times like dogs in like the military and like dogs who helped in like Lake police dogs look like that and you know that you were like a lot with dogs we'd love it if you came and presented it's this weekend I was like a perfect so I called her up and I was like hey by the way the universe worked out for the hero dog Awards this weekend so we will go out and I didn't know this would like later on she was like oh my God he like got his people to like get in this gig so he could black people people people in the same weekend as the Emmy and there's this party called the night before the Emmys party which I didn't really know what that was so I do my presenting at the hero dog Awards I finished I text her hey I'm ready to go get a drink and she's like he listen everything in Beverly Hills right now is closed I'm at this party I'm a plus one just come over and we'll get a drink here and I was like yeah sure whatever I have no idea what this was the go over to this party the night before the Emmys party is every fucking famous television like no joke like the stranger things kids were there and like everyone from Game of Thrones and like the guy from the first person that walks up to me is like Johnny Galecki from Big Bang Theory oh my God where am I right now so our first date was the most trial by fire thing in the world where I'm just like oh my God everyone so famous why they call me the direction of Sarah Hyland that's like so good-looking episode of Entourage like Johnny Galecki coming up right came up my clock made fun of me a little bit like you know if you have to admit that he didn't say this very nice but it's very much like what are you doing here why are you here that's unreal and we're very much like reality TV people are very much a novelty to I think like actual TV people you know so you mix a lot of people are fans of Bachelor and Bachelor in Paradise and so they're like bartender here that's amazing what did you wear was I was I was presenting at that thinks I was wearing a suit so I don't have it and I guess I was like she just threw me to the wolves and I was able to survive and now here we are and we were that you really paved the way for Tyler see here yeah I walked so they could run right likes without without you would I don't know I don't know who knows yeah I don't know if that one's true or not but I sure hope so cuz I would it would be so awesome and so I ask another question for about your proposal did Sarah have any idea this was coming or was she totally surprised she thought it was coming and then like at the last minute I threw a curveball in that made her think I've done the thing that a lot of girls do that like I've built all this up in my head and that's not actually happening we were we were in the islands and and I had planned like this like picnic on the SEC tiny little island like that was not on the one that we are staying at and so she got all dressed up and like their makeup and everything and I was like I really like we're going on a picnic like it's okay that you don't need to be all like breast the nines and and then I put on like literally like like a swim trunks and a T-shirt and I like this look and she was like oh you're you're not wearing like a button down and I was like should I and she goes I don't know if she does I can act to send their love that but yeah so then I think she I think she thought it was if it wasn't going to be happening there I think then she probably would have been very confused just cuz we were like a really nice and we've been playing this one for a while so I think she says she wants to believe that she didn't know I was coming but I think she did she had that feeling my woman have those kinds of instinct except sometimes it's wrong with my sister went through three stages where she got her nails done wore a really nice outfit and then thought she was going to propose to and didn't it happen every time it didn't happen and then when it finally did happen she had no idea no idea a lot of guys listen to this podcast has so much when you do this one piece of advice I would give to like every guy out there who's going to get engaged until like they're most tell they're like that the friends that you trust the most that that's going to happen so they can tell the girl to get a pedicure cuz I didn't realize that's a big deal but it makes sense cuz afterwards you get so many pictures of your hands but if you got like a wack-ass you know nail situation going on and then your girlfriend but yeah it's okay I want to take that advice definitely definitely I'm okay we have some bartending questions because we are very curious about how your role in Paradise works and and how I don't know I guess kind of involved you are like are you just behind the bar constantly yell at you have a room what's the situation where are you living yes I don't live on site I live like down the hill to settle in this dope little town called Sayulita which like there's a part of me doesn't want to tell people about it because it's like this Hidden Gem but it is like one of the kids like this like real like Mediterranean Bohemian Chic surftown that's a very safe and just cool and so I stay in like a little Villa there and it's like a 7-minute drive to the property where we film so the other send like a car for me when they when they need me to get behind the bar generally how it works is if there's two ships really there's but I couldn't do it until I couldn't do an entire day I would just like run out of gas so you know the night before or the day before whatever it is that be like okay we're thinking a day session free tomorrow so we'll have the car pick you up at like 11 and then I'll work it from like noon to 8 p.m. or it'll be like hey tomorrow to Rose ceremony so we need to later so get here around 8:30 and then we'll wrap you at like 4:30 in the morning whatever so so there's always other bartenders who are working when I'm not there but there can only be one bar open because you got to watch how much people are drinking cuz you just don't want people to do stupid things and get over-served so monitor how much every cuz we know there is drinking there's rules is that your job to monitor that yes yeah it's a little it's a little scary do you ever break the rules for people like the ones you like no because that they may be watching me the entire time and they'll even come down and be like hey so-and-so is needs to pump the brakes or sometimes I'll be like a pump the brakes and if I'm really friends with them I'll probably say like Hey listen you're getting a little loose look let's just slow it down and if I'm not for the Demorest make them like really shity drinks water down very smart what's the actual limit the two drinks an hour can get pretty turned on by the way if I have been 50 sure lock works but you can't have you have a shot if you get up to drink at the same time so like you can have a shot and then like a beer or shot in a wine or a shot and mixed drink you can have two shots and you got to finish one before you have the next and what but it just for the hour so like I always say that if you want to get drunk you can just figure out like what time it is so it's a it's a place at 1:55 okay have your shot at 1:55 and then once to hits then you can have on a shot and then you can have a drink so effectively could have three drinks for 25 minutes but it takes a long time for people to like catch on to that they don't really have to ask me if so do you have your phone yes why we both have the same reaction you're like the only one right all-powerful behind the scenes photos that you post like you have to pee so that's why I was like how I wonder if he takes himself like if he has his own phone or if he has to use somebody else's phone but that's nice that's ya Ali like in the mix so I guess that makes sense yeah yeah I'd also like logistically I would have to have my phone because I'm not living on set and that's as beautiful as Mexico is and as safe as a soul town is like it's something bad happens I need to be able to hit someone up and be like hey stranger days are help me right now and I need something there's no producers around or like I'm tired I need to leave or something I have to text somebody be like hey let me get out of here you know we'll get your thoughts on Paradise right now I don't want to ask cuz you know everything you were there out of the people the new cast members that you've seen around who's like your favorite absolute favorite person wealth of Derek and I were on the same season of The Bachelorette together and then we were actually roommates on the show like when we started traveling around the world so I season my favorite but he's one of my best friends just in general he's like a New York so I can Finance you know like a lot of a personal trainer friends switch there's a lot of those around in the NFL really understand like those people getting close so Derek and I've always been chill and I thought like honestly like he's so like emotionally woke that I don't know if anyone would have been able to do what he did from the backflow world this season as well as he did it like I mean he was like his feelings are hurt he was bummed out but it's also smart to be like wow okay this is a big deal and I need to like you know I need I need I need to be really sensitive about this which I really appreciated I would like it's funny like I didn't like Demi at first I thought you'd be annoying to me like someone who thinks that they're funnier than they really are person you know but then when I got to know where in Paradise I really started to appreciate her and she is funny but like I think what I appreciated more was a her courage than her chops I guess yeah I feel like I feel like that's how a lot of people felt with them especially from Colton season because I remember when I first saw her on Colton season I was like I'm not a fan of this girl and then towards the end when she was getting kicked off then I started to like her and then Paradise play wish you were here more right actual emotion and not just kind of I'm all about the jokes that's when I think people relate to hurt more right right so that was great I mean I don't I don't like you said you were there so we don't know so we don't want anybody trying to avoid most spoilers obviously something's got ruined for us but we try and try not to so I think that is going to be out of the bulls that are together right now who do you like kind of root for the most or C sticking together I mean Dylan had a really cute together and I actually really like those to deal with as such like a surfer feel colorite like it's only because John Paul Jones is so much more of that that you're not seeing how much Dylan is like Dylan McKenna cute ways Aquaman she's so hot right it's a lot of that you are like my favorite little brother that I want to go hang out with who else I really like and I mean I don't want to say something that might ruin something exactly like teen I forgot I actually am present backlight Sadie's down there I like beat like Dean's the I like really respect Dean's way of life I cook that I could never do it right like hit his life sounds so cool but also sounds like my fucking nightmare you know it's like it seems like it just one big Burning Man like in like in theory it sounds cool but then you get there and you're like oh God I can't I can't do this like I have you Stoneleigh porta potties for the past like 3 months so I kept I appreciate his like just like travel around the world you know kind of like laissez-faire attitude ever do it but I do like Dina he's a he's a very good like I think that Dean will be a good example for Blake down the road like you can be kind of a kind of an F boy and then kind of kind of resurrect your percent honesty like it was an asshole incident like drina's just owned it and when you own it people are like okay that's that's fairly bright just got to own up to that yeah Dean openly being like hey I just like to travel around
