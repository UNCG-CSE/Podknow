I won't rest until we get it in the dictionary like you've been right all along it's a no-brainer it's stupid to fight and there are people I mean Rory himself when I was Instagram story and said one of his great pet peeves people that use golf at in the scent golf what are you doing golfing t-shirt golfing. Go to store. Parcel sports.com there's a golf page we all kinds of good stuff on there for Peeta Mellark two T-shirts that just say golfing on them we've got it all might have to get a hat if those t-shirts continued cell and continue to sell well to where I realize there's a man I will put golfing. On a rope hat will put it on everything everything everything but I had got it on a belt just in between each Loop coughing coughing coughing coughing will put it on everything so by those shirts they're cool things on a Peter Millar piece of clothing then it's a takeover copyright like the script in the in the teacher says golfing. And we just put that on a few more quarter-zip hundred fifteen bucks you got coffee coffee cuz I'm drinking it right now Poland Spring Water online wrong know you're wrong you're wrong you tweets were like Frankie you're right she comes in a Studio B in Bridgewater right now in the office here's why your I'm not alright will you guys admit to say that when you said that drinking out of a tab was essentially less poor than drinking a Poland Spring Water you guys were incorrect in New York City ID I stand by that so the sink that you like can spit your toothpaste into or like wash your bean dip out in is less poor than going to a store and buying a nice-looking bottle Poland Spring water which to my wife to further my point we played Liberty National Golf Course yesterday golf club is that it is closed course of course maybe one of the most exclusive courses in the entire world is that cuz that's where I was but you're going on and it succeeded City Exclusive by stream the water that they provide for all these people that belong to this extremely exclusive golf club was what Poland Spring water every single hole that had water waiting for us Poland Spring in our golf cart Poland Spring you think that these guys were helicoptering in from their apartment on Park Avenue to go play Liberty National Guard drink poor people water while we were the only ones out there that day will they were we were the ones who were going to play it early morning maybe they planned for us they think we're poor people in a Poland Spring water good for in the golf course was going to be the only other people out there on the only other people there were actually the only two workers were taking down all stressed ants from your speaking down upon Liberty National that they would never resort to any sort of lesser I only water at Liberty National you're really high standards think I think and I'm saying I don't know what they are well then that's something now that's all you got to figure out of that because I know what I saw saw your emailed us and said subject line Frankie is an idiot body of the email as soon today's pod and just couldn't help myself falling Springs is nearly as acidic enough to dissolve your teeth fuck bottle water Frankie idea that guy's a psychopath like I'll do I said this out earlier you know he sent a long thing you said he works for Nestle who is owns Poland Springs that he feels obligated to give us all this information is the poor version of Poland Spring like Nestle Nestle Water you're like what am I drinking like a like chocolate milk I said the chocolate milk is just a little like resident Nestle to me but I understand reset Palm Springs 100% natural spring water from Maine it's coming straight from the earth the bosom of the earth and into a bottle there for the government never gets his hands on it like your precious City water thing he goes on to be all right if you love America and you love Poland Springs you kind of schitt's on Fiji for that reason he said it's regional spring water only soil in Northeast so pure and never travels more than 300 miles from from the spring to your mouth I get that he works for the company is going on and on and on some propaganda in their propaganda it's just pure propaganda this is this is a propaganda email or Kyle or Sawyer Sawyer sitting down like spitting into a cup saying that my Poland Spring water is going to burn by Passion whereas some rats falling out of the sky in our apartment in our building right now at Barstool Sports are African midget who works where was here at 5 in the morning he said that a mouse ran out and jumped out of the water dispenser here at Barstool sports.com and you guys are telling me that any chance that have a mouse or rat or anything in the Linings of the pipes that your water gets put from a water filter like machine that that's like not part of the tap water operation that's an additional thing that Barstool added all I'm saying is that I drink so much of that water on Friday after hearing that that Mouse news in here till the other day and then it's just like I also clarified he said he saw the the mouse running like on top of the thing he never said he never saw it inside the saying is that to say that something coming out of it out of a faucet is cleaner or less polar than going out and buying a product where it gets bottled and put branding on it is insane water doesn't come from the tap it doesn't who does what's a naturally filtered spring water from Maine that's what it says millions of people live in Manhattan think about how clean the water has to be for it to be coming through our faucets it can't even be a little bit dirty or acidic or have any sort of poison is in the faucet if that happens then the entire city in New York is going to die and they just can't have that happen they have to be sure that water is clean and the same goes for the 5 billion billion Poland Spring bottles that have literally a company name to it as opposed to a city which has so much more to lose by putting any acidity inside their water or any dirt is that a water cuz they can just go down there publicly traded company that worried about the palm tree imagine about stop making his goddamn box this is a premium lot of water you guys are going for the free version coming straight out of the tap that's not for you to pay at bagels and pizza is better in New York is because the water is more pure than your cigarette that is correct more pure than like the stuff that's happening and what was that sound like to expensive because this is natural spring water that they have to filter out of a they understand we can make their these companies that are so focused on putting on such a great product would they do that no they realize they're getting the same quality for free you're the idiot that paying way more for something that's not better you're wrong you're wrong to premium product bottles of water becomes a 24-pack you told me that that's not more prettier than just turning on my faucet next to where I took a dump premium because you are bored I'm saying you're dumb for paying for us what I'm saying that's a mistake with all the stuff that goes into it like the Purity that's what they want you to drink a picture of a river on there oh it's so much better picture of the top they don't have to because it's fucking it's just tap water it's good dressing at work that's why I like this part is email at Kyle sent us I like that it says it's so pure never travels more than 300 miles from Spring to email where's 301 where's the cutoff to point you know where is the truck stop to me that you don't think that you guys think I've big waters bad for you that's nuts I don't think it's worth what you pay for it it is a difference of that one I don't think that's not worth that it you know why because they've done an unbelievable job market Burnside water Keeps Me Alive games versions of tap water that are bad there's version to bottle but I'm sure that are bad I can't kill you my tap water ain't killing me but tell they don't have to do it it's creating the best of us and bagels at what's the what's the town I'm going to have a real ID Michigan Michigan if that's ever happened to me out of the tap and I'm now I'm out I'm out on water they were literally sending in bottles of water in Flint Michigan because there's hot water was telling them how they weren't sending Poland Spring well I just want the argument thank you short water has first bottled water that's what we were talking about so you think of Flint Michigan's is was going to happen a minute it could very because if there's a fucking nuclear attack in New York City. Stream Thor the stream that and so it's safe if there's a nuclear attack I agree that bottled water better than tap water everything I drink everything is adding up to the point that bottle of water is better than tap water clear attack your correct and in just life general in general I don't agree with that well then I don't know what to tell you because you're wrong you're wrong no I'm not.

the show in a few minutes Stacy Lewis withdrew so I haven't I guess two weeks ago she messed up her back shed I guess then today's recording on Tuesday today is Tuesday she she withdrew and AC went on to say I didn't want to have to make that decision but what's best for the team as a whole situation where Ally McDonald is the first alternate not allow an alternate is not allowed to actually play the course during the week until unless obviously somebody withdraw so she kind of had to make the decision early of like a and if this is girl Allie was a rookie wants to be able to of course and practice and get in the groove in the end all that stuff then she's got to withdraw so she did just made that decision that was just released a few minutes ago that shows coming out on Thursday we found this out on Tuesday right now as we recording rule rules rules rules rules is rules should you play it on a simulator simulator that be great thank you be funny if I didn't want you to get outside the box something to think about for the solheim cup going forward Gleneagles the solheim cup will be on Golf Channel all weekend long Bronte law we out of the show last week so you're up is a two-to-one underdog despite the fact that they play on home soil us has won the last couple a one pretty handily I believe in Iowa was that in Des Moines the capital of Iowa is that Cedar Rapids what do you mean I don't know I don't know what it is about it man you got the jdc bad taste in mouth although it's not an Iowa yes everything about the midwives I take that back I like that we had such a good time took the train into that was the Iowa what time is the Cedar Rapids so the train is in Coralville you take a train from Coralville Iowa City which the train stops right next to kinnick Stadium Iowa City all that stuff was probably top three college towns I've been in it's a good time with a great show except there's no sense crazy we can get the experience at the bar scene which I'm sure it's good it's great you train a horse I can say old school train everyone's like pumped out there playing music on it and like you take a train ride to the stadium it's like a slow-moving like it's like a gimmick train but like yeah it it makes me feel like you're taking the LIRR something at the train is to take Iowa football fans from that spot I later it's is really cool people on top of that the buildings Barstow flags and stuff in the talent is awesome let's do a Casey's General Store Pizza Hut score but his what was the score gave it Five Points something Sims 2 bacony that's right Dad famously met him that Dave you know this was after the review would come out I'm so it all of Iowa had dismissed with David said essentially and they didn't want to believe that anyone can say something was to be a kitty and Trent's dad like shook his head and then they won't they were on their way I like going to like do something whenever and as he's walking out if he's just shaking his head and just disbelief and we could hear him in the hallways but I just don't know how you can have too much bacon just to himself that is my dad was distraught days I guess I was just too big of a just like I had just don't know how you can have too much bacon my dad oneself my day. Compute he could not believe it and I know I don't love that someone can say or do I just this is too much I'm not kidding when I say the review came out probably noon and we we did the show at like 2 or something in Iowa City right on the campus right near kinnick I thought we're going to ride on our hands the review is out and people were mad people are upset that's well that's one of your guys like go to Zedge your stomach news is Casey's General Store Pizza it was like adipose good like I know it like it's it's a gas station I know it's a general store for the fuck that mean they sell gas there they happen to sell gas that you can fill your car up with gas if you need to tow it sounds like a station where you can fill up the journals are pretty good price of Iowa's it was pretty tasty it was pretty tasty that's a gas station it's breakfast pizza likes it except Dave my dad makes breakfast pizza brothers would do a lot of catering and some people like cater at like 10 in the morning whenever the headlights like big events at Bradley's and he'll always bring up breakfast pizzas and people like on the new in the Northeast I feel I don't really know that much about breakfast pizzas and like he acts like he likes like invented it he'll come out and take a bacon egg and cheese pizza and people going crazy for him racing miss you just can't wait for them to go nuts it's a bacon egg and cheese on a pizza All That Jazz brought you all the way out in the show last week was very cool big call her daddy fan daddy gang she said I'd love to know if we said that we weren't the favorites but I think that's interesting we have our home court advantage I'd say we've seen the course before this week we have a lot of players that are playing really well and really good golf right now I'm not sure what sort of information they're getting their kind of basically laughing at the thought of them being under dogs at all especially to 100. There's plenty of animosity there she confirmed on the show that they're making fun of the American girls on their group text all the time to Inkster said that that's not going on but I find that hard to believe him you have to make fun of the other team approach to that to them being listed as underdogs I don't like that I think you go like okay you guys think we're underdogs then we're underdogs were going to beat you guys her being like I were actually should be the favorite in star of a strange way to approach I would embrace the underdog role a lot of pressure for sure if you keep threatening this big of a game right how to get off the pressure to be like know where the favorites yeah I mean I guess me as a fan of General fan of the whole thing I like this response could both teams are claiming has been the favorites which creates more animosity if one just conceded it was like yeah where the other dogs were going to go in and really try to get her that doesn't Christmas bulletin board material beforehand but I do think from a competitor standpoint a better idea to capture that you know that Underdog mentality and harness it be like yeah a lot of people you know picking against us in like we're here to prove people wrong somebody that not Ascension I say like they're wrong we are actually going to dominate I like to prove people wrong stance better meet you at Tina's birthday today the king I don't know anybody's ever been more universally admired athletic how he's right up there is awesome it's just like I mean I don't like it's like when my one friend I would say it's my boyfriend's favorite baseball players make you mad now it's like you didn't watch any YouTube play it and experience it and that's why I'm so by so like the guys now you know like I don't know, is a great name just like Babe Ruth is and just like all this stuff but I mean yeah it is interesting that the only real Arnold Palmer's have the we experience was like the a drink. Will that but also like the way down there are already being like these guys were great and we just watch them do first season how do you say you know he's an influential figure and he was awesome but all time great day it is it is different when it's like we watch we never really got too many things to say about the I only know things that like someone just told me and I watched like a highlight on I mean I mean I feel like I can always expand more on the guy that I've lived with and then watched a lot of Arnold Palmer story do it like Matt Arnold Palmer's he did this they never liked forgot anybody's name that he went out of there with his way all ways to make everybody in the room feel like this that so maybe those are just been glorified and all that I wear a legend in like at the time or did he was the first he was legitimately like the first does first like athletic star to actually become like a business in second door is all that and a big 3 of like him jack Geary like would have never existed of that whole thing with all that stuff and so he will judge it like created the whole endorsement business for athletes and he was on commercials all the times forever is good and obviously a stud so good-looking wild reputation for just being like the nicest most friendly most warming guy in the world and all that kind of went into and he was really fucking good what about you make it your all that kind of went into him becoming you know one of the biggest name I mean by the second biggest name in the history of the Tiger Woods Arnold Palmer Jack's the greatest player of all time on the leg is really any dispute the most Majors but I think Palmer career yeah yeah he's had a great career Jack Arnold Palmer it's like a bigger name to Jack Nicklaus golf and all that my boss has a way long way because like 12 year olds and I'm not on a bomber every time you type in Arnold Palmer and you see a new picture pop up it's like it's crazy to think that this is a real human being I mean is wearing like tight fitted like polo shirt but that he like he's fucking assuming most of the pictures were in black and white and this thing looks like a painting almost anywhere and yellow pants blue tight shirt like I mean people must have saw him walking around in a time where am I fashion was not like this and they like who the fuck is this sex King like pull my arms are just a little more OB bag are common man ride the other Common Man swing or he had the helicopter finish she just like I love when he's smoking cigarettes and pictures makes him seem so Kool cigarettes are so cool you know I'm always amazed that people think that I don't know what it is it's in my it's not me it's my it's my brain that looks at someone smoking a cigarette I'm like that's fair and clearly has that effect on a lot of people to me I just look at it like that's disgusting I like I like I got who you see do it you look at this picture on a Palmer smoking a dart you're not getting any like that guy is cool or like we watch Grease Mad Men smoking I always think there's a bit of matter what smoking cigarettes does a bit of like yeah I know this is bad for me I don't care he's actually retarded review with Jon Hamm Jeremy Renner all the guys from the movie tag and title name is in there and when we got to the place we had to wait like 5 or 10 minutes for the pizza will be ready and throw some of the other celebrities to get there and Jon Hamm obviously from Mad Men was sitting there was like leaning against the wall and he took out like a cigarette box and smacked against his hand and took out a dart instead of ripping it and like leaning against the wall at looking up in like blue the smoke out and I was just staring at him like wow he's on draperies Don Draper's doing the thing right now it's like a glass of whiskey a drag Cool Math so cool you're like us what you probably argue with some of the show you're trying to get as much time as possible try

said all time for play at Barstool sports.com that's the email has to say from the gallery otherwise I won't see it cuz I I search from the gallery is a little when I search if you don't put that I won't read it Tucker says hey I'm a freshman in college Place High School golf for four years my senior year we got really cool T-Maxx my question is at what point is it weird for me to still use my high school golf bag never I think it's awesome if it's a little looking bag my East Meadow Golf bag is a little like blue and yellow it's too loud I have it in my in my shed at my house actually just recently saw a little ship me some of golf bag but yeah I don't I mean if it's a cool-looking bag using forever I'm not like very proud of what my back looks like so I don't use it I ice a rocket for anytime you have a golf bag that's just different than like going to a Golf Galaxy in buying a standard that's cool that's just way cool was going to sort of spin this off into another question of like how do you guys feel about buy a golf bag with a logo of a golf club that you like don't belong It's Tricky by like if you go to if you go you get a virus alert by bag and we actually had this discussion later the same talk about it cuz mpcc has this unreal logo and wrapped around like a golf a flag and Winged Foot has an all-time logo so it's like well if I'm not a member of these clothes but I got to play it once and you buy a sick bag that is that a weird move I want to say that you should be able to battle that you can answer my questions and then I don't want anyone ask him a Bible on their side no actually yeah it seems a little too permanent just a little and Frank is right answer a lot of questions. And you think you get roasted how bad you want to see me as a wife Waltz on their way to wait. So you don't want that. Clouds out there it's been in front of me for 30 minutes I'm drinking out of my eye water out of my for play Orca which you can get it stored up parcel coming through like a filter that we have here that's fine if you don't want to like whatever I'm just saying we're not to get back in the whole thing is someone listening I do buy a lot of stuff I don't know if there's like a plug right on your laptop tonight I'm sick right now because I wouldn't ask if I didn't have that you ran out that's how this whole thing began he said we need an hour what if you got it sitting on cases of water I've got case is Samantha coming out of the Fall a fall out of cabinets when you over the counter you go looking for like a new trash bag and put in just water clear rolling out of it and it just add water on the side of the bottle send you a picture when I get back we'll look into some of the KC Zoo clothes you left behind it was behind there's like four case of One Bad Boys 2 when they have so much money that the rats are eating the money and it's just in every corner of the house it's in the walls it's in there and falling out and that's what you're like with water that's us with water like the TV is just sitting on water we got to go back into that either but I got to plug that you should read that I wrote about the wires going to do it like my mom comments on my wires should commit suicide they should put a gun in their mouth pull the trigger I will not apologize and I will go to their funeral and lick the tears off their mother's cheeks don't comment on my wires I do whatever I want my wires I'll put more HDMI cords on the floor that aren't even plugged in she's so exposed if you have a chance to tuck them in just tuck them in you know whatever Tyler has a whole are are we like are you reading Tyler's question here College questions next just read an article about Bryson including the quote from Kevin Na say that Bryson cares about three things Golf fortnite and girls he goes on to say it is from the other question do you think Bryson analyzes his bedroom game is acts the same way he does his golf game that's hilarious I think he does for sure I just got to get that perfect stroke perfect stroke he said he wrote LOL got to get that perfect stroke when she nailed I think it's easy as life you talk about neurotic I think he's exactly the same way where he's just like everything's got to be like when he gets to his dinner table like it's like well I guess we're not using the right steak knife through this filet mignon would be used for the steak knife and all this stuff so like I think it would I mean what I've seen I mean Bryson does pretty well girls game he's a good-looking dude the girls that he's getting with a good-looking women I think that you know he's analyzing it correctly is what I'm going to say yeah he's fucking I think he's talking he's smart and he's also like you know he's uses in so deep nice like a dick wow yeah yeah funny cuz I think Bryson listen to the show so that's why I like I love it. I love you listen to us talk about what we think about him fucking chicks or potentially potentially I could be I could be in this position and getting this much as fashion but you are resorting to this position and for that reason I'm out things like walks out of the room when I just turned it into what's the Shark Tank sharks mid sex no I think it's at dinner he likes it or doesn't listen I've been really going over the numbers and Live While We're not giving our dimension for we're doing in there is just not we're not utilizing you know everything that we got that out me to maximize what's going on the maximize efficiency I'm coming at this angle and what you're doing with that position is not sufficient enough to get maximum pleasure so he's I got the protractor I'm bringing in the level yep we're going to straighten things out if you got to be 3° this way got to be he just got to be three degrees that way if you got to be perpendicular I do this for a living. I just not matching up I think that's what he does my practice Simulator 2 little robots just said it was like pulling the trigger on that I don't know it sounded like we do that otherwise I go to wedding Drake I tried to order transfusion I talked about this a couple times are difficult to do and try to and the lady looked at me like I offended her she was like what did you just say you're not just ordering a vodka soda with a line am I guess what 85000 people ahead of you just order as a vodka ginger ale and grape juice and she's like okay walking to the back. What I thought was grape juice she started pouring a drink it was like a light orange color it was grapefruit juice it was the worst thing ever drink I took one sip of it put it down taste like an armpit it did it tasted so bad taste like this thing tastes like Bo bottled up into a glass special drink yeah the groom and the bride chimed in and they have like a small it's usually it's like two maybe three and they gave him a special name and then use order that cuz everybody was Beyonce almost like 90% of us when you go out to a bar you are one of the year like the most vulnerable you'll ever be when it comes to choices like at the person in front of you orders like OJ or certain drink jump so you just go with whatever is on that little menu now the other situation always going to end up in at a wedding is right at the beginning of the reception when you sit down you're already have three drinks in front of you every time you have that small little glass of champagne toast did they come around like would you like wine red wine done and then you've also grabbed at least a drink from the bar before hand so you sit down next to United looking at 3 drinks get a little bruised up for the dance floor game on in every situation so that's what I would go with the drinks I like that a lot I got to have a confession to make it just hit me like a ton of bricks when I shouldn't have to say this because it goes kind of against my argument but not really because of how passionate been back to the water thing real quick I don't I don't want to get into it don't respond to this all right when I'm at a restaurant like a nice restaurant they say would you like bottled or tap I always attack but that's because I don't want to go through the whole process of like getting the bottled water it's not because of a cleanliness thing and I just called myself out on this bullshit I just thought of it cuz when you said like I would you like wine I always say I was going to say there's sometimes water on the glass on the table too and then I got thinking you know what this restaurant I was just that to me as you is why do you not just go to the bar cuz it's a whole thing you guys got to go in the back and get a bottle and then I'm afraid of people seeing me get like a bottle of water which actually also plays into my point where it's like a premium it's a premium drink and I don't want to seem like I'm like a I don't know I said when you're in public and you just like give me the whatever just give me the water but if it was that much better you would think you would do all the time true but you be like oh no I pay for it on a date why would I pay for it right nostril strongly believe in what I've talked about the first half an hour in the show I'm just letting you know that I'm a big enough person to admit that I was at a restaurant recently the guy said would you like bottled or tap and I flipped them off and said Taps fine I like it a little finger in Lake Tapps fine really helps your argument it's just I don't want to be like ritzy like go give me the Evian you know but that's what you do on a daily basis four-person water might be a job interview

time I'm assuming you didn't ask because the answer is just the greatest game ever played it's a very good one I don't think it's the best what so Sam asked what is the greatest golf movie of all time the answer is the greatest game ever played Francis ouimet the country club are you fucking kidding me it's a great story I don't hit the greatest golf movie Tin Cups a good movie but it's like a comedy I keep you laughing but it's reliable elmore's but 10 cups related like the movie because those are our greatest right like isn't greatest like all right there's a fucking great movie or funny I got put those two in different kind of bites a greater subjective in any case I like I watch the greatest game ever played none like that is a fantastic movie from beginning and good acting like great storyline the whole thing like the way that they do the data cry when he's on top of the guy shoulder and he's looking at his dad's dad finally acknowledged Francis ouimet like this is it you did it God it's incredibly play hits has a real story line at the underneath there's like real dramatic relationships and like emotions are go into it. I think a lot before I get a tear in her eye at the end of the fucking finally holes that shot out it's also very loud when you stand on the range hood like he stand there like 97 gimmicks are trying to figure it out cuz he's got the shakes that shit's great so I think Tin Cup 10 cups we've had this discussion many such as a MRSA radio about like what is the difference between greatest movie funniest movie like like I feel like they should be a different categories the same reason why I like like Avengers won't win like best movie right side whatever makes things have to be in different categories I get it to I would say I would go to a couple of the greatest game ever played a drama try it is I agree with that but I also again I don't think like having Happy Gilmore is like a gimmicky yes for sure I said he's he's little swing and he's got a hockey stick pattern all that is like it's like all about like the relationship and his like relationship with cough and what could have been and how he has the skill to like be on the PGA tour but he's too much of a head case in like too much of a party boy in this and that and it actually turns into kind of like unfolding in this very emotional way at the end I think brought chokes a lot of people at the end when he's like melting down you're like oh my God you got a dying inside cuz he's come this far so I think there's a it's not like on the same scale as I can so hard every time I watch it every single time every time the funniest movies it is something hilarious it's so good shooter everything about it's so good it's such an enjoyable movie it's like where is that right yeah it's tough but it probably doesn't count it greatest golf movie if you're going to be like all you got to watch this golf story like what are you going to show someone if you have one chance to be like a watch this golf story golf movie like it's about golf like when you going to show him I feel like Gracie Barra place I can take a historical reenactment of the game about I agreed that I would say on the whole I guess kind of kind of missing a lot of like Sirius golf movies in a refresh my brain like The Legend of Bagger Vance I've never seen that movie that right we Will Smith no I swear I had not I've never seen that with Matt Damon and Will Smith in a golf wow is very good I may have it I mean I'm going to watch Will Smith is like this mysterious like mysterious guy who arrives and like Matt Damon is this like really struggling golfer whose go to bed and really sick and then it will Smith like appears in his like helping him out of his caddy and start working right now. That's a good husband came out in 2010 what like 10 seconds later because he was out and I didn't say I wouldn't just describing a I was just warning you and that movie just came out to you at a 42% Rotten Tomatoes likes what is the greatest game ever played out of tomatoes to all you got to look at the user score audience score for greatest game ever played 82% very high Legend of Bagger Vance typing it in I just can't home and he just can't do it. Loading Legend of Bagger Vance Bagger Vance 65% audience score that's it for the old school movie Vargas kind of got that I was actually that helps me there aren't a ton of great dramatic golf movies right there just aren't a lot of think there will be a movie about Tiger Woods life oh yeah super well done One mic start from the beginning like he's a little kid who plays I don't know you got to think there's like a really I think they find like us some of that looks like you might not know who it is or was at each stage of his life you know I mean Delphine it conducts is a cat he'll be on the show potting like on the game show and stuff like I can see that right now happen if you think I'll do it like dark like the book kind of authority A celebratory you got to have dark to make it interesting to tell the whole story but then he'll never sign off on it but I don't think he has to iMovie but we don't like stand by to Reggie's Bass the whole movie of the book and a bike The Last 5 Years or ten years that he's going to have that you have a pretty good movie for my Freddie Mercury how he liked did like the told them that he had AIDS and all the stuff like they accept away from what the movie meant so yeah I guess that you can do whatever the fuck you want a tiger would like a twenty-four-year-old Tiger Woods we don't know who it is we have an outbreak if you have to and then I mean just look at the movies obviously Caddyshack shop there too but that's kind of I think that's almost a little bit more like you make it too and sometimes Caddyshack is like I love Caddyshack it's got so many horrible things out like so it's it's just a movie that will forever live on is just a very very funny movie for all golfers people like Spalding all that stuff you say certain things on the golf course but I mean it's I sometimes get like sick of like just cuz it's so old I can't get into it like kind of like funny comedy Classic golf movies where if you look at like football subject is a million golf there's there's two of them even know right but I would like if you could just make it the same name let you go cuz they play on Sunday I was just trying to think of like how you could slide another golf term in the any in any On Any Given part but I don't know how you could all given cuz it's like you give up any given with the free one of the young filmmakers out there any given open Brenda seapot close by the Sea Sunday.

Com code for play 20 hi folks we are now joined by a very special guest for the third consecutive time captain of the US Women's solheim Cup team juli Inkster welcome to the show for the first time yeah I've heard a lot about you guys so don't let me down first question are you currently holding a cup that says vodka tonic on the side of it don't tell the officers of law but yeah that's that that's my go-to drink that always so you like to mix it up or where we at with that are you guys like that I'm pretty pretty basic I like that and then maybe his balls out with a nice glass of wine so you don't have to wind down and that's the way I wind down imagine so where y'all get close week and a half or so out what's the stress level right now what's the nervous level where we at with that well I have a young team I have five rookies on my team I have four also players that never played overseas before they played in one so high and so I have a really young team and playing overseas in Scotland and now the home of golf is pretty intimidating by itself and then you throw in the solheim cup representing your country and the LPGA and your teammates but they're very quiet but they I think they carry a big stick you know you don't really know how they're going to react until I get out there so my job is to try to make them as comfortable as they can and try to put them in situations where they can succeed how do you get them ready for something like that so you said they're young it's going to be intense there be an enemy territory you do anything that you like scaring them like what are you doing to get him ready scare tactic tactic you know I just tried it try not to make it any bigger than it is you know it's overwhelming for them in the first place you know I don't need him to give me 150% I just need him to give me what they have a hundred percent you know I just tried it could just go out there and play like it's a Thursday or Friday we're going to do great but when he tried to make it bigger than it is sometimes that gets in your way of what you're trying to accomplish how do you how do you cut it dial back the emotions because you if you go out there and you know they're raising the roof going on crazy crowds is different than any other week out there and tore that any of them will ever experience how do you kind of prep them so that they don't just go like you said 200 miles an hour when they need to be cruising at like 65 it's hard but so you know I've been constantly talking to him constantly gets stuck in their ear just letting them know that you know you're going to hit some bad shot you know you just got to laugh at it and move on you know the more the more pressure you put on this out yourself the worst you're going to play so I try to keep it really loose in a locker room just so you know we we got some some things planned it that kind of maybe I'll take the stress off of them a little bit and just basically the bottom line is and you're trying to make memories for them for a lifetime you know golf if you win it's great but also my job is to make it fun in and make them enjoy the week so we have what we we found in our lives that in order to kind of keep it loose and feel motivated you make fun of your opponents and we had brought to you off in here last week and she revealed that the European team on their tax group texts have been making fun of the American team so have you guys been making fun of the European team to keep it Loose know we haven't by no it's not a lie but we might start activities planned I think you need a trash talk session where you guys just make fun of your play I like the way you guys are thinking you know what kind of boggles my mind that because bronte's some of her best friends are on my team and she's talking shit about him I'm going to have to bring that up to be a nice little lakh rupees for me thanks guys, so I've got this massive for us not a problem we be good at that will MC the whole thing so what kind of Advantage you know it's obviously it's over there Gleneagles Scotland what type of Advantage do they have being able to play in front of the home crowd set it up all that kind of stuff how big of an advantage is that how do you kind of counter that or what's the approach yeah we're going to be heard but our job is to make it as quiet as possible out there and I'll try not to get a lot of blue on the board just try to keep it to you know on Sunday and Jeremy I mean you could have dropped a pen and and heard it so you know they're going to be starting on Friday like a basketball game weather that first eight to 10 minutes weather the storm a little bit and settle in and then and then just you know play your own game but it's going to be intimidating and I'm not going to lie to you it's it's hard but I can't I got a really strong mental group so I'm just going to rely on them to get to be able to figure it out himself your golf is a very individual game everybody does everybody some people have emotions on and off for some people are just Flatline I can't because that's just not their personality so they got to figure it out themselves but were there to help you figure it out of course been incredibly successful in your solheim cup career both as a player and as a captain you know how hard is it for you to not be able to hit a shot and not playing these things it's hard but on the other hand I'm kind of glad I'm not doing it anymore it's stressful but yeah it's hard because I I I mean I prefer to years that was my goal to make the solheim Cup team always make the solheim Cup team cuz I just I just love Max play I love the mono mono just me and them out there competing on some people thrive and I don't like it at all cuz I don't like that stuff you know I was I was one and I was like that and I think that's why I was successful and that's play one of my favorites are you actually do you enter the people's women's golfer Danielle Kang we've had her on the show many times how how difficult is she to real in up there I don't want her to be Daniel Kang she's going to play a lot with the flu and maybe with Megan khang but she's fiery She's the man I had her as a rookie last year and I put her in the last spot and single because I knew she could handle it and I knew she wanted it and you got to want to be the last person to play and she she wants the ball so I just go ahead and give it to her Peter the boss keep seeing her the ball and she she's got a little like me and said that she gets fired up for these things and I'm happy that she's on my team yeah I hate you know I think it's cool that the two sisters are playing in the solheim cup and you know I think it would be an injustice if I didn't put them together so yeah they'll be out there probably not every every match that they'll definitely playing together at least one maybe two just recently made to Captain's picks Morgan Pressel Stacy Lewis and Veterans when it comes to this thing how difficult was was you know we're both of those decisions well it was tough for me it was just a few I'll tell him I could cristie Kerr that she's not on the team or a Paula Creamer that she's not on the team or Angela Stanford and veterans that have been stalwarts on the solheim cup but all kinds of the Colts is my team and and I gave him four or five pics you know who do guys like to play with and Stacy and Morgan were the most popular choices in and you know if I really felt like I had to get a point I think I could count on both of them so Thomaston a veteran leadership that I needed out there so it was tough but I think it was too good pics for my team so it's obviously very there's a lot going on during these things you're the captain there is the minimum amount is 44 matches you know going on at a time you can only file one group at a time how do you get all your information in real time so I have like I have the cold helpers and so I send a group out with everybody and they got a walkie-talkie and so if I get a call that says hey I got my groups leaking leaking while we need some help out here I'm the only one allowed to give information so they they kind of radio me and say hey we need some help out here and then I get out there and and go try to get him a little little talk or maybe just give him a little vodka tonic I don't know if that's a hell of a strategy yeah some chapters juice give me some Captain D's you ever get me bad information ever been given bad information no no no I've had the same kind of helpers the last two times so I know what I'm getting with my group how much you know your days are it's it's 36 holes how how much does kind of your plan ever change based on morning players a pretty sentence don't know I I'm I'm one that if I feel like someone is not playing well do you know why I put them out there and make them struggle meal in the afternoon usual say hey take the afternoon off to go to the range work on it get some rest and then I'm going to need you tomorrow so you know I don't I don't like riding a dead horse so they know that but that and also over there the weather is not going to be it looks like it's going to be rainy and and cold and and it's hard to play turn that stuff so you know people who are down and so I'm going to have to skip kind of how they're feeling and how do they want to go because honest with me and I don't need any Heroes out there if someone wants to take an afternoon off I rather than tell me that then he put them out there and and then not succeed what's the biggest push back he's got something like that we have the famous incident with Phil and Tom Watson you ever get anything like that where somebody's pissed that they're not going to play you know maybe inside that they really haven't verbalized it to me you know I pissed and Des Moines Michelle we was out there with Daniel Canyon and they were scheduled to go out in the afternoon and Michelle wasn't playing that great and you know I went up to Michelle I said hey I'm going to put Lisette in and you know I need you to let you know that's great I'll go work on my game and I'll be ready for you tomorrow and you know if he didn't give me any pushback she understood why did it and she actually played next morning got me a point so it worked out well I'm at you know I don't do it try to piss anybody off I just do it for you know I try to put the best team out there at that point respect the captain through sounds like so your first time is Captain 2015 you guys are down on in enemy territory 10 to 6 going into the final day did you do anything differently going into that day to turn around and get this miracle win or was it the same message in a what change their how'd that you know again it's got to come from them you know we had a little bit of an incident with the ruling whatever and it kind of went against us and I think that really fired my team up and they played like you're fired up and we had a huge comeback during a color made a huge putt on 18 to keep it going and everybody has a job in and we ended up winning that thing so sometimes it just takes something from the other team to fire your team up at any point next week aren't going the way I expect you to go out and make a huge scene about some small rules controversy yeah kick a little dirt on her something little bit of idea how we're going to do but you know with all of my rookies and First Time Players I'm not real sure but I like my team I like the makeup of them I seem to have a lot of fire in them so we'll see if that adds up to some points on the board for us and week-out me there's almost no match play when it comes to professional golf LPGA Tour so what are you I mean in your days you know as such a strong horse for the US team and now the third straight Captain see what you guys do to get ready and prepare for Math play with just show different than what you do weekend we got is at practice rounds is it kind of started maybe six months ago with the team and saying Hey I want you guys you don't want Tuesday's trying to play matches like what can you do to get people ready for such a different format than they see every single week girls that live in Florida and so I've been trying to get them out in order to go out and play nine holes alternate shot or basketball or I mean you can go for five holes without hitting an iron and then I'll send you some head and iron her to make it so different than what we play but luckily we had to the Dow championship in Midland Michigan this year and a lot of them played and it was it was basketball foreman and alternate-shot format so all my team played just to kind of get used to playing foursomes and fourballs because over in Europe they grow up the Junior tournament over here we don't so we're a little bit behind the 8-ball that way I always feel like if we can take clothes with them during those matches Lancome singles I think that's where we were a lot more dominant so for the first two days were really critical for us excuses so they had a horrific tire shop yeah I do. I hit one at 5 and the perception of I love both of those me to have a huge excuses out there is massive have you ever had a member of the gallery whether it's in the solheim cup or regular event or whatever ever had a member of the gallery get under your skin no no it cuz they might say something to you but it's not like they follow you around for 18 holes in right field of full-time and they're just constantly in your ear you're always moving around so I have to say I've never really had anybody like that 24/7 make you laugh for the out anybody else anything that you just like I have to laugh at that I hear tell me why can do that it's under your skin but I kind of wish it happened cuz you feel like somebody who go into the crowd I feel like you might just go in there and start fighting I'm a lover not a fighter I can see you like jogging the guys drink of being like yeah what's up now. How do you have any any thoughts on slow play is it a problem professional golf gotten a lot of chatter in the last month or two and you know is it is it a problem professional golf s painful God either a 5-iron or 600 just hit one or the other if it's painful how slow people aren't it's like I mean it drives me crazy I don't like to play slow I mean he just got to be ready to hit when it's your turn and be ready when it's your turn to cut and it's just gotten so Technical and and it's just I don't know is there anything any strategies you had to combat spell play or try to you know battle your way through it I mean Brooks koepka came out and said he would purposely play really slow so they can put on the clock in the slow guys in the group were forced to play faster strategies you ever had to combat slow play Roll my neck and and roll my eyes like really and I'll talk to your job and and you're out there with someone's plants low and you know you're behind and you know you're going to get put on a clock and then when you have to speed up so it's amazing when they do get put on the clock how much better they play so and I just don't understand why they just can't do that all the time has a big Shadow message I love the passive aggressive moves, exactly exactly another one as if your bleeding on like your partner on the right side of your body you switch it over to like the left side view of a real slow like methodical change that's a good move also I forget who so we in a work offers you frequently just don't have it we stink what do you what do you do on days I have is anybody what do you do on days where you just don't have it with your games just it's just not there with your timing is off this that how do you try to combat that as somebody who's been you know one of the more successful players in the Hall of Fame how do you combat that well I mean that's that's the beauty of golf I mean planes for rounds of golf for great rounds of golf to win a golf tournament are you going to have a day where you know you're not hitting the ball very well are you hitting some Neo different shot and then you can rely on your turkey and but I'm a huge believer in doing so you know why the other persons are hitting or something like that all you know stand behind him and maybe just take a couple projects Wing trying to feel what I'm trying to do the bottom line is you got one chance to hit one shot and I'll pay you got if you got to be all in tune so I love I just kind of feel how to get myself back into it by a feeling my my golf swing and feeling my way around it and usually just takes maybe like a shot or two and your life that's what I need to to think think about today because I like one or two things I think about and then just let it go why don't you have to work on that who's your best drinking buddy on tour Patty Hearst easy answer there came right to her what's the most fun you've ever had on the golf course he has to be a

round and choking it away a little bit and plugged it in the bunker on number 7 and I had no lie and I hit a really great shot out in the making par there and then I put it in the next couple I love chat with my stuff, DT and never do the next couple holes and ended up winning by 5 so that was probably one of the most important so what's the next next week what's the gear look like the solheim
