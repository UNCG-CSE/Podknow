Tracy V Wilson dime Holly Frey Welcome to our two part episode about the time the US Central Intelligence Agency orchestrated a coup to overthrow the democratically elected president of Guatemala mr1 we gave an overview of US policy is it related to Central America especially if we talked about how it evolved in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries we also talked about United Fruit Company and how it came to be a major player in Guatemala and elsewhere very brief look at Guatemala's history up to the presidency of Juan Jose Arevalo just sweeping reforms in Guatemala after being elected president after the October Revolution that was a lot to cover I strongly recommend listening to part one before listening to this episode cuz that recap is just the tip of the iceberg for an episode that also is a tip slightly larger tip of the iceberg at this point United Fruit Company was Guatemala's largest employer and its largest single landowner and it had a monopoly on the banana industry United Fruit Company also control the railroad in the port of the utilities and the United Fruit Company that all of these changes that the array below administration had made were threatening its business and I will talk about today the CIA increasingly thought they were evidence of a communist threat that needed to be dealt with as we mentioned in part 1 Juan Jose a table has Administration started to struggle in its later years he faced increasing criticism especially from Guatemala's Elite and he weathered multiple coup attempts one of his most vocal critics increasingly became a colonel Francisco a dona aranha had served in the military during the week of administration and had been part of the coup that overthrew is interim successor General Federico pain say he had also been are the military Junta that had temporarily run Guatemala during part of the October Revolution from there he had become a rainbow Lowe's Chief of the Armed Forces but Orana increasingly disagreed with a lot of a table has labor reforms he finally resigned his position so that he could run for president once a real is turn was up and he also threatened to launch a coup telling the president that he would be overthrown from office if he did not dismiss his whole cabinet and replace them with men of piranhas choosing after he did this array below informed his advisers of this plot and they all agreed that are on a should be exiled what happened next is actually not entirely clear but on July 18th 1949 around I was ambushed and killed Arevalo had given the order that he be apprehended and Ivana ski rival for the presidency Colonel hakoba arbenz Guzman also knew about the order but it is not clear whether a rave so ordered out on a captured or killed who fired the first shot when it happened or exactly what are bends knew about what was going on this was an incredibly fragile moment for Guatemala's new democracy an uprising spread through Guatemala City which involved around his military supporters about a hundred and fifty people were killed in 200 were wounded before the government regain control the United States also became a lot more wary of Guatemala's government and of hackable are beds so did United Fruit Company and the following May United Fruit Company lobbyist Thomas Corcoran held his first meeting to discuss a US overthrow of the area below presidency Fork around later became United Fruit Company is liaison to the CIA remember 11th 1950 hakoba are bands was elected president of Guatemala got 65% of the vote he took office in 1951 and he started trying to build on a table as earlier and to solidify the changes that had already been made his administration also started trying to get out from under United Fruit companies multiple monopolies I billion Newport and a new highway to it and a new electric plant so even though there had been all of this questionable like possible assassination previously like that the fact that there was supposed to be a democratic election and that it didn't happen if there was a peaceful transition of power would like still a really important moment in Guatemalan history are both also started trying to make the Land Reform Arevalo had started to go even further many of arrival is new policies and programs had mostly affected the Guatemalan middle class they had not as much affected the lives of the country's poorest agricultural workers arbenz thought the key to improving these peoples circumstances was a land redistribution program which would put more of the countries on motivated land directly into the hands of people who could Farm it themselves at this point 70% of the land in Guatemala was controlled by 2% of the population of all the land that was being controlled by Major landowners only 1/4 of it was actually being used to grow anyting United Fruit Company was the largest single landowner in Guatemala controlling 40% of the arable land but only cultivating 10 to 15% of it on top of that in retaliation for the changes in the Guatemalan government United Fruit Company had started laying off workers and refusing to rebuild banana plantations that had been damaged in storms unless the government restored its earlier concessions in addition to being Guatemala's single largest landowner it was also Guatemala's largest single employer two-thirds of Guatemala's population was involved in agriculture in some way as well so this whole pattern of land ownership huge land owners were a lot of land but not growing anything on it was contributing to all kinds of problems including poverty and malnutrition United Fruit Company in others claimed that they needed this additional uncultivated land of basically a backup in case of a major crop failure but their critics claim to that this uncultivated Surplus was way more than they could possibly ever need or bends his plan to fix this was decreed 900 which went into effect on June 27th 1952 landowners who had more than 600 acres of uncultivated land were required to sell it to the Guatemalan government in exchange for 25 year interest-bearing bonds the tax value of the land as of May 1952 was used to determine the selling price so smaller farms under 223 Acres were exempt from this and so we're Farms that were between 223 and 670 Acres that were at least two-thirds cultivated Farms that were fully coated they were all so unaffected no matter how large the farm was the terms of this law actually required are bends to relinquish some of his own land and someone else affected with Guillermo Toreo who became are benzos foreign minister government owned land used to grow coffee with also completely redistributed during this program as well the relinquish land would then be distributed to landless people in 42.5 acre plots either so they would own it outright or so that they would hold it for their lifetime in the latter case the land couldn't pass directly to their ears but their descendants would get preferential treatment what decisions were made about the land after their death people who owns the land outright would pay 5% of their annual crop value to the government and people who held it in a lifetime tenure would pay 3% that's law also established committees that people who thought they were entitled to land could petition and the committee will review their case and make a decision free case had to be decided within six weeks of submission which was totally different from operating under the more dictatorial government where you could ask for something and then it would just never happen or be addressed a subsequent law also established a national agrarian Bank to issue fixed rate loans to land recipients to help them get their Farm start wildest program was in effect 1.5 million acres of land were distributed to about 100,000 families in Guatemala this was probably between 20 and 25% of the people who were eligible the national agrarian bank and its newly established credit agency had approved more than 11 million dollars in loans and average of $225 per applicant in the fall of 1953 the Guatemalan Embassy reported that its corn production had increased by 15% rice by 72% and wheat by 21% with much of the increase attributed to the small farm started thanks to decree 900 head harder to track actually how this affected overall domestic crops and Sport Clips because this that's did not last very long this program didn't so it does seem like that like there were more crops that stayed in the country domestically and fewer crops that were exported for that first year but some of that was also accounted for because of weather that affected coffee production like it's a really complicated but overall it does seem like people were using with land for what it was supposed to be for which was growing crops for themselves in addition more than half of Guatemala's population was indigenous at this point with most but not all of them belonging to one of more than 20 different Maya group indigenous people made up the large majority of landless rural people so this program was returning land to Guatemala date of people for the first time since the Spanish Conquest as was the case with earlier new programs this wasn't perfect there were cases of people who wanted more land than they were allotted or who had not been allotted land commandeering land they weren't entitled to their were also overzealous committees that seems to want to settle the score after Decades of being exploited by large landowners who allotted more lamb than was really allowed and it does appear that Guatemala's Latino population receive disproportionately more land allotments than other ethnic groups over although this system gave previously planned with people the opportunity to try to become self-sufficient farmers and in 1954 the Guatemalan government also wrote out a literacy program in these same rural areas hoping to help the people who receive this land becomes better able to manage it themselves long-term two-thirds of the Lamb that was seized during all this belongs to United Fruit Company which felt like it was being unfairly tar invited for a 900 on top of that the payment that was offered to United Fruit was far less than the market value of the land source is reported it as either $630,000 or about a million dollars this was because the company had been artificially undervaluing its land for tax purposes and reported text value was what was being used to determine the payment nevertheless the US government on behalf of United Fruit Company demanded a much higher payment of 15.9 million so basically United fruit company with a problem they made for themselves in the situation like their loophole finally got discovered in caught and exploited by someone else not even explain it but like applied in another one and then it hurts yes so I have had been the case with so many of the array below administration's reforms the United States and United Fruit Company criticize this whole land efficient program as communism and let me clear this policy was influenced by Guatemala's Communist party which was called the Guatemalan Workers Party or PGT which lines up with how that translates into Spanish one of the advisors who had helped draft the create 900 was Jose Manuel fortuny who was are benzos friend and also the PGT General Secretary degree 900 also been passed with the support of the Communist party which are Benz had legalized after becoming president has maintained that the Communists presence in the Guatemalan government with small and that he himself was dedicated to capitalism and democracy one of the stated goals of decree 900 was to allow previously landless people to become part of the capitalist economy and to improve Guatemala's capitalist economy overall and it doesn't appear that the PGT had connections to the Soviet Union communism in Latin America at this point was more focused on a pending dictatorships and getting out from under four capitalist interests not Unbecoming Soviet allies yeah United States didn't really care about this Nuance regarding being a Soviet allied forces being influenced by communism now and then also complicating us perceptions of this law in February of 1953 the Guatemalan Supreme Court found what are the laws Provisions unconstitutional the law outline the dispute resolution process that ended with the president of the Republic instead of with the courts so when the supreme court ordered that the land redistribution stop until lower courts can hear the cases of land that had been allegedly expropriated illegally Congress impeach the judges that had made that ruling and their Replacements reversed the decision admittedly this was squirrelly critics of the United States point to it as evidence that are benzos Administration was really a totalitarian regime regardless in the midst of all of this United Fruit Company had started advocate for the US Central Intelligence Agency to overthrow the arbenz government and replace it with an Administration that would be more sensitive to American influence and United Fruit company's business I'll get to this whole CIA situation after a sponsor break technology is becoming more open data more accessible and the world more Innovative IBM is combining their industry expertise with the open source leadership of redhat to bring you more freedom for security more flexibility let's unlock the world's potential let's put smart to work learn more dye DM. Com red hat what was the back before the break that huge motivator for the CIA coup in Guatemala was the idea the Guatemala was that about to fall under a very Sinister communist influence and a huge source of that idea was publicist and propagandist Edward Bernays folks have asked Us The Duo episode on him we might at some point when folks first start asking one of our one of our other shows our Network had just sent us a little excessive to have liked that much on the same network but that was years ago now his relationship with United Fruit Company went back to about 1940 and it first he had been focused on trying to improve the company's image in the Latin American countries where it was operating because outside of the wealthy Elite that were benefiting the most from United Fruit Company presents people understandably did not have a very good opinion of it and called it a variety of disparaging nicknames including the octopus their name is really wasn't all that successful at shifting ordinary people's opinions of United Fruit Company in Central America but he was masterful at selling the idea that Guatemala was under an immediate communist threat to the United States for example he brought journalists to Guatemala to conduct interviews with a handpicked selection of United Fruit Company officials who talked to all about how the country was about to collapse under communism he had arranged the whole press junket in 1951 with all of the interviews arranged through the United Fruit Company did none of the people he arranged to come in they got all their opinions from United Fruit first attempts to overthrow the Guatemalan government took place in 1952 under the administration of President Harry Truman Truman Doctrine you might remember from part one it was known as operation fortune or operation PD Fortune because of the little prefix that goes of the beginnings of CIA code names of collaborating with Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza to arm a rebellion led by disgruntled General Carlos Castillo armas Castillo armas and try to lead a rebellion back in 1950 and after escaping from prison afterward he had become something of a folk hero the CIA when he was inaugurated as president of the United States on January 20th 1953 and the next day he appointed John Foster Dulles Secretary of State you don't remember that name from part one he was one of the people who help United Fruit Company negotiates multiple monopolies and other concessions in Guatemala during the 1930s while working for the company's Law Firm Sullivan & Cromwell this was one of many connections between United Fruit Company and high-placed figures in the US government Dulles has brother Allen Dulles was the director of the CIA between 1953 and 1961 and he had previously served on United fruits board of directors during the years that were talking about today Henry Cabot Lodge Jr was a senator from Massachusetts and then an ambassador to the United Nations the lodge family was a major investor and United Fruit Company and he was nicknamed the senator from United Fruit these are just examples so sometimes you'll see this whole thing framed as United Fruit Company got the CIA to overthrow the Guatemalan government the really the United States was operating under the idea that if one nation in a region became communist all of its neighbor should follow something Eisenhower described in terms of Southeast Asia in his domino theory speech the same year as the coup in Guatemala so without the supposed threat of Communism the CIA might not have gotten involved in Guatemala up and with the supposed threat of Communism the CIA probably would have gotten involved even if United Fruit Company had not been part of the equation it is totally fair to note that a lot of the paranoia about communism in Guatemala was coming from public relations operations paid for by United Fruit though yeah Jose Manuel Fortuna later said they would have overthrown us even if we had grown No Bananas which I think is accurate for the CIA operation to orchestrate a coup in Guatemala was authorized in August of 1953 that was codenamed Operation success or operation pbsuccess and it was led by Colonel Albert Haney the idea was to create what looked like an uprising from within Guatemala but with the uprising really being organized and directed by the CIA with a fighting force that the CIA recruited and trained mostly from Guatemalans living in Exile in Nicaragua the CIA established a dummy company to supply weapons to the supposed Liberation Army a dummy charitable Foundation was also established to donate aircraft for a Liberation Air Force also organized by the CIA and flown by American pilots and anti-government radio station call the voice of Liberation started broadcasting propaganda and disinformation reinforcing the idea that there was a huge popular Uprising in the worst prom inside of Guatemala basically psychological warfare the voice of Liberation broadcast claimed to be transmitting from a secret location in Guatemala but the only time it was actually doing that it was broadcasting from inside the US Embassy most of the time the signals were really coming from Nicaragua and occasionally from Dominican Republic or from Honduras several of these other governments were also opposed to the Arby's Administration both because of the reforms that he was rolling out which sort of threatened the elite elsewhere and also because he welcomed exiled revolutionaries from these other countries into Guatemala the CIA once again shows Carlos Castillo armas as the leader of this Uprising they sneaked him into Florida to meet with CIA Western Hemisphere Chief JC King where they went over the plan and what they expected in return basically that Castillo armas return all of the land that United Fruit Company had surrendered and rollback other policies from the our beds and I have a low administrations in January 1854 a Panamanian career informed our bands of this plot including handing over a bunch of Liberation Army documents on January 29th Guatemala newspapers started publishing a lot of this material and at this point the United States denied all involvement and called the reports ridiculous and untrue but in reality the United States was just waiting for a clear reason to start their Invasion that whole progression of foreign policy that we talked about in part one had led up to the idea that members of the organization of American states could interfere in other's Affairs if it was under the threat of quote communism or any totalitarian Doctrine to cover its bases the US needed evidence of that threat me while the 10th inter-american Conference was held in Caracas Venezuela in March of 1954 on March 28th the conference adopted the Caracas Declaration of solidarity which condemns quote activities of the internet no communist movement as constituting intervention in American Affairs it also declared quote that the domination or control of the political institutions of any American state by the international communist movement extending to this hemisphere the political system of an extra Continental power would constitute a threat to the sovereignty and political Independence of the American states endangering the Peace of America and we call for a meeting of consultation to consider the adoption of appropriate action in accordance with existing treaties this declaration was intended to single out Guatemala but without naming Guatemala and of the nations in attendance Guatemala was the only one to vote against it to the US this confirmed that Communists had taken control of Guatemala but it still wasn't evidence of an actual threat then on May 15th 1954 a shipment of arms arrived in Guatemala including rifles ammunition artillery and anti-tank Weaponry they have been purchased from Czechoslovakia which was a communist country and part of the Soviet Bloc Guatemala had previously tried to buy arms from the United States which had refused under the grounds that Guatemala had not signed the Rio security pact of 1947 from their Guatemala had tried to buy weapons from several other countries as well all of them had refused some of which under heavy pressure from the United States to do so there were figures in Guatemala who felt like the US didn't pressure Czechoslovakia in to say no because they were hoping for this kind of evidence basically though Guatemala had gone to Czechoslovakia as a last resort us intelligence had learned about the potential deal in 1953 but allowed it to go forward hoping to intercept the shipment on Route and use it as evidence of Soviet collusion part of that plan involves using the shipment as evidence that are Benz was arming a militia to fight against the Guatemalan Army has maintained that he was just resupplying the Guatemalan Army but the United States sided this as proof that the Soviet Union was propping up a Communist Regime but the US did not successfully intercept this shipment on the way if they had hoped it basically lost track of it but also these weapons weren't that useful once they arrived in Guatemala a lot of their rifles didn't work there were not any tanks in Central America Freddy's anti-tank weapons to be used against the artillery pieces needed an extensive network of improved roads to really be useful and Guatemala didn't really how about at this point that really mattered the fact that it had come from Czechoslovakia was the evidence that the United States wanted to justify this to it we're going to talk about how all of this is finally played out after we pause for another sponsor break let me tell you about Pete Who Loved hockey and always wanted to play in the NHL feed played since he was three and begged his mom to let him stay on the ice by some nights he even slept in his hockey skates Pete practiced and practiced I'm to Monday when he was 47 beat realized he just wasn't that good so he threw his skates in the trash but then he heard how Geico proud partner of the NHL good save him money on car insurance so he switched and saved a bunch so it all worked out the United States stepped up this operation on May 17th with Eisenhower blockade in Guatemala and The Liberation Army organizing from Honduras uses where their base of operations United Fruit Company company town flyovers for that on May 26th with planes dropping leaflets War sing the Guatemalan public of these supposed secret plans and encouraging the Guatemalan military to turn on the president the voice of Liberation broadcast false reports about an increasingly large army of rebels that was taking on new recruits as it moved our business has put a stop to The Liberation Army's organization within its borders and the United States started using the pretext of sending military aid to Honduras and Mexico two weapons for this manufactured Uprising by early June the cia's ongoing efforts to destabilize the Guatemalan government had led to increasing unrest including plots against the government from within on June 3rd Military Officers tried to convince our bands that for the good of the country he should Purge all Communists from his administration but he refused 5 days later are been suspended civil liberties citing the National Emergency throughout all of this government officials and the media and the United States were warning of an Insidious communist threat in Guatemala with John Foster Dulles calling the Guatemalan government a quote communist type reign of terror the actual Invasion began on June 18th 1954 after all the ongoing propaganda efforts the CIA was expecting the Guatemalan people to rise up inside with the invasion but that didn't really happen The Liberation Army face repeated defeats three additional aircraft were deployed to provide more air support the two of them were shot down artist placed the Army and the police on alert but he didn't actually deploy them he was afraid that if he did it would just look like the US propaganda was right about what was happening in Guatemala foreign minister gyro Toreo recommended the Guatemala go through formal channels to address this he met with John peripherally who is the u.s. ambassador to Guatemala do of course knew exactly what was going on he also contacted the UN Security Council and the inter-american peace committee of the organization of American states for support Toyo the noun Stewie accusations that Guatemala had become a communist country and ask for a ceasefire and 400 and Nicaraguan forces to be removed from Guatemala on the 19th the US planes flying over Guatemala progressed from dropping leaflets to also strafing and dropping bombs on Guatemalan buildings including gas and oil storage Depots could respond all of its planes have been before 1936 and are benzo ultimately grounded them out of concerns over whether the pilots were still loyal to him on that night of the 19th or Ben's gave a radio address, what was happening an armed Invasion and it he said quote are only crime consisted of decreeing our own laws and applying them to all without exception our crime is having an active and agrarian reform which affected the interests of the United Fruit Company are crime is wanting to have our own route to the Atlantic our own electric power and our own docs and ports are crime is our patriotic wish to advance to progress to win economic independence to match our political independent we are condemned because we have given our present population land and writes the air attacks continued ever been declared martial law on June 20th Guatemala continue to appealing to the United Nations for Aid or Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge whose family owned stock United Fruit was head of the security Council after a lengthy debate the UN Security Council determined that this was a matter for the organization of American states which as we noted earlier was heavily influenced by the United States the Soviet Union voted against this correctly concluding that the US was involved in what was happening in Guatemala after days of bombings and attacks and going propaganda both within and outside of Guatemala the United States started publicly supporting caste alarm off of The Liberation Army the voice of Liberation started broadcasting reports of all kinds of successful attacks by The Liberation Army which weren't actually happening but also reported that Castillo are mosses force was growing at an astounding rate even though he was in command of about 400 people at the most the international news media also picked up these stories and reported then it's back in the midst of all of this an American plane bombed a British writer at the request of Nicaragua which claimed it was carrying gasoline to refuel are benzos military it turned out to be carrying only bananas and cotton and the CIA paid off its ensure as it became clear that the United States was backing Castillo armas in The Liberation Army a wave of anti-American sentiment started to grow within and outside of Guatemala including in numerous nations in Central and South America and the Caribbean Argentinian revolutionary Che Guevara ahead travel to Guatemala to see the ongoing reforms that were going on there and he was actually there when this Q took place his first wife Hilda gang leader said quote it was Guatemala which finally convinced him of the necessity for armed struggle and for taking the initiative against imperialism by June 25th arbenz was losing the support of the Guatemalan military he recognized that there was no way he could go up against the United States directly he resigned on June 27th and His Radio address announcing this are bones pointed out the roles of the United States and the United Fruit Company in all of this saying quote I took over the presidency with great faith in the democratic system in Liberty and in the possibility of achieving economic independence for Guatemala I continue to believe that this program is just I have not violated my faith in Democratic Liberties in the independence of Guatemala and in all the good witch is the future of humanity one day the obscured forces which today oppress the backward and Colonial world will be defeated I will continue to be despite everything a fighter for the liberty and progress of my country he took refuge in the Mexican embassy from there he was offered refuge in Czechoslovakia and then he traveled to several other countries before returning to Mexico and dying there in 1971 or benz's speech was a totally different tone from the one that was delivered by US Secretary of State Dallas on June 30th of 1954 and that speech that in part quote who's the evil purpose of the Kremlin to destroy the inter-american system and they test the ability of the American states to maintain the peaceful Integrity of this hemisphere for several years now International communism has been probing here and there for nesting places in the Americas it finally chose Guatemala as a spot which it could turn into an official base from which to breed subversion which would extend to the other American republics this intrusion of Soviet despotism was of course a direct challenge to the Monroe Doctrine the first and most fundamental of our foreign policies later in the same speed Stella said quote it was not the power of the arbenz government that concerned us but the power behind it if World communism captured any American state however small and knew you and perilous front and established which will increase the danger is of the entire free world and require even greater sacrifices from the American people there is continued to be debate about exactly what role communism played parabens administration at the time the Guatemalan Workers Party was the nation's smallest political party and the number of Communist party members in the Guatemalan government was also small for example of the 56 members of Congress four of them were communist at the same time several of those positions were particularly influential including the president's personal secretary and the president of Congress there were also members of the party in prominent positions outside of the government including some of Guatemala's largest labor unions regardless though what was happening in Guatemala doesn't really aligned with the propaganda that became part of the justification for this intervention when he stepped down our been handed over power to Colonel Carlos Enrique Diaz he was chief of the Guatemalan armed forces of the Republic vs became part of a three-man ruling junto with Diaz announcing that he was committed to continuing his predecessor's work to the CIA started trying to figure out how to remove him from power as well ultimately dispute arose among the center which was been replaced with a whole different three-man team it was a very chaotic few days this team travel to El Salvador to negotiate a peace with Castillo armas you ultimately became the next president of Guatemala communism and promised that he would not roll back the social gains of the previous administration that on October 10th 1954 he was elected president while running unopposed once he was in power here appealed the 1945 Constitution he abolished the previous administrations land reforms returning all the expropriated land back to the United Fruit Company and other landowners Heroes back to the earlier expansions of voting rights and He restored the Catholic church is right to own property and teach religion in public schools Castillo armas also outlawed labor organization and political parties in restored Jorge has chief of secret police to his former position 7 prominent labor organizers were also murdered on July 1st at the United States request Castillo armas also established a National Committee of defense against communism in Guatemala in 1958 Castillo armas was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards his successor was General Miguel laderas Fuentes a rebellion to overthrow his dictatorial regime in 1960 with the start of the Guatemalan Civil War which lasted for 36 years and spite of the ongoing civil rights abuses of the Fuentes Virginia and his predecessor cut the alarm and the abuses of the Guatemalan military the United States backed the military through this Civil War through varying degrees through the various presidential administrations that were in power during the 36 years that it went on of it being acceptable to intervene and American nation's Affairs if there's a threat with or without a communist or authoritarian influence the United States made it a policy for decades to back these kinds of dictatorial regimes regardless of their human or civil rights record as long as those regimes were anti-communist more than 200,000 people were killed during the Guatemalan Civil War and that is in a country with a population of only about 10 million at the end of the war according to a 1999 United Nations historical clarification commission 83% of those killed were indigenous Maya killed at the hands of the Guatemalan military or militia which were being supported supplied and trained by the United States even though the war officially ended in 1996 violence and instability continue to be issues in Guatemala today President Bill Clinton was in Guatemala not long after this historical clarification Commission report was published and said quote is important that I States clearly that support for military horses or intelligence units which engaged and violent and widespread repression of the kind described in the report was wrong and the United States must not repeat that mistake we must and we will instead continue to support the peace and Reconciliation process in Guatemala Guatemalan president of Otto colome offered his own statement in 2011 saying quote that day changed Guatemala and we have not recuperated from it yet it was a crime to Guatemalan society and it was an act of aggression to a government starting its Democratic spring the ongoing economic social and political issues affecting Guatemala today are a direct result of all of this and like we said in various points in the show this kind of us intervention was not you need to Guatemala especially during the Cold War when the u.s. made numerous other interventions in other Latin American countries as well including providing weapons training and other sport to dictatorial regimes and what was unique though to Guam what was the directions scope and overall success of all these reforms before the Us intervened and other words the migrant crisis that is currently happening at the United States Southern border is directly connected to Decades of us interventions in Latin America including this one also United Fruit Company went through an antitrust suit and ultimately sold its land in Guatemala to Del Monte after a couple of corporate transitions United Fruit Company is now Chiquita Brands International the company's history page traces its roots back to United Fruit Company but the timeline of its history on the company's website skip the 1950s entirely few years ago there was a stuff you should know live show that was about the history of not the history was about how public relations work I think it's what they called it and I saw that live show here and when they mentioned to keita sand people cheered trash Clark with like you're going to want to take that back if you don't know any of this history everybody loves the banana you know what I mean like a real as a little cartoon banana lady I understand that impulse but it is made without the full picture absolutely yeah because the next thing that they talked about was this whole overthrow of the Guatemalan government at the hands of the United States Central Intelligence Agency really influence but definitely strongly advocated for by United fruit company whose policies for the start of the land reforms but got everybody's attention anyway that's not the most fun episode that is important information but I'm hoping you have maybe slightly more delightful listener mail it does not hurt back to a more fun episode but it's content is up is interesting and and cool so Lauren writes dear Tracy and Holly I just wanted to write and say thank you for your awesome podcast I love the quality and variety of shows and your excellent presentation style and I've recommended you to a lot of my friends I was really interested in your recent the little mermaid shows I'm a medical historian and was previously a curator of a medical Museum where I cared for a large collection of disability Prosthetics we were working with Lester University to discuss how we could better work with the disabled community service represent their stories not just approached the collection from medical model of disability as part of a project we hosted a performance of Cabinet of Curiosities how disability was kept in a box which was developed by the wonderful artist and actor Matt Fraser who has the little Mite induced book Amelia not work with medical museums in the UK to explore the disability history of which he brought out in the performance there's a performance available on the museum association website Lauren gets is the length and it's well worth a watch it is such a wonderful piece but the one part which struck me was the video not shared of a child he was put in a pair of gas-powered prosthetic legs and arms that about 53 minutes in the performance and the vulnerability of placing this young person and such a device it really caused me to question how I interpreted such prosthetic devices for audiences in the museum obviously there were people who Thrive and rely on Prosthetics however the medical model of disability attempting to fix people can also create new problems if you stay the course and your show which is great to hear I just thought you guys might find the show interesting thank you both again for such a great podcast I'll be continuing to listen and welcome Auntie future medical shows in the future with very best wishes Lauren thank you so much for this email Lauren I have not had the chance to watch this whole video yet but we are going to put it into the show notes for folks who may be interested to be able to check it out thank you so much for sending it and for sending this email I love to hear from Museum curators and other people who is working balls similarly to what we do attempting to put historical things in the context for the general public yes I also love Matt Fraser I was introduced to him he was on the season of American Horror Story that is called freak Show and it was amazing and then I was like I want to see everything he does because he's such a good actor so I'm glad that he's getting a little more love I watch that season of American Horror Story and I did not connect the person in the name even having started to watch the video I didn't put it all together so thank you Lauren in spite of the various iPads that seems to be written like every couple or three weeks and start floating around Twitter historians are doing a lot of work engaging with the public everybody hands and Museum curators and archivists in all kinds of folks you're thinking about writing an op-ed about how historians are engaging with the public may be like Google that re-read the things that people have already said about it and then the many responses about how that's not actually all that accurate I think some of that too is if people have one idea of what a historian is in their head and they think it's that person isn't somehow in the public eye that historians aren't out there to in the work we have an upcoming interview that I'm hoping will help dispel said oh nice I'm very happy about that yeah Holly's in my work is deeply reliant on the work of historians who are putting things out for the public all the time yes so you would like to write to us is there any other
