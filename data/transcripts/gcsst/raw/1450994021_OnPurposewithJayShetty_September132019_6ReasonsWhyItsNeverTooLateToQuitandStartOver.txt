what would my younger self decide that I stopped doing isn't that I stop playing instrument is that I stop playing a sport is it that I stopped being entrepreneurial is it that I stopping risk-taking what is it to me when I ask a question it was that I stopped using words to express my feelings I stopped sharing that with the world because I loved writing when I grew up I love poetry spoken word I stopped using words in that way hey everyone welcome back to on purpose the number one Health podcast in the world thanks to each and every single one of you I'm genuinely so happy and so grateful that you listening every single week to learn to grow and to invest in your mindset to invest in your happiness to invest in your Droid and I love seeing the messages that show me that you leave these sessions feeling that join your life that you live these sessions feeling equipped feeling focused feeling Direction in your life. That's all I'm trying to do is I'm just trying to facilitate growth trying to facilitate you to have the resources to make the changes and the difference that you're sitting in your life it means so much to me that you were here right now whether you're walking your dog with your commuting whatever you're up to and that you were so fascinated to learn the six reasons why it's never too late to quit something and start doing what you love now here's where we kind of cat it all wrong is where it starts to get complicated than mine so when made to feel that we need to have our lives figured out by 21 how many have you been in that position nod your head Raise Your Hands Say Yes out loud how many of you being in that position would you felt when you were Twenty-One that you needed to have your life figured out you needed to know what job you were going to do you needed to know how and where you were going to live you needed to know so many things it was so much pressure around that age or whatever age you graduated and that's the thing it's usually the graduate college or maybe we stopped working and it's crazy that we expect people to know themselves know what they want to do and start doing it like it's actually a ridiculous notion that the education system cardi as it stands which is teaching us subjects not really teaching us patents not really teaching our problem solving not really teaching us the management of emotional well-being and intelligence what we're reliving toy subjects were really being tall is retention what we're really being taught is a better connection application or experimentation without being towards self-awareness these will be super useful skills to be able to be clear by Twenty One about what we want to do but we've never had that so to put this false expectation on ourself to have everything figured out by Twenty One actually seems highly unrealistic it's actually absurd based on the fact that we would 21 or 25 or even Thirty we've had very few experiences that we've been exposed to to actually make a valuable decision and that's why it's never 2 need to start anything you want to do because we always made to decide to write this pressure to figure things out early and because it is too early we recognize that we need more time and we can find that more time it makes a huge difference in our life so this is kind of course it's slightly different for each and everyone of us but I see these Trends so in our twenties we think we have to commit to a job start working hard because it seems like the auto thing to do and at that time we really needed to do was the opportunity to explore experiment to try new things and learn about ourselves now in the traditional way of kind of how it works is we do what what to expect to not twenties we work hard we commit to a job you know we start realizing wait a minute I actually didn't get to explore anything I didn't get to learn anything like I have different passions with him and I don't understand myself and gotobus arthritis is when we start takes no tentative route so that eases when we start trying out new and different things now if we had used R22 experiment then I said he's our time we can get in the Groove Get In the Zone and stop focusing noticed how different it is when you have time to figure yourself out when you have time to learn about yourself and you have time to grow notice how different it is right it it's just a completely different experience and I'm fascinated by that because I think so many of us miss out right so many of us miss out on these opportunities for a lot of us than we really start exploring at the age of 40 50 60 70 whatever maybe for you at the age of 30 that's when you start exploring learning about yourself self-awareness your passions your purpose and it's funny show me Mustang that's late so many of us think that's behind so many Mustang we came late to the party I speak to so many 30 40 50 year olds who say I wish I started anyone the truth is of course if that makes sense doesn't make sense is to quit now what doesn't make sense is enough finally having this realization and saying when it's too late too late for what too late for who who made up these rules this is a question I ask myself all the time whenever I hear something is too late too early you don't know who made these rules who made these norms and these Norms really govern so many decisions in our life and what we decide to do with our life and they really did Belletetes us that's what I noticed about Norms Norms actually debilitating because we start comparing yourself against the average if you compare yourself against the average you become more average that's what you're comparing yourself against but if you compare yourself against you I want to live my passion I want to do what I love and grow that's what really makes the difference right that's what's really going to have the experience so what I wanted to share here is that there are things that we're better off doing when we younger like learning a language language and I'm sure you can think of some things now that you like yeah you know what I picked up at that time I'm not sure I can pick it up now maybe is riding a bike ride it was easy to pick up when you were younger but there are a few things that we're easier to pick up when you young the interesting thing is that actually science shows that there are plenty of things that we actually pick up as we get older and this would be fascinated me when I read this Business Insider article talking about how the study show how we actually perform better in specific strength at different times in our life so it was really interesting for me to see in that same article that people between the ages of 82 and 85 reported the highest psychological well-being right Nobel Prize winners are more likely to make that big Discovery at 40 right 40 years old and so many of us are you not wanting to be published by 30 and all this kind of stuff but things happen a bit later and there were a few more here that I want to share with you Jesus quote from Muhammad Ali that frame to

and feelings in our forties and fifties that's a huge huge thing I mean whether it's business whether its content weather rates and palmon whatever it may be understanding people's emotions and being able to communicate with them being able to connect with them if you're only really getting good at that in your forties and fifties of course we can accelerate to that's great but the point being that there's a lot of things that we actually go and we think we go right so this is some this is really interesting stuff for me because I'm just like I kind of think like always I didn't do it when I was young then it's really hard now and actually did the opposite is true that actually if you don't as time goes by your learning a lot more I want to share with you in this podcast is the six reasons why it's never too late to quit but you don't want to do and start doing what you do want to do because I don't want you to give up and I'll tell you the biggest reason why don't we need to give up I mean this when I say like a really mean it I genuinely believe that you are summoned off the world how do I know that how am I sure of that because off to spending time with thousands of people off to listening and hearing from so many people I have seen that even people we underestimate I have seen that even people that we didn't expect big things from I have seen that even people that have underestimated you for years we had surprised all the time to think about someone from your school that you didn't think was going to do anything right that you didn't think was going to make it but made it is it someone from your school some of that you started with maybe even in elementary school or high school who was there in your life that you kind of wrote off but then they grew up in surprise you just have fascinate-u fascinates me I know that they were people in my school though wanted to break in a music and people would never believe that they would break into music I guess what they broke into music and it was the same for every other field and there was so many things like that so many people like that that actually and gather their life experience and I actually get to where they want to later on in life so often there's no there's no clues or there's no understanding when people are young and you see that happened off to its it take to take a think about that take a walk down memory lane like if there's a person in school and you might mind and recognized that success isn't just you know I think we live in a culture right now where you have like so and so became a billionaire in 21 and 10030 or whatever it may be in that kind of pause on this pressure that everything's happening earlier and the truth is that everything would happen to the right time for you and you were ready when you are focused on your work anybody when you're obsessed about it when you are committed to it that's already won the six reasons to get you started I really want the six reasons to get you going and I really want you to realize that I believe you have something to offer and I believe that you have it inside of you even if it's hidden away and you can't see it but I want you to see it at least six reasons going to help you unearth it so that you actually gain more confidence as well these are the six that I wanted to share with you so the number one listened carefully the number one reason why it's never too late to start doing some of that you love is plenty of people started late we have this assumption like I was just saying that everyone started early and in an article by Richard feloni in Business Insider he talks about 20 people who became highly successful after age 40 now there's tons of these lists but I took a few from this one that really stood out to me the article you mentioned Stanley who created Marvel age of 39 Vera Wang who's a figure skater journalist before moving in 40 now that's mine language do you think you know I'm a figure skater and a journalist people like Julia Child and Martha Stewart and the list goes on and on and on and the point is that plenty of people have reason to Heights later in their life and you can too it's so easy to make the excuse to write yourself off that it's too late it's not going to happen for you anymore there enough obstacles in the way things are only getting more complicated no one's going to care about me as I get out of whatever it is any excuses that go in your mind and it's just so so important and so so powerful for you to recognize that so many people in the world owed didn't start as early as you think they did and that's really what it is it's a mindset to perception if you keep telling yourself it's too late guess what it's too late if you recognize that actually amazing thing to happen to me and for all the people so many things start to change so I really really want you to reflect on that point and I want you to find the stories of people that inspire you who started late so you can remind yourself of them whenever that excuse comes to mind and that's what you really want to do if you can picture the stories the response the attitude other people and how they dealt with your excuses how they got through them then you can she bring them to the floor of your mind when it happens for you so I really really want you to think about that now number two this is a huge one you have more expense today than you did yesterday you Liza you're smarter you've been through more you've had more experiences you're better at reading energies you want two people from different backgrounds you know how to deal with more this will make you will help you make better decisions and I think we forget that we look at time as a resource a time you know time is a resource that we can get back you can buy it you can't loan it you can borrow it but guess what maybe it's not about time maybe that time and she made you wise and maybe made you strong maybe it made you smarter and you've been able to develop so much so strongly and you're just putting out a side for time right now so we don't need measuring one thing so when will it burn when measuring like all I could have started idea what we're doing is measuring time when measuring the fact that hey what about my knowledge what a my skills what are my strengths what about my abilities all of that has changed and we just ignore that I think it's so important to recognize that you have more experience today you're more to bring to the table today you've more to grow it today than you did yesterday and that's all going to help you if you recognize it as if you just think oh yeah it's useless because it's late then you forget that I want you to do right now and I mean this I want you to write down all the strength you have the expense to have all the strengths that you have that you believe are going to be useful to you anything that you learned from your job anything you've learned over the years write down at least three strands and I want you to write this down I mean this I want you to write this down right now I need to write down three stents and if you can write down three I want to write down 10 right you can write down three but if you write down three I want you to write down 10 I'll tell you why we are not aware of our instruments we constantly focus on our weaknesses and amplify them we constant get distracted by that which would not good at rather than that which we excel at and I can't stress enough how easy it is to forget your strengths and start focusing on your weaknesses when we actually to focus on our strengths and slowly develop our weaknesses no make sure you done that right I'm being serious make sure you've done that makes you written down those three strengths that you have that you've developed that you've learned over time that you know are going to be useful in this the Practical piece of advice you may not think you have transferable skills but believe me you do now I'll give an example of this in my own life when I started my first job I was 26 years old because it is among of course and then took me a while to find a job when I said I was 26 years old not 21 so by that account I was late by 5 years which at the beginning of the difference as you grow older in your career makes less of a difference because everyone grows their experience but for me that was a pretty big deal now I feel a stye the same fear I was just like oh my God I'm late on his younger than me to get more time to got more energy than hey they don't have more experience and guess what I had to try and find the transferable skills of them that was harder than just like I've got some skills like I have self-awareness I have the ability to manage stress and pressure what else do I have from living as much as the value of discipline and focus what else do I have I love researching and I love teaching and I love you honey and I love presenting so I started focusing on all those things and slowly forgot that I didn't have any of the challenges anymore because I start to realize that I had more experience and I had to play to that strength right I want you to play to that strength rather than me sitting there worrying about everything I didn't have to focus on when I did have that made a huge difference to me in the corporate world as I transitioned into that space and I really think it will for you as well now the number three point that I want to share with you is this just like you have more experience today you have a brother Network today right you can actually ask people how to do things take their recommendations and learn from the actual experience right you think of 18 or 21 or 25 or 30 or whatever it is they sell five years ago you knew less people you knew less people who could actually help you you probably need less people in there is that you can about and as time went on you started to find these people and these people started become your friends so you decide to become friends of friends I guess what you didn't have the access before that means you waste less time that Isis mean you learn quicker that means that you no longer have to live in this world where you are thinking of something is right for you you cannot use this is how I'd like you to think about it I'd love for you right now to write down three people in your network and they could be first degree 2nd degree connections 1st 2nd degree is people that you know that know people that you want to know why don't we people that you love to learn about three people careers that you intrigued about and I want you to go and set up meeting so I want you to do this right now when you drive down at three people and I want to set up meetings with those people with no agenda perform to learn about what they do because if you start saying it's too late but it's not too late because you know more people more people means more access my taxes means more opportunities more opportunities means a potential transition and we're so quick to write off but actually we have the biggest strength sitting right there in our pockets right sitting right there he's in our lives and that is our Network and we you know we know this we really really know this is if your network is your net worth and might and you know this isn't even a financial thing it's just recognizing that it's never too late because you actually have access to more people that's what I'd love for you to do is not just sit down and talk to them you could go and Shadow someone right you could interview someone and get to know them you could ask them about that actually is you more likely to know people in roles that you're actually interested now than when you first started out and you didn't know anyone in the wrong so really think about in your network connections a you want to meet with and I want you to schedule as meetings this week and I'm not I'm not messing around I want you to schedule these meetings this week might take advantage of that amazing Network principal number for this applies to some people may not apply to everyone but I do think it's important to throw out there for all of you listening that it's never too late to start because you might actually be in a better place financially when you first started work can you be scared because you like I need to living I need to pay my rent and now maybe there is some system has you save some money in the bank and this applies to you may want to save money before taking a break and this is what I found like my friends who were working in the city or in the corporate world if you experimented for years and it didn't go right you can walk straight back into a career without it being affected over three months over six months of a 9 months or actually for 12 months and if you don't take this test or experiment okay you want to come back to your career one year behind but it's not one you're worth it because what if you came back and you're actually light years ahead by what if it actually made the biggest difference in your life so you can literally take a break 3 6 9 12 months and come back and nothing would change and if you're not in that position you could save to make that change and see how it can happen. That's something that only happens later on in life to actually have that flexibility rights that something to try okay and number five this is more of a philosophical statement or erythropoiesis my statement that time becomes more valuable and you appreciate more so it's never too late to quit because you realize how valuable time is this time goes and you realize how much time you've wasted and how much you could use it more wisely and I really want you to think about that point because that should motivate you that it's never too late. I'm so valuable it is a matter of you figured out now it's just important that you have time to figure it out right you have the time you still have time it's not all disappeared it's normal gone away so you can start here you can start right now complaint number 6 this is why it's never too late to stop because if something's that important to you it shouldn't have a deadline if it's been on your mind for a few months a few years it's real trusted don't just get distracted don't just make excuses don't just tell yourself it's too late because that makes you feel safe from failure if it saves you from your fears because guess what then you have to face the ultimate fear of never having tried which is so much more painful quite a few years ago this is what I did I really help me I ask myself what would my youngest self be sad that I've stopped doing what did I used to do when I was younger that my youngest self would be sad now that I'm older that I've stopped doing and when ions that question I want you to write down your answer that question. What do you think about Anna and this is how a question meditation works I want you to ask that question really sincerely really deeply really genuinely to yourself and wait for the answer to come to you in a day in a week right in a day or a week later on to come to you and write down that on Sand see how it evolved everyday keep on asking the question genuine but genuinely the question and saying what would my younger self be sad that I stopped doing isn't that I stop playing instrument is there a stop playing a sport is it that I stopped being entrepreneurial is it stopping risk-taking what is it to me when I ask a question it was that I stopped using words to express my feelings I stopped sharing that with the world because I love writing when I grew up I love poetry I love spoken word I stopped using words in that way and then I asked myself the second question I want you to answer as well if you were on a fast forward to be 90 years old on your deathbed 100 years old on your deathbed and ask yourself what would you regret that you didn't do and again I want you to ask that question deeply and in a day or we keep a real asking a question of finding balance and write it down when I lost a question to myself my answer was that I'll regret if I never tried to share wisdom inaccessible relevant and practical way that I never tried to give people what I've learned and what I gained from my amazing teachers coaches and mentors and so I said to myself I said okay now that me to get these two questions the first question it uses the past Temple of the present whatever you didn't do whatever you don't do anymore that you did in the past and you could do it again now you using the past and the present because guess what no matter wants you get to that question you can start doing that now so if you like my younger self will be sad that I stop playing an instrument you can play that instrument now she's empowered the present from the past if you say world my younger self be sad that I stopped doing right now and you answers writing guess what you can do that right now you just empowered your present with your past and with the second question Austin yourself about what you do draft on your deathbed that you didn't do well in that case you use me future to empower the present because in the future if you're feeding all I didn't do this guess what it's not the future yet which means you can do it now set both those questions use the past and the future to empower the present because that's where everything happens and I want you to know that that no matter how late you think it is no matter how you feel you've wasted time the time is now and the present is powerful the present is the most powerful and you can change anything you can change your experience of the past and the future by what you do right now so this is how and why there are six reasons why it's never too late to quit while you don't like doing and start doing what you love because number one plenty of people started late number to you have more experience today than you did yesterday number three you have a big and network that you can ask for help number for you might be in a better place financially or you can train to be number five you realize how valuable time is and number six if it's that important to you it shouldn't a deadline passes but you empowered powered up focused and driven to make a change in your life it's not too late get started today and thank you so much for listening to on purpose I'll see you soon thank you so much for listening through to the end of that episode going to share this all across social media let people know that you're subscribed to unpublish let me know post it tell me what a difference it's making in your life I would love to see your thoughts I can't wait for this incredibly conscious Community wear creating of purposeful people you're now a part of the tribe a part of the squad thanks for being here I can't wait to share the next episode with you
