Org podcast that's Doctors Without Borders. Org podcast answers continues once again for me inside we've gathered some of the top Authorities on Criminal Justice Reform for discussion inside the walls of New York's Sing Sing Correctional Facilityobviously your best day was getting out of prison what was the lowest day every time I think about that sell like so many other people I'd heard about Criminal Justice Reform it over the last couple of years I've done story after story after story that is really open up my eyes in a different way it's an American crisis show me like 2.3 million people behind bars right now that's works out I'm told to buy one and every 37 people exploding in the early seventies with the War on Drugs mandatory minimum sentences and a tough on crime policies of both parties we have become the most punitive Society in the world we have the highest rate of incarceration in the world the rate of incarceration this country you look at bat against a charge against NATO countries you have to look at the numbers and understand this isn't working it affects families the economy and disproportionately the people of color I remembered my days as a street reporter in Chicago talking to Kids II would say you know my only choices I'm either going to end up dead or in prison so it to ourselves to create a kind of society were humans have the ability to stand back up but kind of society where there really is justice for all tell everyone is welcome to Sing Sing Correctional Facility we're about 30 miles north of New York city is close as you'll ever come to being in prison but you're more than 2 million Americans Life Behind Bars is a daily reality in the last hour you so is reporting from inside Louisiana is Angola prison over the next hour here it seems sick will be talking to some of the key people making a difference on this issue experts officials victims of crime and Men incarcerated parent sing sing this country watch people up at a rate greater than any country on Earth especially people of color is called mass incarceration and it comes at a terrible cost in dollars at a human lives we've seen this problem grow into an American prices in our lifetimes it's a story I return to again and again today here in sing-sing will focus and how we got here we've learned out together we can make things better among our guests today award-winning singer-songwriter John Legend it was made Criminal Justice Reform a personal Crusade you'll be joining us shortly as well former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and others but let's start by welcoming the founder and executive director of the Equal justice initiative Ryan Stevenson Brian great to see it I want to I want to start off with a chart with all too well 1972 fewer than 300,000 people are locked up in our prisons you look at that try to take Mount Everest going to the 2016 1 and 1/2 Mi by the way those sitting in in jails local jails how did we get here well it's first important to acknowledge that throughout most of the twentieth century we were pretty stable that number remained under 250,000 and then in the 1970s I think we were captured by what I call the politics of fear and anger elected officials began using rhetoric of fear and anger and directing it towards people who were drug addicted and Drug dependent and instead of saying that people who are addicted independent need our Healthcare System to respond at a health issue we said that a criminal justice issue and we declare this misguided War on Drugs and we put hundreds of thousands of P who in jails and prisons for drug-related offenses many of them non violent crime drops actually it's not true that the incarceration boom correlates with crime going out actually began that increasing the jails and prisons populations in the 1970s and early 1980s the crime rate went up it actually Pete in the early nineties when we had already tripled the number people in jails and prisons at what time it is in fact on crime is actually other factors the economy Social Services there's no question that we live in a violent Society but you can actually say we're actually helping to control Violence by putting so many people in jails and prisons people who are not even consider to be a threat to others and in fact I actually think mass incarceration has made us less say we've actually spent 80 billion dollars on jails and prisons when we could have spent some of that money on creating programs that actually help people avoid offending in the first but every time I wrestled with it in Angola what is the purpose of prison is it punishment is it retribution is Rehabilitation mostly it's about safety right and the problem is is that we've gone through an era where are politicians and elected officials and judges and prosecutors in too many people in law enforcement only think they're punishing cry we can't send crimes to prison we send people to prison we can't punish a cry we have to punish a person when you're only thinking about the crime it's easy to say death penalty life in prison without parole 50 years a hundred years 300 years but crime so in time people do when you start thinking about the people you realize it's more complicated I believe in accountability I hate violence I don't want to create I want to create policies that protect us I want to intervene when people are threat to other people I want to intervene when people talk to themselves but I also believe in Redemption I believe in restoration I believe in reconciliation I believe in Rehabilitation I Believe In fairness abrita mercy and I believe in Justice and we have a system that has no room for that and that's how we've gotten into this situation of the question but turns to Who belongs here and I know you talked a lot about juveniles being sent to maximum security prisons as teenagers call Bianco talked to a couple of going to grab the microphone hear what your name says it's 25 years to life at the age of 16 obviously what for what crime murder obviously the state thought you were a man did you feel like a man at that time no I didn't feel like anything I just didn't know you know my mind just wasn't in the right set and I couldn't sing past 5 minutes at that age and you were settling in an adult prison just thrown right into it all right thank you turn back now with Matt and Ryan even violent criminals brought as teenagers if they belong in a maximum-security adult present any children in adult jails and prisons we recognized in this society that there's a difference between children and adults we don't let 17 year olds vote for a reason we don't let them drink we don't let them smoke weed size that your opportunity to develop isn't complete until we say we're going to actually protect you from things that might hurt you but in this era of the fear and anger we just threw that out the out the out the room exception for a violent crime murder I actually think you know we have too many children in this country were born into violent families that live in violent neighborhoods their lives are shaped like a crucible of violence and when you're surrounded by addiction and dependency and Trauma and people are threatening you and menacing you and nobody's helping you are going to react violently but I don't think that's all about that child that's about the rest of us so no I don't think we should be putting children and adult jails and prisons and and I also think we've got a lot of Reform work to do in this phase we've got 13 states in this country that have no minimum age for trying a child as an adult's Angola prison I meet a guy named Henry 17 years old killed a cop life in prison no possibility of parole it was 72 when I I met him we talked to the grandson of his victim and I want to play this because it's opened up a whole another question about where we're going here here it is there's no parole for Charles hurt his life sentence is permanent and my mom my aunt my uncle I believe in the system is that it did this Equal justice but honestly I don't think anybody can sit there and say that he can never be a threat again he needs to finish doing whatever his obligations are to get the parole if she's ever granted parole and congratulations to him but personally I think he sees where he needs to be I'm imagining a lot of people right now listen to that man is shaking their auntie I feel the same way about it that was a family member of mine we look at so much of Criminal Justice right now through statistics and charge like we showed him I'm going to go but how do you remove or do you remove bats that personal that emotional connection how do you take that out of the equation as you look at mass incarceration well I mean first of all we heard it when I was sixteen by juveniles I've had family members sexually assaulted I understand the pain of that what I want to say to people is what we can do better than beat up on the people who commit these crimes we can actually start working on how we create an environment where there's less murder less rate less violence I do believe we have to hold people accountable but we can't be a society that once every member to not be defined by the worst thing we've done if you want that for yourself if you want Mercy for yourself then you have to be willing to give it to other people and I just think that we actually can't be about can't be decent I do believe that we are all more than the worst thing we've ever done I think it's somebody tells a lie they're not just a lie I think if they take something or not just a t think even if you kill somebody you're not just a killer and we got to understand the other things you are before we judge you and I just think a world without Mercy is not a world that's going to allow us to progress and if a family member is too angry and two broken into hurt to not be able to see that that's okay I don't think we should leave at 2 that we have an organized society that has to step in that's why it's the people versus Henry Montgomery it's the state it's not that offender and I don't want a world where the people were victimized by crime are responsible for making sure that they get the justice that they deserve I don't think that's a fair world and what we see too often is a 12th race economic status poor people black people brown people undocumented people are victimized so much more than other communities have created a world too much where it turns on the status of the victim I don't think that's fair and also the founder of free America John Legend So I got to see it to know each other some time with some of the inmates hear it sing sing before our broadcast you do this around the country when you talk about what we've done with free America we've gone on a listening and learning to a we've gone to a lot of facilities around the country State County Federal facilities juvenile facilities and we listen to people we want to hear what their issues are with their experiences have been what led them to get to these facilities in the first place and we want to really go out and tell their stories and it it's been really powerful for me to listen to folks who are in the system who often aren't heard from and like Brian said we need to realize he looks like human these folks are our family members are community members and they shouldn't be only defined by the worst thing they've done and we talked a lot about people's families today and we have to realize every time we lock someone up with locking their family up with them I said it was collateral damage today and somebody correctly corrected me and said no it's primary damage because it's not just collateral damage when a child loses their father or their mother that's primary damage that's felt by that family and there's 2.7 million children in America right now we have at least one parent in prison that will later but we should know that you have a personal story here on briefly tell me your mom story what my mother she responded to the loss of her mother by getting depressed and then self-medicating with illegal drugs and so she spent some time in the local jail she wasn't incarcerated for a long time but I have plenty of family members who have been through the system and we seen bold as remaining family members who are still in the community and we've seen with that with the individuals themselves the need for a smart assistant that actually helps people get better because my mother didn't need to be locked up during that time she needed help she needed help with her dependency issues and the trauma that she went through having lost her mother and I think so many folks are reacting to the trauma that they felt the fear that they feel when their neighborhoods by doing something they shouldn't do doing something at the legal but we're not fixing the problem by locking them up for a long. Of time when we should be really trying to figure out a way to help you with Brian. I just pissed right quickly react to that notion primary damage is supposed to Collateral Damage any question I have been in too many homes where mothers and daughters and children and brothers have actually been so Shattered by the loss of someone when they think that their loved one is being treated unfairly that they've been wrongly convicted we got a lot of people who are straight-up innocent in our jails and prisons we shouldn't ignore the fact that make a lot of mistakes in this system is a crisis that we need to address now to break the cycle of mass incarceration and we'll take a look at how rapper Meek Mill has put some long-standing policies in the spotlight will be right back welcome back we're here at New York Sing Sing prison and we want to talk for a moment about rapper Meek Mill I've spoken with him many times over the past year or so is a well-known advocate of prison reform and he seen the problem up close Runnings with the law as a teenager landed in behind bars and for years afterward it was tripped up by technical violations of his probation things like failing to report travel plans from high-profile supporters rally to his cause including Jay-Z and Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin is a simple as getting a technical violation and losing your job losing your house losing a family trying to go to work in my travel schedule got confused with my probation officer I don't think that's nothing to be placed in a Cell you know I'm people kind of looked at that is normal but the rules are the rules and if you violate you can go back to jail some of these rules are only designed for certain people to feel like kids coming in there again 10-15 years of Probation and you know going back to prison for not even committing crime tell me how your life is change what you have done since getting out of prison people people who have a lot of resources and we trying to make changing I make the system better or you're trying to change it and create laws here where I'm from we just ran without being on probation that bill caps on probation to want to get a million people out of the system by 2023 will keeping Community safe with morning after you're released you told me wanted to be a voice for the voiceless and you're doing that you not brush shoulders with a lot of people who actually lost their whole lives to the system and I got out of there I want to use my voice and doing the most with my opportunity is no that's what I always want to do I got a chance a shot and I'm taking it right into this rejoin once again by John Legend and we're happy to welcome former Attorney General Loretta Lynch who served under President Obama and it was spoken out about how tough it can be for former prisoners to re-enter Society also wear this is Nick Turner who leads the Vera Institute of justice and fighting for Criminal Justice Reform and we do want to acknowledge Matthew Charles who earlier this year became one of the first prisoners released out of the Federal First Step act and Matthew were to talk to you a little bit later but I wanted to acknowledge you as I start off with an attorney general Lynch and let's talk about the first step law we just heard the idea that probation that's one policy that people are talking about right now but another is his idea of early please for those convicted of nonviolent criminal offenses hasn't gone far enough it's a good step It's a combination of a lot of discussions people have been having on these issues for years and I'm hopeful it's the beginning of ongoing bipartisan discussions but if you really want to deal with the problems of mass incarceration we're going to have to deal with keeping people out of prison in the first place once they are here we have to recognize it what we have is untapped human capital and give people true opportunities to earn the credits to come home early and then once they in fact or in those credits or when clemency Irwin leniency give them a meaningful path to truly come home opening on the state level we would talk about Louisiana earlier but what's going on their house for quite some time for many states Ace of people typically don't think of as involved in prison Texas my home state of North Carolina and others have looked at this issue for years and it and it looked at it primarily from an economic point of view they focus on the human cost in the moral issues what states quickly realize that the cost of prison which is risen over 600% since 1980 was something that they could not sustain and thereby making smaller investments in prevention programs and re-entry programs in diversion programs and drug treatment programs particularly keeping non-violent offenders out of prison and giving them a true path to health again not only did they reduce their prison populations crime has gone down in those States looking at it with your foundation is the box that box that that idiot you get out of prison you got an education you ready to go in and fill out that application is little box there and says what have you committed a felony before have you got to check if you have to check it and what ends up happening is in all these different ways but that all that up we're saying to people when you get out of prison that you were never able to shake that we're saying you can't get housing and you're saying you can't get a job we're saying it's going to be hard for you to navigate life and some states you can vote we're making it almost impossible for people to become citizens again we want them to integrate back into society that we need them to the way they're going to keep us safe the way they're going to keep their themselves and their family safe is if they're able to get a job if they're able to reintegrate and if we want to prevent recidivism which is people returning to prison we need to make sure that people have options when they come out of prison I want to turn to Nick right again on this policy issue you've been looking at a lot about what happens inside the razor wire here are both here and the United States what some of the low hanging fruit in terms of policy refers imprisons this gets right to the point that Loretta was talking about and first the first step back I think of the first step Act is the appetizer it is only as good as the second and third and fourth steps that happen after that and we talked about how the state and local systems are really the ones that run criminal justice but the federal government can do a lot to we are sitting on top of the 25th anniversary of the 1994 crime bill which didn't create mass incarceration but it accelerated it and it did things like create a 10 billion dollar pot of money to persuade states to end early release to expand sentences and short people live longer will it be until it did things like and a Pell Grants for incarcerated students we have an opportunity right now on the 25th anniversary to actually reinstate Pell that's a example and is bipartisan Republicans and Democrats agree and we should be asking the federal government to do more clearly the 1994 crime bill was an aberration it was terrible but so what we need from the federal government and it may not happen today or tomorrow but we need to figure out how the federal government can actually drive decarceration in this country has one of these in his head he is we on this journey was what you guys have done at the variance in terms of looking overseas what they're doing in Europe I know one size doesn't fit all but what things struck you were there that that we should be thinking about this conversation we've been talking so much about humanity and centering the humanity of people who are unfortunate to be in contact with the justice system and that is the most important thing that I took away from my time in Germany and Norway which is that human dignity is Central that's a hard concept perhaps for people to understand so let me just tell you a story that gives a great example Haitian of a governor and Corrections officials and heads of right and left organizations to Germany and the very first prison that we visited with something called an open prison it is a place where people they sleep but they go out to be with their family or they can bacon work and it's at next door to the equestrian center for children's it was mind-boggling immediately this idea of an open prison we're sitting there we're having a conversation and a gentleman walks by us and a nod Shiley and he's stopped at his door and he takes keys out of his pocket and he unlocks the door and he takes off his outside shoes and he puts on slippers and he goes inside and he was someone who was house there and he's being treated like a human being who is going to be released and who the corrections officials. Was absolutely important they prepare him for that limit turn to someone who I think was on one of those strips at the end of incarcerated you dedicate a lot of your life to some of these policy issues I asked about low-hanging fruit what do you think can change in the near-term actually look at what happened in the fact that individuals are seen as humans so when you start making policies for the individuals that you're talking about and you see them as humans you started responding as human with human dignity and one of the things I think that happened in Germany is they created policies to make sure they never recreate the Holocaust so they have healed from there harm in America we haven't healed from this aspect of slavery and our criminal justice system is replicating and resembling a element of slavery and black and brown bodies are the results of that that we are seeing incarcerated you are you're a prosecutor in New York Federal prosecutor New York when you were Prosecuting cases did you think about the conditions that that they convicted with going to a prosecutor in 1990 and I was a Narcotics prosecutor and one of the first things that struck me Lester was it so many of the people that I was Prosecuting could just as easily have been the victims in the crimes that that I was considering them for and so it makes you realize that your role is bigger than just sending people on this assembly line into prison and you also look at the communities from which people came and he's our communities that offer don't get the protection of the law but then get the Hammer of the law all the time and so if you can in fact expand opportunities in communities and work on prevention programs you can keep people from Ashley starting down that path you do think about it I remember vividly standing in court before we abolish life sentences for juveniles and hearing a federal district judge sentence a young man was at the time itching but a committed the crime just before he was 18 send some to life in prison for something that he had done was the statue called for it no one in that courtroom thought that was the way that that was the right thing to do but we all were in that process I am so we have to look back and learn from what we have been doing one of the benefits we have now it is the 25th anniversary of the 94 crime Bill we now know what works and we know what doesn't work mass incarceration has not made us safer it has in fact decimated communities it is torn apart families and it is harmed children that should not be a part of our justice system those are not the goals of justice and we have to look at it from that are the times to families and innocent children store because as a man you know you was a boy at one point you know what you need and I know he needs these things and I'm not there to provide she was home I'm going to Sail by myself now so I can't cry when I want to cry Sing Sing Correctional Facility has stood on the banks of the Hudson River for nearly two hundred years from 1500 men are incarcerated here most of them for violent crimes it can be a dangerous place but it's also a place that offers inmates the tools they need to turn their lives around if they choose to let's keep the conversation going out with John Legend and a couple of additional guests I like to introduce after 30 years has a public defender Robin Steinberg founded the bail project dedicated to helping those who can't afford bail stay out of prison and a brush with prison as a young woman leader with life of activism for Topeka Sam founder of a ladies of Hope Ministries focusing on helping women in prisons and I'm helping them get what they need out of it she created Hope House offering women's support and safety is a transition back into society good to have built-in to join the panel what I want to talk to you about this idea of bail on any given night there almost half million people sitting pretrial we're sitting in jail for the only reason they can't afford a thousand bucks for their bail that's true and it's the tip of the iceberg there are half a million people sleeping in jail cells tonight who can't pay bail but if you think about across the country or state and local jails we have three thousand of them and On Any Given year we turned almost 11 million people in and out of those local jails set the bail issue disproportionately impact low-income people people of color and yes women and that is because women are the bottom there and I'm a totem pole and don't make the same amount of money that men do for the same job it's also because they are more likely the primary caregivers 80% of women in the system are moms there's a primary caregivers and they're forced to make a decision between feeding their children and keeping a roof over their head or paying for their Veil so they stay in jail cells while their face are are destroyed outside and focus on what we have to realize this is big business these Bail Bonds companies there's a 2 billion dollar industry these folks are being locked up purely because they can't afford to pay something so essentially what we're saying is you should be locked up if you're poor and then on top of that a lot of people are locked up because they've not paid a fine or a fee for a minor offense we saw in Ferguson when they did the federal a report on what was going on in Ferguson that a lot of folks were being targeted for these small fines and fees that start to add up and then they get locked up because they don't pay the fees and then they can't get out of jail because they can't pay the bail Circle I know you believe if release for nonviolent offenders they should be treated differently than men actually believe that women girls should not be in prison at all and respected to whether it's a violent and non-violent crime I feel like there are alternatives to incarceration that we need to start to reput and reinvest money back into our communities that to Robin's point that women are the most vulnerable population that there is a zoo outside of being Mother's Day sex with sexual trauma and violence there is addiction there is a substance misuse then people specifically women are being criminalized for this for poverty for substance misuse the children end up in foster care they end up with different family members and then they end up broken from their parents and so unfortunately what's happening is that is spilling his trickling over into our communities and then what happens as the children end up with no one a perpetuating in the system we're having women bearing children in prisons with handcuffs and leg cuffs on we're having women who some some programs we visited in Washington state over the women's prison where they they were doing something that's a bit more Humane by saying will allow you to raise your kids up to a certain amount of time in the facility but then you turn around and think well that's the Humane thing to do but it's inhumane that we've been having these women in prison in the first place when there could be other ways of dealing with these situations that allow them to be with their families are addressing this again on the on the bail issue tell me what your group is doing performing our cash bail system lights 99% gel run this country over the past 20 years has been the result of unaffordable cash bail being sat on people's cases that they don't have enough money to pay we're talking about a hundred dollars $500 $1,000 in may as well be a million for most likely to plead guilty if it's if you're as leverage she has terrible things can happen so there might be taken from New York you may lose your home you may lose your job you may thrown out of school and the only way out if you don't have the cash to pay your cash bail is when the judge says if you plead guilty I'll let you go home everybody will plead guilty under the circumstances I would have my friends pay people's bad when I was in the county jail awaiting trial myself because they were sitting there for up to a year on $100 and to think about that and think what would you do if your children with Stripped Away if you lost your house your job and you just wanted to get back to your family you would please guilty to most people this idea of being involved in the system I want a show of hands how many here have had a family member or someone close to you or you or even been incarcerated yourself again with family that have an impacted I know this crap thank you thank you obviously you this this this is an audience made up of people who are dedicated to the subject but we sometimes lose sight it's like a stone dropping into a pond the ripples just keep going and going and going and if I mean it's 70 million people who have criminal convictions in this country so though you think that it's really just in this space that people are impacted it's happening everywhere unfortunately it's still this huge stigma I'm around incarceration so people don't speak up you know if you say it's one in every three adults just like children, impacted have been impacted by the criminal legal system and you would know that more than the people that actually raise their hands even in here have had a loved one or someone they know that's been incarcerated wow let me talk to you talk to the shopping list and Steven Hines or dad to tell me about your legacy of incarceration then I became incarcerated and just recently my son has to become incarcerated did you expect given your history did you expect that at some point that would happen to him you had a classroom and we would discuss something I mentioned that my father was incarcerated and it was shocking to learn that the substantial majority of men that was in that room indicated that their fathers were incarcerated as well so it has caused all of us to think about our children and we formulated of fatherhood support group for you have you have a relationship with you Repose and they go in different directions and on that point I want to bring Anna by can Aswad Thomas I swipe thanks for being with us how many how many members of your family have been shot unfortunately including myself as a victim of gun violence at 5 out of 10 males and my immediate family are victims of gun violence in one of the young man that shot me a he was a victim of gun violence yeah that the individual who shot you he was facing perhaps forty years in prison you was a victim though said no it's going to be better when you went to the prosecutor what did you what did you tell him I wanted to talk to him first and that young man was from my community boss I wanted to you know to advocate for him not to be able to get Rehabilitation and so that you know he instead of getting 40 years in jail that he will be sentenced to 10 years as a victim with that decision was made that's when the healing process really starting to feel good grew up in the same environment that I did I miss all we were no different I just had the opportunity to go to college become the first generation college graduate thank you for sure Loretta Lynch before before we go to a break I just want to get your thoughts on this cycle of incarceration and they're the Ripple effects on families in those are affected the nail on the head what we're doing is when you incarcerated individual you are incarcerated my family and if you're going to have a truly effective justice system that has to be foremost in our consideration we have to find ways to keep families connected while parents are in prison particularly with mothers have young children and need that connection what is part of recognizing the humanity that binds all of us we're talkin about how do we treat people who broken the laws of society how would we want to be treated if we broke those same laws as well as we've got to always keep that in the Forefront of our mind as well break away come back most people behind bars will get out sooner or later but too many of them they end up right back in prison some ideas about how to break that cycle based on first-hand experience when we continue in just a moment in 2001 he was found guilty of running a massive drug ring since was 150 years that's right 150 years are cameras weren't allowed inside the parole hearing room about an hour later astin's family walked out first very good my son from 150 years sentence for drug violations us back to Matthew Charles and we met earlier Matthew got out of prison in January after more than two decades behind bars on drug and gun charges a beneficiary of the newly enacted First Step act as a first step toward prison reform but getting out itself is often just the first step of a long and difficult Journey here to talk about that right now is Matthew Charles Matthew great to have you with us you and I spoke when you were locked up I spoke right after you left it look familiar to you or hear you thinking about your future from walking out I was thinking about just being back being idle with my family and friends but the fact that I was able to walk out this was a breath of fresh air fancy remodel prison your story got a lot of attention and yet you found yourself where a lot of guys found themselves things didn't always come easy what was the biggest struggle thank you and we're glad things are working out better for you all right George Craig our next guest Shawn pecas serve more than 15 years on manslaughter turn his life around and is now the executive director of Hudson link for higher education in prison providing education and life skills to incarcerated men and women and helping them re-enter Society Lawrence Berkeley spent 27 years in prison is not a director of the publication news inside for The Marshall Project a non-profit news organization focusing on the US Criminal Justice System Lawrence and Shawn both did time here at sing sing and it brings us to Mike Capra Michael Capra who for the past seven years has been the superintendent of this facility after a long and impressive career in law enforcement great to see all of you and thank you for for hosting is here your job here as the superintendent make sure everyone saved to make sure your employees get home safe at the end of the day but you realize that wasn't enough and then programs were necessary what do you find the more programs and occupational so you can do your how does that change the environment well I think as a system we certainly have declined in the amount of inmates that we have you see the men that are here today these two guys who have known for many years here I've always been part of this movement called voices from within which is just a bunch of guys are really want to think about tomorrow think about the children coming and they don't want them to file the same steps that they have filed number one in and also to make an impact on the inmates who are here to give them hope and to give them a positive role model to look for it so that our system is a little bit safer I was surprised when I go on my last visit here talking to the guys and they they want to be part of the change on the out when they are on the outside part of the change they all want to be part of they are think-tank group of people who ask these guys right now how many have a college education right now I'm mostly going to raise their hands and so when they get involved in looking towards what can we do to change the culture inside and out and making the inside of the Cilia safer place there is how much involved and they have some fantastic ideas and we're putting those ideas to work so it's paying attention voice changed you for the better I know it sounds crazy but I live in 9 McIntosh County prison's over 16 years I never met award until I got to sing sing and Brian Fisher was awarded time would walk the halls and talk with a hell you in school why are you why you got here and it really pushes and I remember like it was yesterday probably eight years ago you said to me hey what if we did more and it's just not a normal question from a super 10 in the magistrate prisoner think about doing more here like college and music and theater and an instructed work to make us dig deeper into what causes to be here in the first place to see months is 27 years in the system nine of them here since the first day I slept went to prison cot when I finally got the opportunity to get out you know this it was like the movies that have watch when you go into the future and all this technology you see and I was I was Marvel bow wow this is super great you know so in doing that and then when I finally got the opportunity from Marshall Project to get some gainful employment you know I didn't think that I was special but I intentionally went out to do exceptionally well because I was doing it for the men behind me a song about the men behind you if you know these guys right what are you tell them what do you tell them about life on the outside outside is everything you dreamed up everything we always dreamed of it being as exactly what it's like but when we would spend all that time and in creating those programs that came out of my head and every step of the way that we we're not getting paid for it we just tore through it we argue throughout meetings all of it is worth it because those skills are transferable on outside and if you do that you set the bar high and not only you do it for yourself in your family you doing it for everyone win a prison uniform in a country that just wants a chance what is Auto Parts it is it's difficult but I intentionally did not a difficulty because I can't afford the field because I fell they all fell my children feel I can't do it and and what about how society looks at you would talk to you know which with John along with my checking the box of you and getting you a felon I mean people ask you why were you here and I got to be difficult conversation it is a difficult conversation but I like to think that my character speaks for itself I am not who I was at 17 years old when I committed the crime in fact I change what I was still in my teens and I have to suffer through a decade of incarceration when I wasn't that same individual any more so when I'm on the outside if people look down on me because I'm incarcerated I tell myself that's none of my business that's their perception has nothing to do with the way I'm going to live my life all right John Legend as well as some personal Reflections and final thoughts and what we talk about here today when we return in a month we're back at sing sing with John Legend for some final bachna thing I keep thinking of is that figure that 95% of those locked up or going to get out someday this could be on our streets in our neighborhoods with that in mind what do you want to leave I think the key is that we see each other's Humanity I think this nation has a legacy of treating certain people like they were subhuman I think slavery was part of the reason of that has been part of our national culture we have to see everybody black brown whatever they are whatever community that come from as part of our national Community think of their Humanity think of their families think of their emotions think of their possibilities for Redemption and then structure our system to account for that and every dollar we spend on prisons every dollar we spend on punishment is dollars we can't spend on education on Health Care on the things that makes our community stronger and let's continue to invest in things that make us stronger and stop investing so much and punishment will John you are obviously I bet she was important part of this conversation is so we thank you I'm much of our conversation today was framed by the many questions I wrestled with during my brief time visiting behind bars in Angola prison including one that I wrote down I wrote could any of us under the right circumstances make a mistake that would take away our freedom and then what where do accountability and Punishment and and Rehabilitation and Redemption begin and can there truly be justice for all on both sides of these walls it's a long long conversation certainly longer than one hour allows but it's one I'm dedicated to further exploring I want to thank John Legend Loretta Lynch and all of our panelists as well as my camper and his team here at Sing Sing Correctional Facility for hosting this important event for all of us said NBC news thank you for watching and so long is Chris Hayes from MSNBC everyday I come to the office and we make a television show and everyday I think to myself
