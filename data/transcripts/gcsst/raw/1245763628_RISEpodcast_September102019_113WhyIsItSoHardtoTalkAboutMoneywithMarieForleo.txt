Com rise business Marie forleo welcome to the rise podcast thank you so much for having me on I am so there's like a 0% chance that people don't already know who you are but let's pretend someone lives under a mushroom and they've never heard of you will you tell them who you are what you're into what you do give us give us the Spiel it's not the real honest truth of your hard work and dedication is truth I've been doing this which is supporting people helping them achieve their biggest goals and dreams for 20 years now which kind of blows my mind I am the host of a show called Marie TV which is also the Marie forleo podcast we have a program that called be school which is online business school for modern entrepreneurs we had like 55,000 mazing humans go through that program and yeah and I just wrote a new book called Everything Is figureoutable how one simple belief will help you change your life in the world and then I like apart from that profession stop let's see here okay this was probably one of the coolest things Rachel this is the last thing I'll say that's official and then we're going to get into some other fun stuff so I miss Oprah a few years back called me a thought leader for the Next Generation which practically had me on the floor like drooling and just like is this real but the unofficial stuff I love zombie movies roller coasters I cook a 12-hour pasta and I dance kind of non-stop I want I mean like I want to unpack each of those levels but what my brain is focusing on right now most is a 12-hour pasta like a sauce yeah I like that okay it's just simmers like a really long simmer so you will find me some mornings in my kitchen chopping garlic and onions at like 6:30 a.m. to get this puppy started and then sometimes I have to let you know shut off the burner and let it sit overnight and then pick it back up in the morning but once it's done it is like the thickest richest deep red color and spaghetti sauce and you know my stepson and my man Josh and anyone who's had the pleasure of having the sauce they really look forward to add that to my list of like my vision for my future is that someday I get to have the sauce in the most important place that we can which is that the other day I was scrolling through shopbop and I was shopping for clothes because I cut my hair and as you do I felt like I needed new clothes to go with my new hair and as I was shopping I found a skirt that you need to buy and I almost screenshot it and send it to you but I was like we are not close enough friends for me to like I have access to text you but it felt very inappropriate to send you clothes to buy but now that we met okay now that we've known him I'm mad and when I leave yeah I'm going to argue with you right now because I'm to go back to some of our conversations and I'm also going to go back to some of our texts which if you actually look at that string I think it will refresh your memory you should be sending me a lot more than screenshot the rider it's you'll just wait okay I just will say I'm going to prep because when I got off the phone with him to go find it I was like there is literally only one woman that I know that can pull off the skirt and it is Marie and so I'm going to check and you'll understand and if you don't buy it I'll buy it for you I just want you to wear cuz your body can handle in mind can't I'm Rachel Holland and I've built a multimillion-dollar media company with a high school diploma and the free information I found on the internet in the 15 years that I've been building and scaling my company I have become deeply passionate about helping other entrepreneurs to do the same so each week I'll be sharing tangible and tactical advice and inspiring interviews with the same intention these are the tools to change your life and your business this is the right podcast can we I want to talk about this thing that I feel like I have a very limited group of girlfriends so I can talk about this with and you are one of them and I think it's superb as a super powerful conversation I stay on saifee I assume nothing is off-limits but you tell me if we need to like edit this part out the idea of what it has meant for you to be a successful female entrepreneur and the reason I asked that question is because there is and you're not have talked about this before the there is a certain amount of backlash I think that happens for female entrepreneurs who are financially successful that does not happen to men and you know it like I have you on Instagram right now all of its like so popular for guys to be entrepreneurs and their on their private jet and they're in their fancy car and everybody idolizes them but as a female has a woman any kind of talk about success or any kind of anything there are immediately trolls who want to bash that down and I'm just curious like what what that Journey has been like because you are the woman that so many of us in this industry look up to is like my Lord like Maria's over there killing that's why I see you're like quiet you like a sniper your lie quietly free what's a just like with so much grace and so but but that it has to have has it has that touched you or have you felt that a hundred percent so let's talk about it in different stages because I think for all of us when we're on our Journeys you know different things hit us in different ways and I remember it was probably around the year like 2012 2013 2014 like we had this kind of my goodness like a stratospheric sleep in our revenues and our profits right and we hit like the Inc 500 list and when you do that it kind of exposes you right for the people see the revenue and then they make all these assumptions and I just remembered this is I think what was most challenging for me to talk about in current times to I think one of the hardest things is I know myself and first of all I will say this right now in your show I love money I think you and I told you the money I don't love it over people like I never loved it over my values but I love money and I love teaching other people especially women to love money in it that comes from my childhood that comes from I'll tell it just a super-fast story because I think this relates to what we're talkin about don't like my parents got divorced when I was about eight and I remember the day that my parents sign the divorce papers I was standing in my kitchen and I was watching my mom she's lost like about 15 lb she was standing on the phone bawling her eyes out Rachel likes you know when you just see your mama I'd like her eyes were Bloodshed she was shaking she was talking to her mom who's in Florida at the time and she was saying like I have nothing I have nothing that you would like screaming into the phone she hung up the phone she bent down so that her eyes were level with mine again I was about 70 years old she took me by the shoulders right and she shook me and she said don't you ever ever let a man control your money look at me right now do not be stupid like I was you make your own money you make your own way you be independent and successful and do not be anything like me Rachel when that you know and look when we as adults and as with our adult eyes we can see there cuz we understand how challenging it can be to raise a family we can understand how challenging relationships can be and we can understand this kind of experiences and as a child though I made a promise to myself because my dad was amazing they weren't necessarily fighting over like infidelity there wasn't any kind of substance addiction it was all about money my mom feeling like she never had enough of it and have any control over it and that she felt powerless and I made myself a promise that when I grew up that I was going to earn so much money reach that I would never allow money to take away love again that I was going to share of people that I would take care of my family that I would take care and you know as a kid you talk to other kids and there was other kids that were having similar issues when I did so I just had this notion in my head that when I got to be an adult who's going to take care of people and if that meant financially I would do that too and I will tell you out of that pain has come a driving force in me to ensure that women are financially free that's part of what drives be school that's why I get so freaking fired up about it and it was so crazy that that is your where your this comes from for you because not the same my mom was not the same like different but the same I was in I mean it was like whatever they broke up for like the sixth time in a row in Middle School were living in a crappy apartment and with like garage sale Furniture we had I remember my birthday present my 12th birthday party in this crappy apartment with a store bought cake and like City Furniture I remember standing at this table that we got at a yard sale and it was just remember thinking like at cuz at 12 that I got this that it was her attempt to exert her independence day by leaving and getting her own apartment and taking her daughter and all of these things but it didn't mean a lot if you had spent the last however many years of your life with him is the breadwinner and you didn't have your own money and now we're drowning because of that like my IRA my birthday candle wish and like it I write this in the books of people can send letters to someone else about it but my birthday candle wish 12 years old so like you're drowning financially was I'm going to be so rich someday and it was a hot so crazy that you said cuz I didn't know that story about you it is so crazy that both of ours came from divorce where are Mom was struggling financially and thinking like I'm not going to be like that yes and like so from me I was always it was like in a heart that money was this tool for healing it was like that's how I had this equation kind of locked up in my head and then so to back to your original question about this whole money thing right and perception that one's be school started taking off and we kind of experience is Quantum Leap in our business and all of those things I just remember some people going like she's in this for the money and I got I remember like my Ruffles got that my feathers got ruffled and I just thought to myself in like oh my gosh I give people lifetime access to be school I have a refund on all of my programs like it is so important for me that people feel safe when they do some training program or invest with me like it just got me I got me even more fired up to be really honest with Rachel to make it even more successful and I made myself a promise that I was not going to listen to this voice is like I know who I am I wouldn't be around for 20 years in business if I was in the business of taking advantage of generosity is one of my biggest values it's why we do so much philanthropic work with our company because I'm constantly trying to use whatever resources we have like our platform Financial Resources my voice whatever we can do to continue to extend opportunities especially to women who don't have them you know there's this great saying R H I think you might like this one Talent is universal but opportunity is not and it's a driving force of what we do is why would you freaking scholarships it's what you know what I mean it's why we do everything but to your point the whole like in a money thing and here's the truth for me I'm not big into flexing publicly when it comes to my cash yes I just like having what I call you know a few money yes I mean tell me about the first time we talked for like every woman needs some Fu money and I was like this woman is my queen I now worship at her altar I thought so that no one can tell you you have to do X Y or Z you have to behave this way you need to show up here or that you have to endure just crappy treatment yet other or four people to make you feel behold into them on my conversation Enders everyone feel like they have you against the wall I'm like nope that's what great resources do and so Whitby School here's my proudest moment with outrage I was in I was in a grocery store in La and I'm like standing there I got my hair in a bun I got my take out to go a little food or whatever as I'm going to ask me the truth are you ready for that I was like yeah she's like oh my goodness she's like I tell you story she's like I would be school or she goes years ago I was about to be homeless and I sold my couch to do your program because I knew in my heart it was a path for me to get myself care if she goes I I'm a single mom and I have a multiple six-figure business to you I can take care of myself and my daughter and I wanted to let you know that and I was like that's why I do what I do as much as I love money it's like seeing other women free is what drives me absolutely I love I love this idea I saw this mean the other day that said you know but not everyone's going to track with us but I know you're going to get what I'm saying it was like you if you are actually wealthy you don't post a picture of yourself in the private plane can I like I like I'm going to get crap like so many people we know I mean can we stop with the private let come calm down calm down you guys I just have to say this like is there not a Global Perspective like I pay attention a lot to like the massive and growing in a quality and here's the thing both things can be true there's enough for everyone right there's more than enough to go around I believe that in my heart and I also believe that we need to work intentionally to take care of people like the fact that almost a billion people don't have access to clean water every day shame on us back that we spent $59 billion dollars a year as a global Society again I'm raising my hand I'm in this 59 billion dollars a year on ice cream while it would take 28 billion-a-year to provide education sanitation and health care to every human being is crazy so part of what I think this thing is is like here's what we know from the research when women are financially empowered everyone wins at yeah because of 80% more likely to reinvest in their communities so when we get money in the hands of women what do they do they invested in their families in their communities economies get stronger the world get stronger so I can Flex in about a private plane if you like him we take those resources and say hey can we use them enjoy our own abundance that is a beautiful thing but can we also spread that abundance and lift other people up thought to someone someone said this to me last year and I was like dang that's such a good idea because I guarantee you that there are women listening to this right now and I have a massive entrepreneur audience who listens in but still I guarantee their women listening to this right now who are very uncomfortable by the conversation that we're how and I was talking to a friend about I had we had reached a place financially that was more frankly than I had ever fathomed we could do as a company and I was having this instinctive like take my foot off the gas because I was honestly uncomfortable like I was your father old girl birthday candle wish I want to be rich but that was about security and I'm I'm good like forever right and so I was talking to a friend who this is why the people you surround yourself with are so important but someone much further along as an entrepreneur and philanthropist and I said you know I feel kind of I'm I'm feeling a little weird like it seems odd to keep pushing when we're already doing so well and he said Rachel imagine that there's a dollar on the table and there's all these entrepreneurs in the world and any of us can get that dollar and if you get the dollar you know what you're going to do with it you know that you're going to create jobs you know you're going to give back you know you that you have these plans in these visions that help your community grow things help your family all of it right but you don't know what someone else is going to do with the dollar so there is some like if you have the ability There's Something Beautiful about what you can do because while while I love it you talked about how you guys give back like we have 10% of company profits to charity yes we don't talk about it because I can this is not about getting the marketing or the pr for this but it was just something that we felt on our hearts was right to do so yeah that's what I get to do with my well so I guess it's like if you're listening to this and it's making you feel uncomfortable you have to ask yourself is that because you don't understand what's possible or because you have decided that their scarcity surrounding money and that if we have it you can't do not do it does that scarcity the money thing like does that pop up in your community ever of course I think it's true for most of us think there is the scarcity myth that there's just not enough to go around when it comes to Financial Resources money but also when it comes to opportunity right like someone had she might like that's it Rachel's Corner the market if there's no more success or anyone else it's like that all of it is rooted in the same not enough nest and that's not enough Nest permeates our soul and makes us think we are not enough so scarcity as a force of nature I believe is one of the most destructive there is not everyone listening doesn't have to have the same financial goals I always like to talk to folks that I work with and say hey bigger dreams aren't necessarily better dreams like each of us are unique in our desires and we honor and respect that uniqueness but I think the more of us who have big hearts who want to make a difference Beyond just our own bottom line that we want to see positive change in the world where we see more peace and more dignity and we're Harmony and more people being lifted up I want to see those people have strong financial lies whatever that looks like to them at such an Idaho sorry I keep jump exciting it's exciting stuff we're having a really just going to say I love that reminder at my two very best friends are they are just absolute in this is why we're best friends they're absolutely so different for me when it comes to being an entrepreneur and making them like they they told me literally our goal is to make exactly enough money that we can spend the most time together possible and that's the goal and they have the most beautiful life and they are the funniest people I know and they are so freaking happy and they they are so supportive like they're the greatest types whatever but they're like girl you you're crazy like what they're so and they are on their doing their own thing and I'm doing and we like just respect the hell out of each other and love and an RN Community but my gosh are we different and it takes All Kinds of Kinds right like you do not have to have our attitude towards money you do not have to have our attitudes towards growth my ask is that we as a society of community a Sisterhood cuz we you know half million women listening to this right now. Even if a woman isn't like you it doesn't make her wrong because by the way it's not men who are at I don't know about you but it's not men on the internet who are attacking me ever know your night times at not actually I would say for me there's a there's definitely a little handful we you know we have some fun with them of course some dudes were like what are you doing buddy, you must be mad but I will agree that the the larger person portion can candy limit so I like where you're going with us yeah I do not shop in a store who even I got four kids I have a dog that requires attention I got a business to run I do not shop and store I am all about the online shopping and I'm going to assume that you are too cuz most of us are just getting all the things through the computer right if you are online shopping in the way that I am why haven't you downloaded honey yet cuz I've been talking about it I keep telling you about it on podcast episode because it's the easiest thing in the world so honey is a browser extension that you can get onto your computer right now and just two clicks and what it does is that when you are already on a store let's say you're on nordstrom.com you're over there at all Davy you're looking to see what is happening at I don't know / thousand different online retailers honey is automatically scanning the internet to see what discounts are available for you it just applies it you didn't have to do anything it's totally free it saves you money the average honey user saves about $126 per year there is literally no reason not to do this you guys it's going to take you 2 seconds just go over and get on honey listen to there is really no reason not to use honey it's free to use and installed on your computer and just two clicks and it'll save you money so you can treat yourself to something pretty get honey for free at joinhoney.com rise that's joinhoney.com rise let's talk about the book will not tell me if I'm wrong but did this book come out of a keynote it did it come out of a speech like tell me that like what's the impetus yeah the images so this notion this philosophy this idea everything is figureoutable I learned it as a child and I've been talking about it and teaching about it for the past two decades but you are absolutely correct so back in 2015 I was at an event with the folks from OWN Oprah Winfrey Network and then co-president of the network a woman named Sarah Salata she's like Hammer he's just like you have to be free on April 9th 2016 and I was like of course I'll be free no matter what if I'm not free I will be free and she said okay cuz that we're having this thing called a supersoul session where is Oprah's inviting like nine other speakers including herself to give like a tad style talk button Oprah textile talk in California do you want to be one of those people and Rachel I practically started like jumping up and down and tell me a joke hartwell's right there that's one thing I have no ability to do I am like totally School person I have to show a recessive I have no Poker Face whatsoever so I said yes and then of course the next thing you must decide is what is your talk going to be about and I had been approached by a Publisher's for years I had an agent who was just like, a girl like everybody wants a book from you and I was like but I don't want to write a book like I've got all these other things that I'm focused on right now and anyway the idea came to me I said I think this talk needs to be everything is figureoutable and I think this is my kind of nut petri dish that's kind of the wrong word but it was my my potential to roll out this idea in a public setting and to feel those from the inside and externally if this is what I wanted the entire book to be about so I did that talk and it was awesome it was of course absolutely gut-wrenching like I cannot even tell you how bad I tortured my and how nervous I was like thinking about who was listening to me the audience that's just a total forget about it but anyway once I did that talk I was like yes this is the book and then that was the launching of the writing of it and how long how long does it take you like to run. Moment to hear ya so the speech was given in 2016 I sold the book meaning you know had my proposal and went around and did all the meetings with the Publishers in 2017 and we had always slated for fall of 2019 for a release I just wanted like a really long run way and so yeah so it kind of took I didn't start writing the book like actually sitting down and typing it until the like late for All of Us winter of everything 2017 or 20 yet 2017 it took me a little over a year to get everything together and then turned it in winter of last year and what are you I'm going to know there's so much information in it all the things that we pack all the knowledge that we have but as you're thinking about this launch the things that you are most excited like man if if the readers can get this like if they can latch onto these two or three things this is a game-changer will I think the phrase is in and of itself that everything is figureoutable which is a pretty bold statement right to say I'm really is everything is figureoutable and I think if they can accept that but I want to unpack a little bit because for anyone listening who might be cynical or skeptical first of all I say welcome to the party I love that you are here and actually when I first started writing the book Rachel I was out to brunch with a friend who has an eight-year-old son and we were talking about like what projects are working on and that her son was like oh what's your book about cuz I didn't say the title yet and I said everything is figureoutable and quickly he crossed his arms and he's like no it's not as like this is awesome I would like tell me more and he said well I can't grow human working wings out of my back and I was like well that's correct as of now but have your search the thing called crisper and you do in fact know that we humans can fly and he was like man and then he's like well I can't get my childhood dog back from the dead and I was like well that's accurate as of now I said but scientists are working on cryogenics and people have cloned their dog needs like she kind of right and that inspired me to create some rules around this notion because for anyone who's like the thinking of their head right now know everything's not figure out of all this will help you give yourself a mental container so that you can use the notion to do what it is intended to do which is to awaken your innate wisdom so that you can achieve any goal solve any problem and contribute meaningfully to others so here's the three rolls ready for him. I'm ready roll number one all problems or dreams are figureoutable rule number two if a problem is not figure out Apple it's not a problem it's a fact of life like s gravity laws of nature you may not care enough to solve this particular problem or reach this particular dream and that's okay find something you do care deeply about and go back to rule number one so that will rule that really helped us stay in his own right and not go to Fantastical things and then I'll say one more thing Rachel before continuing to dig into your question which is a perfect one you know a lot of people often even friends of mine right there like know this isn't figureoutable like what about the really tough stuff like a terminal diagnosis so you know I mean or death or loss or grief and I was like I'm so happy about that up because after I gave the Oprah talk what happened rage is we started to get letters in the mail and I want to tell a quick story about a woman named Jen who wrote to us so Jen said I loved her over talk it was amazing I listen to it again with my mom it's something that she had been trying to teach me my whole life and she's like my best friend but then Marie something happened everything changed she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and all of a sudden nothing seemed figureoutable but then she said she took a step back and she looked more deeply at what was happening and it turned out it was for example. She was able to get nursing care to her mom who lived in a rural area she was able to find foods that she can actually tolerate and most important she was able to get medical equipment which allowed her mom to spend her last days and in fact her last 5 weeks exactly where she wanted to be which is in her own house and so Jen wrote thank you so much for sharing that freeze because I can say without any hesitation that everything is indeed figureoutable and you made a huge difference to two women on the other side of the world that's awesome so this notion you were saying what do I hope like what's like the one or two things that people get besides just adopting that idea I think it's about really embracing the truth that they are a born Creator and that they have innate wisdom that's already inside of them that allows them to create change both in their own lives and in the lives of people around them how has this I mean cuz I want to talk about two things I want to talk to you and then I want to talk about the people that you have affected with your work how has this practice affected the business that you've built because I want listeners to understand if you are not familiar with Marie Marie is quietly like running the world like what you would like people don't track with when you're like a 55000 people like 50 5000 students 20 years in business that you are you are quietly like destroying the section of your like your sphere like it's beyond those of us who know you were like what the actual hell is going on with Marie cuz she's just being you destroying it yet again oh another launch the union made a good jillion dollars and if you like so so how has that how is this practice is it the Moon is always been a part of you as an entrepreneur and yeah so yeah let's talk about that so because I hate this phrase came for my mom and I tell that story in the back or at the end of the Oprah talk but it's it was kind of embedded into my DNA from my family now this doesn't mean like believing that everything is figureoutable doesn't make your life easy and it doesn't mean that you don't fall on your face and hit walls and cry in the corner and do you know just have snot coming out of your nose that does not does not mean any of those things that is me on a regular basis but it means I keep getting back up so when I started my business at 23 and I was so insecure I like the one side of my head was like who do you think you are like this coaching thing how weird you have even lift for life yet you're like tens of thousands of dollars a debt who do you think you are that you have anything to offer the world you know just kind of the Litany of Just self-destruction Happening in my mind but the other side of my heart felt like this was my calling even though it didn't make logical sense and then figuring out how to start a digital business back in the late 90s like I started doing email marketing in the year 2008 so I was bartending and waiting tables to keep a roof over my head while I was trying to figure out how to have a coaching business during the day and Rachel I would bring a yellow legal pad to the bar that I worked at and when people would inevitably be like so what else do you do like are you an actress and nothing against actresses by the way I'm you know my man is an actor I'm like no I'm actually a coat and then I would go into this whole thing and it would say I publish this Weekly Newsletter by the way I want to hear a cheesy title it was called magical moment of my email newsletter and a 2000 and I would sign people up to my list so to your question I have used this philosophy this Mantra this conviction at every single stage of my career and I still use it to this day like still to figure out stuff that we have cuz here's the thing and you know this better than anyone Rachel in order to grow your brand your business your life your relationships whatever 99% of what you have to do to grow is stuff that you probably never done before that you have no context for it's so far out of your comfort zone you are filled potentially with fear or a blend of fear and excitement and anxiety you know whole cocktail mix of It Isn't So this notion that everything is figureoutable allows you to step into the unknown to the groundless nature of growth with an odd sense of security that somehow you'll figure it out how has this like you've helped so many students over the years and the intention you're helping with goals and dreams and their life and all of it but I know that you've helped so many people build and scale their businesses so how has that practice at we talked about how it helps you but how has that shown up for your students yes so I think when it comes to be school that is it's interesting it's almost like a trojan horse because we talked a lot about sales and marketing and had to do it ethically and honestly and in a way that's really aligned with your personality and your values and your desire to make a difference Beyond yourself so when business owners really adopt those values and then they're able to put them into practice in a practical way Rachel they watch their businesses increase like if they have the right Market meaning they're like okay you know I am serving people that I really care about and that I really want to serve and they have a great product or service that actually solves a problem or meets a need when those things'll fine and they activate the strategies that we teach them it's usually a matter of time so I got a message the other day we have a thing at our company which is called letters from the community and so every week is our team kind of surfaces notes or you know messages on social or whatever it is that we feel kind of gives us a pulse on what's Happening and this actually just happened a couple days ago there was a note from a preschooler who joined like I don't know back in 2012 and her goal was to have a million dollar business and she had no business before and by the way she ain't selling business coaching right she's not a business consultant I think it's a skin care line if I'm not mistaken yeah memory serves right the skin care line and she said oh my God I just called back billions so rad and so she's been at it though so you ask a question like what is it that they learned they learned a lot of the ideas that we teaching the book but everything I teach in the book is almost baked into be school so we're practicing it through our sales and marketing but the philosophy is there so for example progress not Perfection progress not Perfection that's something I try and drill into people because you know you probably know this anyone listening they are attracted to you and your brand and your show because you're incredibly talented at what you do and you provide so much value and you're someone who I would imagine and correct me if I'm wrong you've got pretty high standards yeah right you just like I do like I recognize that and you and I think the downside for anyone listening who shares that same value is we can dip into perfectionism which can slow us down there so many negative aspects to it and you can like hold back you can know I can do this is not right yet and you just slow yourself down and you get into that analysis paralysis where it's just never good enough and so one of the things we practice collectively together and be school is progress not Perfection progress not Perfection I consciously try and tell stories about the fact that you know it peaceful now is 10 years old right we've been doing this for a decade but it didn't start out looking or feeling the way it did now just like your best rates right when you said it was that where you are saying people see Rachel Hollis like oh my God she's this phenomenon but if they really pay attention you had real humble beginnings out of your brand did not look the way it did so if you didn't practice progress not Perfection which you did obviously because you're here you would have never gotten to this Superstar level 100% well I do think there's something to eat because they're so many entrepreneurs in the audience and I want you to understand this is not is not an ad this is not be school has been around forever and it is like I know so many people Amy is a dear friend of both of ours cannot Rave enough about the program and I do think there's something like we have to say if you're listening to this and you are an entrepreneur and you've been looking for the thing this is not what the episodes about but will you tell them where they could go to find out more about b-school ohyeah if you just go to Marie forleo B school.com it's not open right now we're not selling it right now we only open the doors once a year which is that happens in like February every single year that's where you can learn more about the program where you can always just right to our team and will tell you whatever you need to know that they'll come and whoever doesn't no worries we love you and that's how it goes that's also I feel like that's a good piece of advice that for those of you who are like looking at 20/20 and you like man this is the air I took the business to the next level Staffing about that and budgeting for that now so that you can start their strong it's a really powerful tool and I know so many people who scaled because of it so not the point but worth saying thank you yeah are you how are you like how quite honestly exists this your first book or am I making that up it was my second so I wrote my first I want to like so long ago like well over a decade ago and I will tell your age I was so kind of nuts card but I was like not enthused by that experience you know I was like I know my audience and they changed my subtitle they change like the cover art I wanted site originally it was first an ebook and again we're going back to like 2003 this is twenty bucks were like mind-blowing regular paper back and then I sold it to McGraw-Hill and that first book is in like 16 languages but I got so honestly I got so swept up and doing all the things we've been doing and having so much fun with Maria TV and we have something called the copy Karen be school in like all the stuff that I didn't really want to write another book until the Oprah talk and that's when I was like yeah I really need to get this out and I'll say this I ran into a friend his name is Toby he's the CEO of Shopify I was like writing in a restaurant here in New York City and honestly I told you this during text you I was like pulling my hair out trying to get it done I was like not an easy process and hope he's like why are you writing book raised like business is going crazy like that's a big project to take on and I told him that's right I said look if I were to step out of this restaurant and get hit by a bus this idea is the one thing I would want to leave behind I think Beyond everything else I've created if I can do a good job communicating this then I feel like I can really really help and so yeah that's why that's why I was just talking to one of my friends about this the other day that he everybody wants to write a book and he's not really sure and I said man a hundred years from now a hundred years from now someone can pick up that book some kid can pick up your book like that's your legacy these are the words that We Leave Behind These are the these are the stories in the tools and frankly I feel like you know God willing and the creek don't rise like this books going to be insane it's going to be a New York Times bestseller everyone's buying it you got to get it immediately if you have listened this far and you're not dying over Marie and her wisdom like stop what you're doing and go grab the book but even if even if 5 people were profoundly Changed by that knowledge and that it gets to live in perpetuity for the rest of time your work is out there in the world that is a gift that so many people do not have will never know because they don't have the courage to try yes yes and look in a hundred years unless something really wild happens we are going to be powder cool that I always like I say that whenever I think about should I say yes to this I'm like you know what hundred years powder yeah yeah exactly right oh man, I'm so excited for you I'm so excited about this book I'm excited about the cover cuz it's beautiful I know that that's a bad thing to say but my goodness you're killing it no real listen I care about I think that especially when it comes to being educated and learning things I think it's nice to have packages that we enjoy looking at I really do it makes a difference if there's something that feels good and I think that's part of great design you know this because you have such great design if something feels good and it creates that energy that's inviting you're like oh what is that you move towards that it opens your heart open your mind so I don't think it's not that I think it matters what the book is available today you can get it anywhere books are sold and all the things did you record the audio book I did I did I did that Sabbath that is absolute like if you and I know a lot of your podcast listeners the audio book with Marie Spitting Fire telling you all the things
