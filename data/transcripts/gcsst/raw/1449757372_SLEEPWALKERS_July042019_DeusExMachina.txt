no it's can run out the one thing that should never run out guaranteed lifetime income in retirement so even though every so love runs out your monthly income in retirement you play on learn more tiaa.org never run out contracts and certificates are issued by teachers insurance and annuity Association of America New York New York Sleepwalkers is a production of iHeartRadio and unusual Productions everyday I go to work I use my car every take I talk to somebody is more than a few feet away I use my phone I'm using certain technologies that extend me beyond my physical normal range so maybe I'm a cyborg that's Sebastian thrun speaking he found a Google X and he's a paid on Sleepwalkers a few times as far as we know he's not a cyborg if everything would have not survived I have no clue but yes I would be pretty miserable you said something which I found that I would love to directly interface my brain to all the computers in the world so I could be truly superhuman I would not everything every name every phone number if it was a button you can press to do that right now we have any hesitation pressing it I would press a microsecond I make a deposit of data I went to college I rent property for five hundred bucks in the time and I paid a scientific theory on the shoulder sweaters that data empowered me to who I am if you took that away from me and said Sebastian I'm going to put you into the China 270z go to work in the field I would be less Bastion that I am today because I would probably know how to plow a field but that's pretty much it to Sebastian's regret that's been a hard limit on how much data he can actually consume is Hardware his physical body has held him back and fortunately the human I owe in property ears and eyes and smelling so invoice a survey in efficient if I could accelerate the the reading of all the books into my brain or my car to be so awesome we told you the Lost episode about brain-computer interfaces in the medical world helping disabled patients like John Schumann move prosthetic limbs with their minds today we look at transhumanism becoming cyborg with computers still function if I drop grade on sauce elves and as we head into this new future who might get left behind by muscle ocean this is Sleepwalkers so carrot Sebastian was talking about cyborgs and whether we're already cyborgs fix my server lines not technology cause and especially our phones we should become kind of like a second brain will be very distracting one technology is required to Keep Us Alive that merger between humans and machines has already happened what people think about when they hear the word cyborgs thinking about more extreme cases like Sebastian having his brain directly connected to all the information in the world ever there are already some people working on that there's this guy named Elon Musk that you might've heard of an actually one of his new companies is called neuralink he's trying to do is create a mesh that can be inserted in the brain that connects the brain to a computer and I think part of his goal is to make humans competitive enough to take on machines if and when they outsmarted us with this idea of humans and machines merging to create something Superior is a great interests throughout Silicon Valley and one person who kind of wrote the book on this transhumanism is Yuval Noah Harari he's a historian at a futurist and deal with her from the day has a book that explores the future of our humanity is a major source of inspiration Ocean City can I leave a fit sport car so excited when he agreed to have a conversation with us is the most important Revolution you better believe the right now we're actually looking at the end of history as we know it the joining of a new era something has changed I wanted to know what we're really deciphering the underlying rules of the game has rules were directed towards that will intervene and change everything to do it really doesn't sound so far-fetched but you've already have it when I look to the heavens are ounces because we ourselves are becoming gods and as technology improves we getting better and better at finding out this is my nephew in woods literally AI Revolution is a revolution coming the computer is also essential review humans If the product of some kind of smart computers will become the car must be able to understand you and be the result of which can be in order to create so many of the Technologies we talked about on Sleepwalkers from self-driving cars to talk adds to parole algorithms we have to assume that human behavior can be modeled but I'll habits routines even up passing out of these could be expressed as a mathematical formulas even if you don't take things that far you valsky point out the transformative potential of combining computer science and biology is shared by people in the business of building a future you may remember off you probably call from earlier in the season on fear and the defense Advanced research projects agency DARPA we're living in a time in which the biological sciences are converging with information technology DARPA we are always looking for these areas where we see the seeds of technological surprise and today I think this intersection of biology with technology is one of the most fertile seed bad for surprise when these advances are coming from the ability to Ulta biology with computer science it may be hot tries to predict what surprises my Bloom you has argued that advances in Ai and Gene editing will lead to new forms of life we are about screen after 4 billion years of evolution slide because even a wildest still subject to Natural Selection and what might come next because it's coming out of our frame of reference is almost like saying what the aliens look like and I need you to watch movies but a movies aliens in this type of extension look remarkably consistent I actually wash Men In Black last week and it is a lien Central Casting you know a lot of representations of cyborg tend to have his element of cliche and there's a pitiable robot the robot the tail by Wally C3PO the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz Wizard of cyborgs already on the show we spoke about John Schumann in the Lost episode using everybody come with her mind but the reset button actually end that in a subsequent experiment Jen through a simulated plane without brain waves remember this research is being funded by DACA and they raised me questions all he probably caught it was running agency in the time by the ethics of transhumanism when Chan went from moving a prosthetic limb to controlling the flight simulator that was the moment that it became visible that these technologies that allow you to restore function by harnessing motor control signals also mean that now we have a way for a human brain to engage with the world in a completely different modalities it was a very eye-opening moment I think for all of us what did you feel in that moment it's creepy it's powerful it makes you realize that as hard as the technology is it might be the easiest part of figuring out how we harness these capabilities for good in the future how to reset this technology remains firmly and research Labs at least for now and each what's is the nearest biologist at the University of Pittsburgh who led the project with Jen and he's very clear that his mission was to restore function not in haunted their idea was can we help paralyzed people coming back from war zones regain function so I think that was very good motivation for the kind of research we are doing and despite the huge potential of Andy's research he's quick to point out that the brain computer interface he built is much less efficient than our existing connection to the world at present our bodies are the best we've got right now if you wanted to control a computer with brain activity it would be 10 times slower that would be if you were typing that your own fingers things move so fast that we've gotten accustomed to the idea that if you see it once it's just going to become pervasive that's actually not true of a medically invasive procedure that involves putting implants on the surface of the brain we're going to need all of that time to figure out what we want to go with these technology so it's a perfect moment to ask where do we want to go to many in Silicon Valley the principal of a more direct interface between humans and computers is enticing but is Sebastian again at this point I don't think customers would love having surgery to get an implant in the brain just believe it's Marta but there are other ways to approach the problem you may remember Google Glass Sebastian letter project when he ran Google X the fact when I first met him in 2012 he was wearing a path because I wanted a camera right next to your eye and Celia so the computer could receive the same sensation the same stuff you see everyday I think these Technologies become closer and closer to us when I first met Sebastian and he was wearing these with Google Glasses Cara a car look like a cyborg and and he told me he might solve the problem of people constantly having to look down at that phone because the information could be at eye level but that really hasn't solved the problem of Technic unsavory under neck fat from looking down at their phones yeah and then there's Turtle posture which is people hunching forward because they're sitting at their computer so much so we don't know if these are going to have an impact on us evolutionarily speaking but I imagine they might or thumbs if you think about it being changed by our phones absolutely fake video that was going around to look out where this guy invented a product or your phone basically had the same camera does except it would face out so you never had to look away from your phone or could just look at your life through your phone which is what everybody already doing well and that was kind of the inside behind Google Glass was what if you could overlay kind of little midget reality over what you saw and there's something very promising cool about it but it wasn't the most reliable because you have to wear something on your face that made you like a cyborg but it took his humors and the benefits of a computer that proximity just weren't enough to make up for the inconvenience of wearing something on that face there is one group of people who are willing to put up with inconvenient technology and people like Jan who had her skull opens that she could move in arm again and mine is about restoring function when we come back after the break we looking too much less invasive technology that has to be as miraculous as Jen Showman's replacing cam one thing we've seen time and again on Sleepwalkers is it automation can change the way we were in powerful ways and when you running your own business or running a show you what to-do list is never-ending you know you could have made many of the tasks you do you don't know how and that's my job here comes in Zapya is the easiest way to automate your work it connects Oroville business software and how those work for you so you can focus on the things that matter most Zakia supports more than 1,500 business applications so the possibilities if I should the endless and best of all it's easy to build the exact solution you needed minutes without writing kodosky developer for help to join more than 4.5 million people who is saving an average of 40 hours per month while using Zapya right now through November try Zapya free like going to a special link zapier.com Sleepwalkers that zapier. Com Sleepwalkers feel free 14-day trial. Yeah. Com Sleepwalkers do you want some set to test it with the San Marino whatever okay that's no way so hot he's an award winning Italian blues guitarist who lives in New York with no I came to play for Julian and I in the studio earlier this year he asked that I meet him at the bus stop I went to Berklee College of Music in Boston to study jazz guitar performance and now he's the real deal will he was at Berkeley he was given the Jimi Hendrix award for being the schools lead guitarist as well as the billboard magazine dad scholarship and now he plays a consistent roster of shows around New York please working to reach a digital fanbases well everyday Noe post a video to help build his audience this is how I found him will you wouldn't know just listening to this podcast is that no way also happens to be blind I was born 3 months early so I put them in the incubator but there was too much oxygen in his infancy know I suffered from retinopathy of prematurity known as ROP he needed surgery to reattach his retinas and now he has very limited Vision totally blind like 100% blind technically I guess it's called light in Shades or something I mean I can see colors I can read really large print only out of one eye but my vision field is small so I still use the K and I still read Braille this is why I asked me to pick him up at the bus stop getting to and from new destinations is a huge pain in the ass but here's the thing there's some companies that are trying to fill the Gap and make smart glasses for people with visual impairments there hope is that with the right technology blindness Tom a thing of the past we were researching for this podcast Julian came across a new technology company after a few months at a pretty day I focus search history right so my Instagram ads started reflect that which is convenient AI helping us make a podcast about AI most advanced sight enhancing glasses for the visually impaired and medical Tech can be pretty expensive but besides recently lowered their prices from $9,500 for a pair of these glasses down to 5950 what do they call that a price so it's still pretty steep but he said as payment plans and health insurance can help people out as well yeah but even sell money on something that is still so experimental still no I was curious to test out a sides technology so I reached out explained know his condition and we got an appointment don't do anything crazy when you put them on that's close to zoo start jumping around like a crazy person Cyclops from X-Men except without the blinding laser beam that shoots out from them the glasses capture high-quality video with a camera above your nose and then project the video to a high-definition screen in front of each eye the footage is enhanced by software designed especially for people with vision impairment you can also Zoom change focus and do things like boost contrast or go to grayscale and he said rap name Nigel help no I get fitted with a pair but it can be a little hard to get used to I mean I'm trying to see isn't it like right here or I should be looking like yes it's right in front of your people a little it's a little high get any better it seems like I got more details out of things but I don't really know what I'm looking at Nigel also asked no way to identify me let's see if you can see it do you know what I look like now I'd like to have a sense of what I look like I mean from what I saw it I was close to be like I've liked light hair like you to light brown or something like that that's right I mean it's cool I just don't know you don't have to see how useful it would actually be like I mean I don't think I will use it to recognize people I got to cuz I would have no way of I don't know what anybody space looks like anyway you know because he has been blind for his entire life no it doesn't have a point of reference for the details in people's faces imagine that you have no idea what any of the people in your life really look like you learn to identify them in other ways like their voice is so ambivalent about the prospect of seeing people clearly but he would like it to be easier to get around recognized in people's faces will not be one of my priorities but reading where the bus stop is when it's coming will be a priority just have to see how it actually practice it will be because I mean when your outside it's not if you have time to stop and figure stuff out especially when you're walking on the sidewalks of New York like I'd rather just be used blindsquare first told me about blindsquare when I picked him up from the bus is the most popular iOS navigation app for blind people it describes the environment you're in the intersection or crossing and announces points of interest all using GPS noise blindsquare to Nigel is it is a tool that he can work with within his set of limitations know he spent his whole life navigating the world one way his way and he said it would actually change that may be more than he would want I've never really seen a subway map anyway so I would have to get a hang of hot worse first and then that's something human beings to comprehend I think it's like imagining a new color right perfect for no I think it's important to know that he state is actually really a cool technology whether or not it worked for him Nigel mentioned that many elderly people suffer from macular degeneration losing their sight due to old age have been able to see their grandchildren for the first time which is really cool I mean it does restore sight for a lot of people who've seen before no I said the sacrifices he makes to get around to his gigs as a blind person aren't so bad but there is one part of his career that's less easy-to-navigate like many musicians Noah uses his social media channels as his primary way of connecting to his current fan and hopefully reaching future ones the problem is it's pretty hard to reach your fans on Instagram if you're blind Instagram needs to listen to me right now basically the issue is this editing videos and putting the part that you want is not accessible on Instagram do you know thankfully the Apple app is accessible so I added it on the iPhone app because there was like sliders and it tells you like current position 0 seconds of like 2 minutes and 30 seconds and so basically you slide with your finger up and down if it wasn't for that I wouldn't be able to post on Instagram I would only be able to post the first minute which is not what I always want to post on the signs and times I posted some other part you know what Instagram has been implemented yet because you know black people are supposed to be on Instagram I never thought about this digital technology is almost exclusively visual I don't think about how easy it is for me to use an iPhone everyday I just use it when you have these Technologies like iPhones being designed by people in Silicon Valley who sit pretty healthily within the norm it's not really doing no way any favors and really focus on the next big thing in Tech we can LeapFrog past uses for these existing technology still weeps a bouquet well where's our next big is unicorn we all need to be is miraculous gigantic ideas subway map so you don't think about things like the blind Square unless we actually need that app we're not Auntie technology or anti unicorn those things are important really funny which is that like he would love a self-driving car of course he would so we all benefit from these moonshot Innovations but it's really important I think that everyone thinks about who is forgotten when we innovate to quickly we don't all benefit in the same way we began this episode debating what defines a cyborg and asking how close we are to being transhuman these are important philosophical questions and they may have become practical questions in our lifetime. As we wrestle with them it's important to remember that huge number of people still don't have access to technology that most of us take for granted to expand our Horizons and what we can do there are billions of people in the world who don't have smartphones and millions of people in the US like know a guy who can take full advantage of them Briny Cole is tackling this problem head-on how to make a Microsoft she founded the future of sex and as part of her work she produces sex take hackathons around the world I think it's so important is because no one's talking about it we all go see it by having sex or sexual identities so I can call to who we are and the concentration of people innovating in this field is quite small so Kara I was a bit nervous to talk about sex in his episode because I know he'll just think we being Sensational for the sake of it but it is an area where we can see the tangible consequences of what happens when one group designs for the rest like with no a I don't think it's Sensational at all it's like with Gillian episode 1 when people programming ads for Facebook do not understand different outcomes for pregnancy they don't know that an outcome for pregnancy could be stillbirth and that's how Gillings ads were making her life worse because if you were programming them and then by and by and large it takes is edge cases like I'm being haunted by Target ads for us to notice that more often than not we don't have account affectionately called make a comparison to a version of technology that wasn't built by Silicon Valley and that is exactly why Brian ecole organizes events to design new sex tech sound really gay key and typically you're going to attract just people involved in technology we're really Kathleen structuring the hex on inviting other people in from other classes from other ethnicities from other agendas to allow us to build different sorts of products what was the surprise that we didn't design for was people with disabilities that showed up with these new groups of people came new kinds of products one team 10 the voice activated vibrator for people in wheelchairs another team in Singapore a diff man a blind man built a sex education platform about a woman back to the dorm room and really not knowing how to read intimacy cues cuz I've never been told these people just showed up on my thank you we feel invisible technology very quickly becomes part of all homeostasis would take for granted the fact that we have a supercomputer as our constant companion and then we can summon the entire Corpus of human knowledge with the flick of a finger at me constantly focus on the next Frontier what's new is easy to forget that many people don't get to share in the fruits of what we've already built out of populations that also has night with the hackathons people in remote areas or rural populations that have trouble finding a mate and of course women which is predominantly who turns out to be a text on its people that typically don't have access to this providing input into how we filled it allow people who feel invisible to create products directly for themselves people who may even be invisible on the campuses of Silicon Valley show briony access begins at the design phase and including new voices can create new products and logical surprises but otherwise might not exist so perhaps a hackathon they could serve as a model for taking Novation more broadly Vice like to see it go is to sort of the trickle-down effect across the world in terms of how that technology reaches other populations cuz it is so concentrated in these like Silicon Valley types it's an access that I'm more excited about we actually have incredible technology available to us and get the uses right now I said clunky with just need to figure out how we can you use it improve Academy fighting Briny paints a picture of world with a benefits of gold light technology spread to other people because we talked about before on Sleepwalkers is a very real possibility that technology will be corrupted by the rich and Powerful so we have to ask who gets to become a cyborg and what if the new Gods didn't want to share that Divinity is Yuval again is there is no different groups of humans are the new cost system differences in wealth and power Homo sapiens split into different species with different capabilities so the descendants of will be a different species Than The Descendants people who not living in Sanford the big question always what is the future of humanity what is our future what is the future of our Humanity what are we sleep walking towards it's tempting to look for the dramatic ways technology is changing us might would be able to physically merge with computers will computer vision help the blind see or the marginalised experience intimacy that big questions but as one that's even more urgent how is the AI Revolution already changing the way we think about and perceive the world what are the algorithms we interact with everyday doing to us and how they changing our society more of those questions with Yuval Noah Harari when we come back Bubba scrub it in my hot water runs out the one thing that should never run out guaranteed lifetime income in retirement so well a good shower eventually runs out your monthly income in retirement should be as comfortable as ever learn more tiaa.org never run out by t i a subject cia's claims being built ETA International Security insurance contract in an investment or federal Securities Law purposes I didn't know it was just how I missed it should have been so obvious but I didn't know an extremely important thing about myself within you know like 2 minutes for Yuval Noah Harari and I could have made a big difference to his early life and Tackle him thinking when we talked about the potential ability but at the same time we also because it's very imperfect to be able to know what is the humans of the understanding of themselves designers of the emotions of the Rings it just needs to know you better than you know yourself because we often don't know the most important things would you have wanted to live in a world where there was sufficiently good sensors to monitor your eyes your eye movement your breathing near why you going about your daily life and then to interpret that and say to you you of all more likely than not you're gay that's a very good question which will become a very practical questions in in a few years and grew up and developed it would have been a bad idea I wouldn't like to receive this kind of insight from for machine when I was 15 gay people at least four people engage in homosexual sex looking to the Future the dangerous by the government's and Coca-Cola Google they already know it could be something else play something by Coca-Cola knowing the time you want to sell me a new drink has the advertisement advertisement and I don't even know what Val suggests is that once we become reducible to data we become predictable to algorithms I'm also predictable we can be manipulated we jumped in the last episode about how AI is helping us decode life's fundamental Mysteries brainwaves Health outcomes based on genetics time of death for the next Frontier could be very behavior is off the again we have tools to evaluate vast volumes of data that we have previously collected her that we've always collected we have new sources of data think about everything from Fitbit spawn of kinds of measurements that you can make on individuals to the volume of data that people are spewing out into the online environment everyday viewing the state runs the internet is where we began the series and knowing that you'll denture is being used to build an accurate model of you make if you pull is about pushing it out that but it's a combination of that day's over the fence is an AI thus allowing us to start to see into the future that deep knowledge now allows you to form hypotheses and to design experiments that allow us now to start a journey of building better models of these complex systems this is at the core of the Revolution that were sing but I think the next wave back starting to understand biology is about a transformation in the social sciences of course in some ways that transformation in the social sciences is already here is what you've always talking about in terms of computers that understand us better than we understand ourselves and we've already seen the real-world consequences altering the course of history with Cambridge analytica brexit the 2016 presidential election but you have believes that was just the beginning on this revolution in biology and computer science will shake the very foundations of how we live experience is the ultimate source of authority and meaning to in the political Authority is the customer is always wrong if the customers want something then how is irrational and logical system is why is it wrong to other people we already distance meaning and the big question is what happens decipher and manipulate crisis which were already beginning to see this crisis is the intersection the combination of many of the ideas that we spoken about on this first season of Sleepwalkers is white so urgently important not to ignore the changes going on around us and to wake up if we just hold on to this liberal belief that humans are free agents we have free will ever be able to understand me you will ever be able to manipulate mean if you really believe that then you are not open to the danger and do you want to be able to reinvent the system the best way not everyone agrees that we've reached a point u-val describes a seat as a world of mystery that we barely begun to penetrate I think we are so far from having a full understanding of any of these systems the fact that we are making this rapid accelerated progress I think sometimes leads to a hyperbolic sense that we're going to know everything and it'll all get reduced to a bunch of algorithms and I don't think we're anywhere near that and I'm not even sure that's the endpoint play the endpoint Beyond. Who is that what it means to be human is so much richer than these mechanistic components that were talking about if he said to me when do you think we will fully map and be able to predict Behavior systems my answer might be never incredible depth of these systems how messy and organic they are music of long way to go before we understood everything the uniqueness of our Humanity lives to fight another day. As you about said they are too profound the influence us it doesn't need a perfect understanding I just need to know a little bit more than we do and it's becoming a reality so what should we do it's more urgent than ever to get to know yourself picture because you have competition once there is somebody out system out that knows you better than you know yourself the game is up you can do something about it not just buy weed holding data but Above All by improving your own understanding of yourself the better you understand yourself the most difficult it is to manipulate you know thyself Yuval reference is the ancient Greek maximum and lost episode Siddhartha Mukherjee cool our attention staff aquatic both in the midst of the incredible upheavals of adenosine to remember the wisdom of the Ancients but how do we get to know ourselves better I meditate some people go to therapy whatever works for you do it and do it quickly I'll get to know yourself better because this is your best protection against being hacked the best thing you can do for your Manatee is billed as individuals and not corporations distance but they serve you what they find to you if I was just like your computer has an auntie virus virus of course one of the problems we talked about on the series is it the vast majority of Townsend Engineers what for the very corporations Yuval says we need to be protected from but there is something compelling about using technology as a tool to protect ourselves from other technology and bryony Cole also sees avenues for technology to help us get to know ourselves best we can explore in Virtual without shame it's pushing us to reveal ourselves even things we didn't even know about us elves if we think about wow this docking Wacky World of sexuality that we haven't even explored us cells because we've been too afraid of what we might discover you put technology in there where you suddenly able to create any real that you want these totally Fantastical edges of our minds that we can go to thanks to technology and according to this is not just about seeking Thrills by something much more profound the korowai humanity we want to connect we want to belong we want to feel like we're part of something that's so does like the cold part of that right down to my sexuality what is the future of sex has nothing to do with technology and it always has to do with being human we can take great strides person need to get to know ourselves better but we will have to recognize the limits of what we can achieve as individuals to create a technological future that is fat and positive we need governance and policy is Yuval again we need to regulate hormones this this is not something you can do by yourself so what seems to be the most important and relevant organization and do it this week Vai resolution isn't far off in the future care of as you Val says it's here with us and we have this personal and political responsibility to make sure the future is a future we want to live in Waco Texas a good place to leave season 1 of Sleepwalkers so go breaking my heart. Incredible to hear you say, Cara people like no way and Gillian brockell or Glenn Rodriguez and to understand how this new technology is affecting people's lives it is been a real privilege to hear those stories you get access to some of the people who building Technologies we live by people like Yasmin green a Google jigsaw the Scioto light show Facebook's head of cyber security and Ben Singleton director of analytics at the NYPD we go to hear first-hand want these leaders in the water technology is thinking about and how hard they wrestle with the ethics of decorations in there so many more areas that we're going to look at season 2 you things like money and climate change and some of the problems that I've noticed even since we started doing this podcast like what happens if your boss is an algorithm well that's why we're doing this season two people can so please join us in the meantime we'll be keeping on Instagram Twitter and website updated Instagram and at Sleepwalkers pot on Twitter and if you have any suggestions or criticisms lotion and we'll see you next time Sleepwalkers is a production of iHeartRadio and unusual productions for the latest interviews and behind-the-scenes footage find us on Instagram at sleepovers podcast OST Focus podcast.
