so we're doing something a little different this week Avery a Ministry of Labour chocolate say hi 1 things about this story in particular is that it's about the process of ideas and how they move to the world correct of an idea from one unexpected place to a kind of other unexpected place and without giving away the whole story it's an episode that I did in 2017 that has become very near and dear to me because of what it's about because it's about where ideas come from and that's something I think about a lot but it's also because the story isn't over it just continues to unfold like the sequence of inspiration is continuing to unfurl and now in the telling of the story we have become a part of it which is a cryptic way of saying that there are updates so we want to play the story that you did just called up on this train going to play pool in the Stream and then we're going to tell you a whole nother story about how this story went out in the world and change the world a little bit more this is 99percentinvisible I'm Roman Mars when people ask us where we get our stories from the answer is usually hard to pin down it could be something one of us noticed walking around or something a friend mentioned some boarded link on Twitter it's nearly impossible to say where inspiration comes from in any art form it's a long way from the seed of an idea to its execution the brilliant architect Alvar aalto put it very well in an extended metaphor about a fish in a stream to erode architecture and its details are in some way all part of biology perhaps they are Princeton's like some big salmon or trout they're not born fully-grown they're not even born in the city or water where they normally live they are born hundreds of miles away from their home grounds where the river is narrow to Tiny streams just as it takes time for us back a fishpond to mature into a fully grown fish so we need time for everything that develops and crystallizes in or world of IDs this is a story about one idea born hundreds of miles away in a far-off stream an idea that would travel from northern Europe to Southern California where it would take on a whole new life before making its way back again is a story in three parts by producer Avery trufelman Heartwood California two skaters in a plaza are confronted by a car it's kind of a Pity that skateboarding is banned in so many places because skateboarders appreciate the small details of architecture more than anyone they recognize the quality of concrete the grain of wood the incline of a structure they recognized the way a landscape flows my name is Jake Phelps Francisco California born and raised yeah what are you got is a skateboarding magazine that skaters called the Bible visiting its headquarters is kind of surreal it's like if you went to a skatepark and yelled at all the pugs hey you guys want to go hang out in an office they're all there and sneakers and beanie caps slumped behind monitors like caged animals you can tell they'd rather be skating, skater I dress like a skater these are the costumes I've been running all of my life I don't wear pink Louis Vuitton clothes and did it to me and I wear sneakers that's don't this just the way it is we were utilitarian we skate it's the greatest thing in the world is 55 years old tattoos all over his arms big thick glasses of his face and close cropped gray hair he blatantly hits on me in the interview and invites me to his punk bands show over the weekend I don't think he'd mind that I told you that Steve Jobs life people always say no can't do that I've been doing this for 40 years you can't tell me I can't do it if you stayed away from me skateboarding is you know it's like an extension of me it's like the heart it's something you have to understand it's your whole you want to see how you how you hold yourself and that is why the view that sort of badass devil-may-care attitude that skaters have perfected that's kind of funny because skateboarding was pretty dorky back when it was just getting started the very first skateboard was called the skateboard scooter and it was a scooter this is Stacy Peralta skateboarding Pioneer and director of the excellent documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys which is all about the birth of modern skateboarding but someone not the handlebars off the scooter and just rode the board and probably emulated surfing and so what happened was skateboarding had a very very brief appearance in 1964 and 65 skateboards were sold in toy stores and skateboarding briefly became a fad but then as quickly as it started it died out again it was like the hula hoop it has come and gone as a skateboard fad is receding into the distance Stacy was growing up in Venice Beach California was the early 70s and Stacy was a little surf rat with long blond hair and when the waves were bad in the middle of the day his friends wanted something to do what we really wanted to do was emulate surfing they wanted to surf on land and they discovered old skateboards one of my friends he's older brothers at skateboarding in the very early sixties and they had two skateboards left in their garage that they never touched so we started riding those boards early skateboards that he's hard clunky wheels made out of clay or steal see you eat dirt if you ran over a pebble or a penny on the ground and that meant tricks had to be very simple like I can stand up straight or I can balance on the tip of the board may be a wheelie you can just kind of scoop back and forth on a flat smooth surface flatland tricks that's basically what you could do since he was really young maybe seven years old but you can remember skating for the first time even with those big clunky clay Wheels little Stacy found a blissful Stillness it was so profound that from that point forward I needed to get back on that board and find that Stillness because I'm more relaxed when I stand on a skateboard that I want to walk but Stacy and his friends were discovering skateboards while the rest of the country was forgetting them Stacy had that old board heat on Earth than his friends garage but after I wore that out there was no more boards to see know that I could buy in store is it just you couldn't buy a skateboard back then so instead Stacy and his friends go to the thrift store and buy a pair of roller skates which had clay or metal or hard plastic wheels and maybe Stacy would take the left skate and his friends would take the right skate and then cut the basis of the wheels and put them are plank of wood and then ride that back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth for hours and the hours that we spent doing it would be equivalent to a kid today you know jumping up and down for 8 hours in a pogo stick every single day 7 days a week and you probably go cheese maybe we should tell this kid that there's no future in this then in the early 70s invention comes along that would revolutionize skateboarding the urethane wheel this soft plastic will have more give to it and held the ground unlike those clunky dangerous clay wheels that preceded it these soft Wheels were intended for roller skaters at the dawn of the roller disco era but a small company called creative urethane begin producing urethane Wheels specifically for skateboards top of the wheels on up here okay the wheels were sold at surf shops since there were no skate shops and they were advertising Surfer magazine. 474 sales of urethane Wheels went gangbusters could grip socks and it allowed us to attack to rain the previously were not we were not able to attack now they could skate all surfaces Greater Los Angeles was there is to claim and so that meant School yards in garages City buildings that it was anyplace anything was rideable but none of this was designed for us none of them he's young kids were jumping fences and trespassing break anything on search of new surfaces ride they were reinterpreting the city around them finding the beauty in the pavement and the concrete of their world and then in the mid-70s there's a drought in California a burro fire as well as Californians Pray For Rain right now that the water company ran billboard ads that encouraged couples to shower together to save water and a further save water people didn't fill up their swimming pools in Los Angeles there are a lot of swimming pools and they're very distinctive-looking but we had in Los Angeles is we had the big beautiful voluptuous shapes that you did not see anywhere else in the world that you find in Los Angeles except in very very very very small quantities the pools of Los Angeles are shaped like peanuts like he holds like kidney bean they have these curved undulating edges they are paved even smooth concrete with gently varying rounded depths that sloped back up to the lip and during the drought in the 70s they were all empty they were perfect they just were so beautifully conceived and designed and we fell in love with the shapes Stacy and his friends would hunt for pools they find a house under construction or Patrol the fancy part of town where they knew they'd find the most Sumptuous luxurious pools Tony they have the fence they break in look up to you guys there's a little bit of old dirty water in the pool they drain it out themselves with buckets they brought or trash cans they found or eventually they bring an industrial vacuum along with them and then they would stay up and down with cool they go so fast they could go up the wall they could skate like they were surfing a wave when we finally got to write swimming pools and feel weightless like going up a vertical wall weightlessness is pretty extraordinary skateboarding became a form of choreography we're trying to do as much as possible in The Limited space of the pool and the graceful while doing it here we were a bunch of Scruffy kids and here we are riding in Backyard Pools and we know what we're doing is beautiful and we get to feel beautiful and this beauty attracted attention back in the first wave of skateboarding in the early 60s there had been a magazine called simply skateboarder it went out of business from the skateboarding fad died out but in the mid-70s the magazine came back and it featured Stacey and his friends riding in backyard pools at that point every cute in America and all over the world wanted to get inside a swimming pool that was there that was the Holy Grail and sold the drought really acted as a wonderful Midwife to the skateboarding Revolution eventually Stacy and the other skateboarders got so good at pool skating they were able to skate up over the edge of the pool their kind of jump up up in the air and maybe do a spin or something before dropping back into the pool I need aerial tricks led to another genre of skateboarding so style became less important and extreme Maneuvers became more important aerial tricks pave the way for the X Games halfpipe send Tony Hawk this whole chapter of the sport where skaters were trying to vote themselves really really high up in the air and that can all be traced back to the rounded biomorphic pools of Los Angeles the ones shaped like peanuts and keyholes and kidney beans La was the backyard pool Mecca but not just the backyard pool Mecca the properly beautifully-designed backyard pool and I don't know of any place in the world that has that proliferation of that kind of voluptuous sensuous design pools of Southern California and their proliferation led to the proliferation of skating everyday people are skating right now people just saw somebody just broke their arm in the pool right now trust me in the pools of California bring us to our next chapter the bean shape has to be in shape but I don't deserve the right any kidney bean shaped esoteric designs of someone's backyard will Jake Phelps doesn't have to be all like that about it but he's right it starts with one esoteric design in someone's backyard but it might be the most famous private backyard in 20th century American history part to Sonoma on top of a remote Hill in Sonoma County in Northern California at the end of a long curvy dirt road the car pulls into a driveway three small dogs rush out to meet the original so you got a little lost. It a little bit Justin fazioli and Sandy Donnell are the owners and caretakers of this property which is known as the done now Garden it's really famous in the world of landscape architecture but if you want to visit it it's kind of a challenge you can't find it on Google Maps that address is wrong and there aren't any public listings or sites with contact information for it because it's just a private home a modest-sized retro modern looking house on a hill it was Sandy's parents place on The Dental Ranch property born in 1951 the youngest of three children the garden was planted in 1948 and it was revolutionary at the time traditional Gardens of the early 20th century had been more or less symmetrical Rosa different kinds of flowers they were kind of like plant museums may be accented with a geometric heads or fruit treat the Donnell Garden is nothing like that it's mostly lawn it's a unifying feature and meanders through everything and it becomes the river the Green River that goes from space to space looks like cut grass with floating islands of tropical plant clusters or groups of rocks in a few ancient oak trees and there are a large swaths of concrete in a big wooden deck from above the garden is almost like a Matisse collage an arrangement of abstract shapes on a green grass canvas and the most distinctive shape of course is the pool oh my God there's the object of your search a kidney from what we know was the first kidney-shaped pool in California as beautiful as I thought actually it is bright pristine electric blue and in the center of the pool is an abstract sculpture by Adeline Kent which has two holes through it one above water and one below and you can swim through the holes in the sculpture like a dolphin and it's insanely fun I know because I tried it cool overlooks Acres of Dusty Ranch and property you can hear the hum of cars on a racetrack off in the distance and you can see the hodgepodge skyline of San Francisco moving hazel-e beyond it I can help us think that a skater would kill to drain this pool it's beautiful it's hard to overstate the importance of the Donnell Garden to build formal landscape architecture and everyday American backyards Sandy Donnell told me that a picture of the garden was in the Encyclopedia Britannica under landscape architecture the property also helped create what we think of as the modern Suburban backyard with the lawn the deck and the pool I would go with you except possibly Versailles that Janelle Garden is probably the most published regarding is least in the 20th century by Thomas Church a landscape architect who wanted to create outdoor spaces that people would use and love the title of Thomas Church is book was actually Gardens are for people for people he asked hypothetical clients how much do you really like to Garden if you don't want a garden that you didn't give me the paving makes a lot of sense Church said that Gardens didn't necessarily have to be those traditional frozen rose of flowers and this was a revelation for modern family is like the dawn else they wanted a place for parties and relaxing lounging they wanted their yard to be a piece of functional art but their kids and dogs could clamber on the Donnell Garden became the epitome of outdoor California lifestyle throughout the 1950s lifestyle magazines like Sunset and house beautiful featured the Donnell Garden on their covers it became the icon certainly of American modern landscape architecture a lot of it being of course that's why we're here for the swimming pool images of the Janelle Garden began to spread newly-minted suburbanite lacrosse Southern California begin to imitate it and West Coast Landscape Architects were inspired by its creative use of Paving and Lawn and it's beautiful biomorphic curvy pool the pool inspired thousands of imitators and eventually thousands of young skaters in Southern California now we can't know for sure exactly where Thomas Church came up with the idea of using the original kidney-shaped retro Boomerang shapes were appearing and everything from Fine Art to mass produce textiles and formica Tables by 1947 the shapes were everywhere you know they were on everything and everywhere so it's really hard to say but there is a really interesting and widespread theory about where Church got his inspiration for the kidney full skateboarding came to my neighborhood like at the end of 1980s we got little bit of flak magazines and videos coming from from the California and seeing part free Avery trufelman actually went to Finland how did you get those videos of the skaters in California the first ones came like when someone's dad went to the states and then they brought back some videos real grew up in Finland watching videos of California skaters and he caught the bug in a big way he started skateboarding and then became sponsored and started skating in cities all over the world Through Skateboarding I fell in love with architecture and design University and studied architecture in part to have more control over the space as he skated I'll just like sneak into that business and I won't tell anyone that I'm scared and just make sure that the and really scared of the stairs that would give good material sand and trips in architecture school Jana distinctly remembers a lecture he heard about the origins of the kidney pool there was a professor of coming from California she was having less talking about the Donnell Garden I think she was saying that it's the mother of all kidney pools mother of whirlpools is in Finland the middle of Finland as designed by an architect and designer named all of our Alto and sativa vs. Pioneer in a cross-disciplinary sinking and design this is Auntie Oliver and Architects and vice president of Alto University which is named after Oliver although he designed the marvelous furniture and also he had a flourishing business is the man in Finland there a bus to him everywhere he designed a lot of the public and government buildings in meeting halls in Helsinki and Oliver Altos Furniture is in I kid you not almost every single building something behind also his beloved and venerated Beyond Finland to Frank Lloyd Wright loved Alto and he hated other Architects Frank gehry also cites also is one of the only other Architects that he admires overall toe Was An Architect architect at his work helped create a unique vintage aesthetic which was an important part of developing a unique finish identity because Finland is a relatively Young country was first for about 500 years part of Sweden and then for 100 years part of Russia movie theaters in California that are older than it was only in 1917 that's Inland became independent before that it was a Russian and it looks like it the architecture in downtown Helsinki is unexpectedly Regal intimidating the buildings line the streets like towering pastel cakes with white ornate trim Helsinki has stood in for Moscow and Leningrad and a number of films at the end of 19th century became very important to create a national identity and try to get independent Dylan wanted to step away from Soviet Romanticism especially because the rest of Europe was experimenting with a new approach called functionalism functionalism was a reaction to the dirty nasty polluted cities of the 19th century which were loaded down with extra trim and ornaments and statues of functionalism was like an architectural cleanse launch always wanted to be here between buildings it was fresh and steel and metal of the German Bauhaus or the pristine concrete of Le corbusier functionalism is clean geometric Stark spacious modern and a little sterile so also was influenced by functionalist ideas but wanted to humanize them Pisces and making his own gracious and functional natural and organic and he did this in part by using a lot of wood he made would behave in ways for architect an art historian with the alto Foundation where are we can you describe where we are on house and also the office was made and talked about Altos patented method for bending and curving would this method allowed also to make curvy molds to make these wavy glass vases that he became famous for its own and make it a bit different than any new shapes for it curves made their way into Altos stairways and walls and he made curtain partitions to break up space and he used rounded tile undulating countertops made cuz he could like he figured out how to do it and he was just getting with it to be kind of something to cancel you predict an art collector and lumber Eros nimri gullikson asked alter to design her country home The Villa mairea also wanted to keep it very start and clean also very friendly and natural and we don't have it just do it in the floor some Frederick on the wall we don't have any any material let's go to be Posh but of course in Finland if you're going to have a Country Villa you're going to have a sauna finish both spending some time in the countryside it's fine if you're going to have a sauna you need a pool to cool off in an Oliver Alto made a pool with a very curious shape maybe a sock is it curvy end The Story Goes that Thomas Church a California landscape architect who designed the Danelle Garden went on a trip to Finland with his wife Betsy in 1937 somehow they found out the address at Alvar aalto is home and studio and got themselves there and they just knocked on the door architectural historian Mark try it again when The Story Goes also came out in his bathrobe and invited them in and said Thomas Church and his wife Betsy and Xarelto and its first wife I know all really hit it off and I got to be good friends and it is quite possibly the case that Altos design for the villa mairea and Itzhak shaped pool or displayed in his Studio when Thomas Church was visiting but they were there in 37 maybe it was on the drawing boards and maybe there was no pool at the time I mean we just just don't know there's no way to verify it but that's the story Architects tell if there's a book about the Donnell Garden it's probably going to have a mention of Villa mairea The Story Goes that's almost Church went back home then it was 1948 when the Donnell Garden was made so almost Ten Years After and then the Danelle Garden Pool becomes famous pairing on magazine covers and inspiring hundreds of imitators across Southern California and he's hundreds of curvy biomorphic pools get emptied out in the drought in the 1970s inspired a whole new skate culture and that culture inspired kids around the world like Jana to take up skateboarding and skateboarding inspired Jana to become an architect and now he has a specialty I'm going to the skatepark Tucson already feeling he designs curvaceous pools all over Europe pools exclusively for skin that's one big pool coming to the east side of Hell thinking it it's it's not really nice figuring that's something to be proud of who I think he's proud he means that public skate parks and skate pools should be a source of civic pride especially in Finland where likes to tease modern skateboarding began I kind of use it as a joke when when we are out with Skate Park Builder spell usual from States or Canada and try to claim skateboarding for having its roots in Finland some say that Oliver Altos pool at the Villa mairea was inspired by the soft Benz in a finished lake or maybe I'll do I was just excited about his ability to make wavy forms since that kind of became his signature and furniture and homewares who knows maybe he was inspired by a some other Kirby pool somewhere else in the world that we don't know about also didn't like to talk about his inspiration he didn't write too much about it either although only talked about the birth of his ideas in an extended metaphor about a fish in a stream or those are in some way all part of biology perhaps they are for instance like some big salmon or trout they're not born fully-grown they're not even born in the sea or water where they normally live their Board of hundreds of miles away from their home grounds where the river is narrow to Tiny streams just as it takes time for a speck of fish spawn to mature into a fully grown fish so we need time for everything that develops and crystallizes in our world of ideas cute Jake Phelps the editor of

Org. So we're back in the present time in the studio with Avery and so what is the update on this story as we said before this is a story about the unexpected connections between things and the thing is the story seems to keep going on and on even two years after it came out because I was just talking to this guy Jonathan nesci he's a Furniture lighting an exhibition designer and he listened to the pool in the Stream when it came out back in 2017 CBR F4i oldest son who skateboards who is in 14 he should start on his senior project now of a new skatepark which I thought was like what a crazy idea you know they're not even in high school yet it's actually a great idea for a senior project though there's already a skatepark in their town which was built as a senior project back in 1999 and their Jonathan poked around a bit and look into what was going on with this skate park inside that I was just about to form for the parks department for a renovation of a skatepark in Columbus Columbus Indiana that's where Jonathan lives you know about Columbus Indiana to Columbus Indiana because you have a show about architecture and design it's this unexpected epicenter of modern design yeah it's amazing exactly it's the small city of 27,000 people but it's full of soaring statuesque modernist buildings by some of the most canonical architects of the 20th century you would think with 85 significant works of architecture it would be a high brow place but it's just so everyday and Civic it's not like the cool thing is it's all the public buildings every fire station and police station and Elementary Middle High School junior colleges they're all done by significant Architects Kevin Roche to Robert Venturi and Paul Canon printer burkitt's season and you might think that this would be a town full of architecture nerds and useless hipsters like me but it's very blue collar working class but there's a high concentration of Engineers because of the automotive fields and also because of the automotive industry at Columbus is a very diverse town because there here's an employee's from all over the world and then the engine wink of Columbus is a corporation called Cummins it's a Fortune 500 company that designs and manufactures and distributes engines and they work with the Nissan and John Deere and Dodge and a hundred years ago but this old banking family in Columbus the family chauffeur was tinkering and perfected the diesel engines his name is Clancy Cummins Cummins was a farm boy who stops growing at 8 grade but clearly he was a talented mechanic the wealthy family he work for and they're patriarch the industrialist Joseph Irwin Miller bankrolled an engine company and clessie Cummins their chauffeur became the CEO in the late thirties of a Civic gift to the town go to beautify and also to attract Talent the industrialist Miller decided to give his little city a beautiful new church fateful thing was who they got to design the church came up and that change the course of the city is a massive deal when I was in Finland the two big names that came over and over again or eliel Saarinen and Alvar aalto like rain was post-war Saturday and was early turn of the last century and while also did that kind of natural modernism style eliel Saarinen did these Regal Nouveau style buildings with stone and copper patina like he designed the Grand Central Helsinki train station and then I will turn and move to the United States in the twenties and settled in the midwest he's a professor at the University of Michigan and here in the states eliel is just as famous for his buildings as he is for his son because he was the father of exactly like when they're talking about how he did the St Louis Arch the old TWA terminal at Newark JFK airport he designed the famous tulip chair made of white plastic and red cushioning he's huge he's like a master of the 20th century and so when eliel Saarinen build a simple geometric Limestone Church in 1942 in Columbus Indiana Eero Saarinen got roped in 64 also built the conference center in town and a private house for the wealthy Miller family like his fingerprints are all over Columbus Indiana and then after Arrow passed away all the architects in his office went and did work in Columbus and it spread from there like in Columbus Indiana I am paid at the library Edward Charles Bassett of Skidmore Owings & Merrill did the city hall Columbus basically became an institution of hiring eliel Saarinen and the the chain of events that happened which is also so funny that just like the pool in the street and like that story starts in Finland so you can imagine kind of intimidating to build something in a town full of wildly impressive architecture by Jonathan wanted to be part of the process a lot of sessions about what this is going to be like three recreate this exactly the way it was and then your podcast came I just looked it up July 4th Seventeen and then I reached out to me on July 27th to the Finish skatepark designer in the story because of our episode Jana became the designer of the skatepark in Columbus and pairing him with the local skate Park Builder where everyone on the team skateboards the owners of the company skateboard and their troweling concrete it's it's like there's two so much heart and passion beautiful the park the park almost looks like ocean waves people love it yesterday with fruits of their labor together actually the skatepark has convinced Jonathan to pick up his BMX bike again years left of them being in the house what are kind of on the way to have them see an idea and then see the steps that it takes to realize that idea what the story is All About where ideas come from and where they travel I mean who knows who will go to the park in the years to come and discover new friends or new community or New Passion and move the chain of inspiration for word from their of everything that ever have been part of this by far by the most meaningful just playing at connector you know I do know it's an amazing thing I feel so lucky to be a part of this story like making making these connections is the best part of my job so cool farther like we could have talked about the origins of Surfing and it could have gone forward into the future because film changed when all the skate kid started picking up cameras and they change the way the tracking shot works in cinema like the story goes off in all these different directions but the fact that also manifested in this literal concrete example in Columbus Indiana is just gorgeous I love

pugs hey you guys want to go hang out in an office they're all there and sneakers and beanie caps slumped behind monitors like caged animals you can tell they'd rather be skating, skater I dress like a skater these are the costumes I've been running all of my life I don't wear pink Louis Vuitton clothes and did it to me and I wear sneakers that's don't this just the way it is we were utilitarian we skate it's the greatest thing in the world is 55 years old tattoos all over his arms big thick glasses of his face and close cropped gray hair he blatantly hits on me in the interview and invites me to his punk bands show over the weekend I don't think he'd mind that I told you that Steve Jobs life people always say no can't do that I've been doing this for 40 years you can't tell me I can't do it if you stayed away from me skateboarding is you know it's like an extension of me it's like the heart it's something you have to understand it's your whole you want to see how you how you hold yourself and that is why the view that sort of badass devil-may-care attitude that skaters have perfected that's kind of funny because skateboarding was pretty dorky back when it was just getting started the very first skateboard was called the skateboard scooter and it was a scooter this is Stacy Peralta skateboarding Pioneer and director of the excellent documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys which is all about the birth of modern skateboarding but someone not the handlebars off the scooter and just rode the board and probably emulated surfing and so what happened was skateboarding had a very very brief appearance in 1964 and 65 skateboards were sold in toy stores and skateboarding briefly became a fad but then as quickly as it started it died out again it was like the hula hoop it has come and gone as a skateboard fad is receding into the distance Stacy was growing up in Venice Beach California was the early 70s and Stacy was a little surf rat with long blond hair and when the waves were bad in the middle of the day his friends wanted something to do what we really wanted to do was emulate surfing they wanted to surf on land and they discovered old skateboards one of my friends he's older brothers at skateboarding in the very early sixties and they had two skateboards left in their garage that they never touched so we started riding those boards early skateboards that he's hard clunky wheels made out of clay or steal see you eat dirt if you ran over a pebble or a penny on the ground and that meant tricks had to be very simple like I can stand up straight or I can balance on the tip of the board may be a wheelie you can just kind of scoop back and forth on a flat smooth surface flatland tricks that's basically what you could do since he was really young maybe 7 years old but you can remember skating for the first time even with those big clunky clay Wheels little Stacy found a blissful Stillness it was so profound that from that point forward I needed to get back on that board and find that Stillness because I'm more relaxed when I stand on a skateboard that I want to walk but Stacy and his friends were discovering skateboards while the rest of the country was forgetting them Stacy had that old board here on Earth than his friends garage but after I wore that out there was no more boards to see know that I could buy in store is it just you couldn't buy a skateboard back then instead go to the thrift store and buy a pair of roller skates which had clay or metal or hard plastic wheels and maybe Stacy would take the left skate and his friends would take the right skate and then cut the basis of the wheels and put them are plank of wood and then ride that back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth for hours and the hours that we spent doing it would be equivalent to a kid today you know jumping up and down for 8 hours in a pogo stick every single day 7 days a week and you probably go cheese maybe we should tell this kid that there's no future in this then in the early 70s invention comes along that would revolutionize skateboarding the urethane wheel this soft plastic will have more give to it and held the ground unlike those clunky dangerous clay wheels that preceded it these soft Wheels were intended for roller skaters at the dawn of the roller disco era but a small company called creative urethane begin producing urethane Wheels specifically for skateboards top of the wheels on up here okay the wheels were sold at surf shops since there were no skate shops and they were advertising Surfer magazine. 474 sales of urethane Wheels went gangbusters could grip socks and it allowed us to attack to rain the previously were not we were not able to attack now they could skate all surfaces Greater Los Angeles was there is to claim and so that meant School yards in garages City buildings that it was anyplace anything was rideable but none of this was designed for us none of them he's young kids were jumping fences and trespassing break anything on search of new surfaces ride they were reinterpreting the city around them finding the beauty in the pavement and the concrete of their world and then in the mid-70s there's a drought in California a burro fire as well as Californians Pray For Rain right now that the water company ran billboard ads that encouraged couples to shower together to save water and a further save water people didn't fill up their swimming pools in Los Angeles there are a lot of swimming pools and they're very distinctive-looking but we had in Los Angeles is we had the big beautiful voluptuous shapes that you did not see anywhere else in the world that you find in Los Angeles except in very very very very small quantities the pools of Los Angeles are shaped like peanuts like he holds like kidney bean they have these curved undulating edges they are paved even smooth concrete with gently varying rounded depths that sloped back up to the lip and during the drought in the 70s they were all empty they were perfect they just were so beautifully conceived and designed and we fell in love with the shapes Stacy and his friends would hunt for pools they find a house under construction or Patrol the fancy part of town where they knew they'd find the most Sumptuous luxurious pools Tony they have the fence they break in look up to you guys there's a little bit of old dirty water in the pool they drain it out themselves with buckets they brought or trash cans they found or eventually they bring an industrial vacuum along with them and then they would stay up and down with cool they go so fast they could go up the wall they could skate like they were surfing a wave when we finally got to write swimming pools and feel weightless like going up a vertical wall weightlessness is pretty extraordinary skateboarding became a form of choreography we're trying to do as much as possible in The Limited space of the pool and the graceful while doing it here we were a bunch of Scruffy kids and here we are riding in Backyard Pools and we know what we're doing is beautiful and we get to feel beautiful and this beauty attracted attention back in the first wave of skateboarding in the early 60s there had been a magazine called simply skateboarder it went out of business from the skateboarding fad died out but in the mid-70s the magazine came back and it featured Stacey and his friends riding in backyard pools at that point every cute in America and all over the world wanted to get inside a swimming pool that was there that was the Holy Grail and sold the drought really acted as a wonderful Midwife to the skateboarding Revolution eventually Stacy and the other skateboarders got so good at pool skating they were able to skate up over the edge of the pool their kind of jump up up in the air and maybe do a spin or something before dropping back into the pool I need aerial tricks led to another genre of skateboarding so style became less important and extreme Maneuvers became more important aerial tricks pave the way for the X Games halfpipe send Tony Hawk this whole chapter of the sport where skaters were trying to vote themselves really really high up in the air and that can all be traced back to the rounded biomorphic pools of Los Angeles the ones shaped like peanuts and keyholes and kidney beans La was the backyard pool Mecca but not just the backyard pool Mecca the properly beautifully-designed backyard pool and I don't know of any place in the world that has that proliferation of that kind of voluptuous sensuous design pools of Southern California and their proliferation led to the proliferation of skating everyday people are skating right now people just saw somebody just broke their arm in the pool right now trust me in the pools of California bring us to our next chapter the bean shape has to be in shape but I don't deserve the right any kidney bean shaped esoteric designs of someone's backyard will Jake Phelps doesn't have to be all like that about it but he's right it starts with one esoteric design in someone's backyard but it might be the most famous private backyard in 20th century American history part to Sonoma on top of a remote Hill in Sonoma County in Northern California at the end of a long curvy dirt road the car pulls into a driveway three small dogs rush out to meet the original so you got a little lost it a little bit Justin fazioli and Sandy Donnell are the owners and caretakers of this property which is known as the done now Garden it's really famous in the world of landscape architecture but if you want to visit it it's kind of a challenge you can't find it on Google Maps that address is wrong and there aren't any public listings or sites with contact information for it because it's just a private home a modest-sized retro modern looking house on a hill it was Sandy's parents place on The Dental Ranch property born in 1951 the youngest of three children the garden was planted in 1948 and it was revolutionary at the time traditional Gardens of the early 20th century had been more or less symmetrical Rosa different kinds of flowers they were kind of like plant museums may be accented with a geometric heads or fruit treat the Donnell Garden is nothing like that it's mostly lawn it's a unifying feature and meanders through everything and it becomes the river the Green River that goes from space to space looks like cut grass with floating islands of tropical plant clusters or groups of rocks in a few ancient oak trees and there are a large swaths of concrete in a big wooden deck from above the garden is almost like a Matisse collage an arrangement of abstract shapes on a green grass canvas and the most distinctive shape of course is the pool oh my God there's the object of your search a kidney from what we know was the first kidney-shaped pool in California as beautiful as I thought actually it is bright pristine electric blue and in the center of the pool is an abstract sculpture by Adeline Kent which has two holes through it one above water and one below and you can swim through the holes in the sculpture like a dolphin and it's insanely fun I know because I tried it cool overlooks Acres of Dusty Ranch and property you can hear the hum of cars on a racetrack off in the distance and you can see the hodgepodge skyline of San Francisco moving hazel-e beyond it I can help us think that a skater would kill to drain this pool it's beautiful it's hard to overstate the importance of the Donnell Garden to build formal landscape architecture and everyday American backyards Sandy Donnell told me that a picture of the garden was in the Encyclopedia Britannica under landscape architecture the property also helped create what we think of as the modern Suburban backyard with the lawn the deck and the pool I would go with you except possibly Versailles that Janelle Garden is probably the most published regarding is least in the 20th century by Thomas Church a landscape architect who wanted to create outdoor spaces that people would use and love the title of Thomas Church is book was actually Gardens are for people for people he asked hypothetical clients how much do you really like to Garden if you don't want a garden that you didn't give me the paving makes a lot of sense Church said that Gardens didn't necessarily have to be those traditional frozen rose of flowers and this was a revelation for modern family is like the dawn else they wanted a place for parties and relaxing lounging they wanted their yard to be a piece of functional art but their kids and dogs could clamber on the Donnell Garden became the epitome of outdoor California lifestyle throughout the 1950s lifestyle magazines like Sunset and house beautiful featured the Donnell Garden on their covers it became the icon certainly of American modern landscape architecture a lot of it being of course that's why we're here for the swimming pool images of the Janelle Garden began to spread newly-minted suburbanite lacrosse Southern California begin to imitate it and West Coast Landscape Architects were inspired by its creative use of Paving and Lawn and it's beautiful biomorphic curvy pool the pool inspired thousands of imitators and eventually thousands of young skaters in Southern California now we can't know for sure exactly where Thomas Church came up with the idea of using the original kidney-shaped retro Boomerang shapes were appearing and everything from Fine Art to mass produce textiles and formica Tables by 1947 the shapes were everywhere you know they were on everything and everywhere so it's really hard to say but there is a really interesting and widespread theory about where Church got his inspiration for the kidney full skateboarding came to my neighborhood like at the end of 1980s we got little bit of flak magazines and videos coming from from the California and seeing part free Avery trufelman actually went to Finland how did you get those videos of the skaters in California the first ones came like when someone's dad went to the states and then they brought back some videos real grew up in Finland watching videos of California skaters and he caught the bug in a big way he started skateboarding and then became sponsored and started skating in cities all over the world Through Skateboarding I fell in love with architecture and design University and studied architecture in part to have more control over the space as he skated I'll just like sneak into that business and I won't tell anyone that I'm scared and just make sure that the and really scared of the stairs that would give good material sand and trips in architecture school Jana distinctly remembers a lecture he heard about the origins of the kidney pool there was a professor of coming from California she was having less talking about the Donnell Garden I think she was saying that it's the mother of all kidney pools mother of whirlpools is in Finland the middle of Finland as designed by an architect and designer named all of our Alto and sativa vs. Pioneer in a cross-disciplinary sinking and design this is Auntie Oliver and Architects and vice president of Alto University which is named after Oliver although he designed the marvelous furniture and also he had a flourishing business is the man in Finland there a bus to him everywhere he designed a lot of the public and government buildings in meeting halls in Helsinki and Oliver Altos Furniture is in I kid you not almost every single building something behind also his beloved and venerated Beyond Finland to Frank Lloyd Wright loved Alto and he hated other Architects Frank gehry also cites also is one of the only other Architects that he admires overall toe Was An Architect architect at his work helped create a unique vintage aesthetic which was an important part of developing a unique finish identity because Finland is a relatively Young country was first for about 500 years part of Sweden and then for 100 years part of Russia movie theaters in California that are older than it was only in 1917 that's Inland became independent before that it was a Russian and it looks like it the architecture in downtown Helsinki is unexpectedly Regal intimidating the buildings line the streets like towering pastel cakes with white ornate trim Helsinki has stood in for Moscow and Leningrad and a number of films at the end of 19th century became very important to create a national identity and try to get independent Dylan wanted to step away from Soviet Romanticism especially because the rest of Europe was experimenting with a new approach called functionalism functionalism was a reaction to the dirty nasty polluted cities of the 19th century which were loaded down with extra trim and ornaments and statues of functionalism was like an architectural cleanse launch always wanted to be here between buildings it was fresh and steel and metal of the German Bauhaus or the pristine concrete of Le corbusier functionalism is clean geometric Stark spacious modern and a little sterile so also was influenced by functionalist ideas but wanted to humanize them Pisces and making his own gracious and functional natural and organic and he did this in part by using a lot of wood he made would behave in ways for architect an art historian with the alto Foundation where are we can you describe where we are on house and also the office was made and talked about Altos patented method for bending and curving would this method allowed also to make curvy molds to make these wavy glass vases that he became famous for its own and make it a bit different than any new shapes for it curves made their way into Altos stairways and walls and he made curtain partitions to break up space and he used rounded tile undulating countertops made cuz he could like he figured out how to do it and he was just getting with it to be kind of something to cancel you predict an art collector and lumber Eros nimri gullikson asked alter to design her country home The Villa mairea also wanted to keep it very start and clean also very friendly and natural and we don't have it just do it in the floor some Frederick on the wall we don't have any any material let's go to be Posh but of course in Finland if you're going to have a Country Villa you're going to have a sauna finish both spending some time in the countryside it's fine if you're going to have a sauna you need a pool to cool off in an Oliver Alto made a pool with a very curious shape maybe a sock is it curvy end The Story Goes that Thomas Church a California landscape architect who designed the Danelle Garden went on a trip to Finland with his wife Betsy in 1937 somehow they found out the address at Alvar aalto is home and studio and got themselves there and they just knocked on the door architectural historian Mark try it again when The Story Goes also came out in his bathrobe and invited them in and said Thomas Church and his wife Betsy and Xarelto and its first wife I know all really hit it off and I got to be good friends and it is quite possibly the case that Altos design for the villa mairea and Itzhak shaped pool or displayed in his Studio when Thomas Church was visiting but they were there in 37 maybe it was on the drawing boards and maybe there was no pool at the time I mean we just just don't know there's no way to verify it but that's the story Architects tell if there's a book about the Donnell Garden it's probably going to have a mention of Villa mairea The Story Goes that's almost Church went back home then it was 1948 when the Donnell Garden was made so almost Ten Years After and then the Danelle Garden Pool becomes famous pairing on magazine covers and inspiring hundreds of imitators across Southern California and he's hundreds of curvy biomorphic pools get emptied out in the drought in the 1970s inspired a whole new skate culture and that culture inspired kids around the world like Jana to take up skateboarding and skateboarding inspired Jana to become an architect and now he has a specialty I'm going to the skatepark Tucson already feeling he designs curvaceous pools all over Europe pools exclusively for skin that's one big pool coming to the east side of Hell thinking it it's it's not really nice figuring that's something to be proud of who I think he's proud he means that public skate parks and skate pools should be a source of civic pride especially in Finland where likes to tease modern skateboarding began I kind of use it as a joke when when we are out with Skate Park Builder spell usual from States or Canada and try to claim skateboarding for having its roots in Finland some say that Oliver Altos pool at the Villa mairea was inspired by the soft Benz in a finished lake or maybe I'll do I was just excited about his ability to make wavy forms since that kind of became his signature and furniture and homewares who knows maybe he was inspired by a some other Kirby pool somewhere else in the world that we don't know about also didn't like to talk about his inspiration he didn't write too much about it either although only talked about the birth of his ideas in an extended metaphor about a fish in a stream or those are in some way all part of biology perhaps they are for instance like some big salmon or trout they're not born fully-grown they're not even born in the sea or water where they normally live their Board of hundreds of miles away from their home grounds where the river is narrow to Tiny streams just as it takes time for a speck of fish spawn to mature into a fully grown fish so we need time for everything that develops and crystallizes in our world of ideas cute Jake Phelps the editor of Thrasher magazine passed away in March of 2019 kyrat 99percentinvisible we think about the design you don't always notice when it

Org. So we're back in the present time in the studio with Avery and so what is the update on this story as we said before this is a story about the unexpected connections between things and the thing is the story seems to keep going on and on even two years after it came out because I was just talking to this guy Jonathan nesci he's a Furniture lighting and exhibition designer and he listened to the pool in the Stream when it came out back in 2017 CBR F4i oldest son who skateboards who is in 14 he should start on his senior project now of a new skatepark which I thought was like what a crazy idea you know they're not even in high school yet it's actually a great idea for a senior project though there's already a skatepark in their town which was built as a senior project back in 1999 and their Jonathan poke around a bit and look into what was going on with this skatepark was just about to form for the parks department for a renovation of a skatepark in Columbus Columbus Indiana that's where Jonathan lives you know about Columbus Indiana to Columbus Indiana because you have a show about architecture and design it's this unexpected epicenter of modern design yeah it's amazing exactly it's the small city of 27,000 people but it's full of soaring statuesque modernist buildings by some of the most canonical architects of the 20th century you would think with 85 significant works of architecture it would be a high brow place but it's just so everyday and Civic it's not like the cool thing is it's all the public buildings every fire station and police station and Elementary Middle High School junior colleges they're all done by significant Architects Kevin Roche to Robert Venturi and Paul Canon printer burkitt's season and you might think that this would be a town full of architecture nerds and useless hipsters like me but it's very blue collar working class but there's a high concentration of Engineers because of the automotive fields and also because of the automotive industry at Columbus is a very diverse town because there here's an employee's from all over the world and then the engine wink of Columbus is a corporation called Cummins it's a Fortune 500 company that designs and manufactures and distributes engines and they work with the Nissan and John Deere and Dodge and a hundred years ago but this old banking family in Columbus the family chauffeur was tinkering and perfected the diesel engines his name is Clancy Cummins Cummins was a farm boy who stops growing at 8 grade but clearly he was a talented mechanic the wealthy family he work for and they're patriarch the industrialist Joseph Irwin Miller bankrolled an engine company and clessie Cummins their chauffeur became the CEO in the late thirties of a Civic gift to the town go to beautify and also to attract Talent the industrialist Miller decided to give his little city a beautiful new church fateful thing was who they got to design the church came up and that change the course of the city is a massive deal when I was in Finland the two big names that came over and over again or eliel Saarinen and Alvar aalto like rain was post-war Saturday and was early turn of the last century and while also did that kind of natural modernism style eliel Saarinen did these Regal Nouveau style buildings with stone and copper patina like he designed the Grand Central Helsinki train station and then I will turn and move to the United States in the twenties and settled in the midwest he's a professor at the University of Michigan and here in the states eliel is just as famous for his buildings as he is for his son because he was the father of exactly like when they're talking about how he did the St Louis Arch the old TWA terminal at Newark JFK airport he designed the famous tulip chair made of white plastic and red cushioning he's huge he's like a master of the 20th century and so when eliel Saarinen build a simple geometric Limestone Church in 1942 in Columbus Indiana Eero Saarinen got roped in 64 also built the conference center in town and a private house for the wealthy Miller family like his fingerprints are all over Columbus Indiana and then after Arrow passed away all the architects in his office went and did work in Columbus and it spread from there like in Columbus Indiana I am paid at the library Edward Charles Bassett of Skidmore Owings & Merrill did the city hall Columbus basically became an institution of hiring eliel Saarinen and the the chain of events that happened which is also so funny that just like the pool in the street and like that story starts in Finland so you can imagine kind of intimidating to build something in a town full of wildly impressive architecture by Jonathan wanted to be part of the process a lot of sessions about what this is going to be like three recreate this exactly the way it was and then your podcast came I just looked it up July 4th Seventeen and then I reached out to me on July 27th to the Finish skatepark designer in the story because of our episode Jana became the designer of the skatepark in Columbus and pairing him with the local skate Park Builder where everyone on the team skateboards the owners of the company skateboard and their troweling concrete it's it's like there's two so much heart and passion beautiful the park the park almost looks like ocean waves people love it yesterday with fruits of their labor together actually the skatepark has convinced Jonathan to pick up his BMX bike again years left of them being in the house what are kind of on the way to have them see an idea and then see the steps that it takes to realize that idea what the story is All About where ideas come from and where they travel I mean who knows who will go to the park in the years to come and discover new friends or new community or New Passion and move the chain of inspiration for word from their of everything that ever have been part of this by far by the most meaningful just playing at connector you know I do know it's an amazing thing I feel so lucky to be a part of this story like making making these connections is the best part of my job so cool farther like we could have talked about the origins of Surfing and it could have gone forward into the future because film changed when all the skate kid started picking up cameras and they change the way the tracking shot works in cinema like the story goes off in all these different directions but the fact that also manifested in this literal concrete example in Columbus Indiana is just gorgeous I love
