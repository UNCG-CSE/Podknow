figured out by the time we're in our thirties when I think we do know we don't hang it we definitely don't especially sitting next to her I guess today you guys I'm in love but we're both in love with our guest I was bored she is an amazing podcast ologies apologies which is so great it's the study of all the thing all the things and she knows facts about everything about everything she's very intelligent she's whip-smart very funny yeah she's got this podcast celebrated their hundred episode she basically every week has a new expert on on a whole bunch of things like the trees and when lizards apparently all kinds of fun stuff but not only that she is an Emmy award-winning science correspondent for CBS has the Henry Ford's Innovation Nation with marrocco and host of did I mention invention on the CW she also appears on Netflix's science series called brainchild andscience Channel's how to build everything so basically Making Science sexy again yes she is she's bringing sexy science back I'm doing it well so stay tuned we have the best interview with Ally Ward coming up and back ready for the study of Alie Ward so that bialy wordology Pieology I'll take it I mean I try not to make too many up but if we can get it somewhere excited and in some paperwork ology the thing I'll take it your hundred episode of ologies a hundred episode so many episodes do you remember the mall Road Suite A quoted me I'll be like so yeah it's a lot of hours it's a lot of days I went without washing my hair a lot a lot of work but I love every second we had like such a really fun career exploring topics and conversations that I think you stop exploring when you're not in school anymore which is already a dream but then on top of that too then pursue a podcast where you get to really do a deep dive on specific topics that you're fascinated by what inspired you to do that I was just always very super super curious like I got insect guides when I was a kid like for Christmas and and my birthday I always want like more bug guides always loved bugs and just want my sister my sister was seven years I choose scissors they're the most opposite people ever like this has nothing to do with ologies I don't know why I'm telling the story but I'm going to like formative years so like at his two sisters one of them is like in the heavy metal her husband is a heavy metal guitarist for like hardcore bands were he's like play stadiums in Europe and her daddy was a sound like a Flying V guitar they got married in all black of the courthouse and I have another sister who was super religious and is married to an Evangelical Christian pastor since I haven't really super different sister and then you said you somewhere in the middle of the things I was talking to my sisters and we all think that were the one that's in between the other two but my heavy metal sister she was dating this guy when she was like you know like 20 or something that was a heavy metal dude who is also an entomologist and so he would come to pick her up and she always be like Hairspray your hair and stuff for a couple hours and so we sit on the porch and so he taught me all this stuff about bugs and I realize later I started getting into bugs just confuse kind of like an older brother and so I always ask for like insect guides and stuff so I have my my sister's to thank for introducing me to some of the stuff that we were always like running around and you know my friends and have Sun so why we got to play with power tools and we got satellite Barbies on fire in the backyard and you know go get lost and so I was just really loved at the outdoors and getting dirty and stuff so and I studied film and biology in college and I didn't know I was like do I want to be like in arts or do I want to be in sciences and I was like I don't know and so luckily I've gotten to kind of do both but I was always so curious I was like bomb that when you're an adulteress you stop learning about lizards an owl pellets and bugs and how does the brain work there's all their science around everywhere and I was always wanted to ask questions. I love that you explored and for your hundred episode of ologies the five big takeaways that you would learned in a hundred episodes that are at like really great pieces of Life advice if you don't mind we'd love to kind of go to I'm so flattered you listen so can you tell her things are about the fact that like pads are not linear exactly yet that's the thing is you know for my Hundred episode I was like I got to do something for it but I didn't want it to be like too self-congratulatory but I also didn't want to do random talk to me like pants with 100 by like hagfish I mean is that I just texted me and he was like I have some pictures and exclusive packed packed fish pictures you can't share cuz it's not published yet but we found a new hack fish and I was like I was hurt that you haven't listened to a leewards hagfish off with cheese episode do some favor turn it on mucus being believed I was just couldn't handle how much mucus there was but yeah so I from 100 I was like so I started writing up like a fax from every episode and I wrote it all if I spent all day on and I started recording it halfway through his like to offer Ansari does scrap the whole thing and rewrote like the five takeaways and Sofia the first one was just at Pats aren't linear at all like I thought I wanted to be in biology and then I thought I wanted to film and then I went home for a while and was a journalist and covering arts and I missed science so much I started volunteering at this Museum and that got me back into science and got and then I kind of urged all of those freeway as I can to win Super Pad but you know I interview people all the time and it's like I thought I wanted to be a vet I thought I was only good at accounting and so you just hits you don't realize how important those things are along the way to helping you for what you really want to do that's what's so great as you found a way to merge your to love is and make it your job yeah but I thought I was just screwing up along the way all the time because you keep bumping around in your leg but you don't realize that you're picking up a lot of experience on the wagon out the lesson being trust your nonlinear Pat yeah yeah I don't think that just because you didn't start at 8 and an end to be the way you fought that you're screwing up because you just you need to go through a lot of twists and turns and any successful person will tell you that they you know thought they were going. Carson just know you could you don't know until you get there if you're going to like something you're good at it and what a thing to take away from it two people who are experts at field it down until I have that be like on a meme on Instagram like actually sit down with an expert who was studied one thing and is an expert at it to be like oh no like I owe you know this was not a Straight Arrow either yeah it like that you know one of my favorite episodes with Raquel Nuno since she she studies the moon so much is a Scientologist and she talks about how she went into the military for a few years cuz her dad was really sick and needed Healthcare and she's just like we didn't have money so I went to Military and I got my citizenship and hurt but you know you you would never know from looking at her you know that a cure cysts there's a woman who studies Mars and the moon she loves the moon and she has its whole other life you know and so I think it's really interesting with that really formed the way that she studies in and how she goes after her PhD and stuff on raising two kids and she's just it's amazing so my whole goal was like I felt like there were so many podcast I swear I'd just interview bananas comedians that now is like these are great stories but also like the person next to me at Trader Joe's like what do they do with their life you don't like I don't know they might study kidneys and they may be saved his life yesterday there's like Brian turkey burgers and I think the most engaging episodes are at the people were just berserk for what they study like interview this guy J Casey Clapp he lives in Portland and he's an arborist you like a tree expert and I found him I was like I can't wait for you guys to be so great tree tattoos and Pinecone tattoo wrist rest for a minute okay like he looked so vegan and he like a showed up on a fixed gear and I was like dude you are like perfect and he loves trees so much we talked for like an hour 45 minutes I like my longest episode and he's just so flattered that someone cares about trees he's like I don't know if I'm a dendrologist do I know enough about trees and forestry school like your body is covered in tree tattoos like yes you qualify and so you know what hearing about what people love and I think a lot of times we think that everyone wants to do exactly what we want to do so we think that's kind of impossible like everyone must want to be an audio engineer everyone must want to be a kidney expert everyone must want to go to forestiere for streaks we love it so much so we like we think we shouldn't even get in that competition pool but we don't realize it like not everyone loves it as much as you don't worry about it like when you left something that much your whole world is that so your world is smaller than you know exactly and if you really love something you love can I get through the bumps and scrapes and the setbacks because you loved it so you're going to be better at something if you love it so you might as well do the thing you love you know which leads us right into do the thing the thing explain this one to me are you guys procrastinators well I mean I thought I was a procrastinator until I heard you say that you sat on your podcast for 9 months and didn't release it to that I could have had a human freaking baby I could have popped out triplets and be like here's three human beings and instead of just I got some audio files of tinkering with so annoying but yeah I'm kind of a procrastinator cuz I'm a little bit of a perfectionist if you guys are like I'm your house is like gorgeous and perfect and spotless and like perhaps also you are the families out of town lyrics Always Be yes I will straighten pillows before you get there but I definitely have using super high standards for myself and I don't have other people but I kind of do a perfect and if I put something out and it's not perfect then I'm going to be so embarrassed I just might as well not do it so I do the things you do the thing just do it like it's not perfect cuz really nothing it's nothing is ever be perfect and you're not going to be good at anything until you do it and it is just showing up like how much can we get done just by just showing up to try it out in the first gas out of deciding that like it's not going to work out and it's like my sister was talking about a text read that she ate all my cousins are on a Facebook test text her and we miss a lot of messages and have a bunch cousin and my sister is saying that she sometimes doesn't know what to do cuz it's like jumping into a double Dutch jump rope thing couldn't she doesn't want to she said that the other day and I was thinking about this and I told her I'd text her and like I'm kind of tripping that off if you don't mind but you know I think that sometimes there's nothing we want to do and we don't want to start cuz what if it's like getting in like a double dutch thing and what if I screw up and what if I get like Tangled Up and what if I can't do it and everyone laughs at me if it's like you can sit back and watch someone doing double Dutch jump rope for years and that doesn't make you goodnight you're not even good at it you have to go in and you have to have the thing slap you in the face if the screw up me like web start again you're only going to get good at something by doing it and so for me I I learned from all of these ologist in for making this podcast is just like do it screw it up a little bit get better I like temp rocketed like exploding experiments like fail and then you just go back to the drawing board and you start again and that is an interesting thing that I wouldn't have thought about from sitting down with so many experts that I've liked spent years and years and years in a laboratory having to go down a really long road and have it be a dead end and having to be like well I guess I'm going to start from the beginning of the map if it's any evidence always thinking what if I fail what if I fail on the truth is like what if you don't laugh you freaking take off and fly and kill it. You know because if you've tried enough at some point you will ya and I talked to her like you know I'm lucky cuz I get to talk to his ex or allergies but I also am on these at a couple different times just for kids so I get to sit down in like it you know interview the guy that invented the cell phone and like you know a woman who was working on algae biofuel to ask him about their experiments lot and in all of them at the end of the interview already looks the same like you any advice for future innovators and I hear over and over again it like you're going to fail and success is part of their failure is part of success you just are if you don't fail you don't get anywhere so you're going to screw up so just screw up sooner I scrap a lot and then your boom you're a sick FB him interviewing people yeah I have to ask you because bucket list item absolutely must be being with Bill Nye the Science Guy right because he would like to assure them for you. It wasn't even on the list cuz I don't know what I literally was like do you have the right to ask are you been doing right by you guys lyrics I work with mid Rule and sister and I and they reached out some of that producers are like hey you know Bill starting a podcast and we listen to all of you here and we're we're having him listen to ologies to like you know get some tips on science podcast his inspiration for part of development like I guess they're like hey you're so I guess here's how to loot you know just be loose and Goofy on a podcast in like I was like your kid you know that bowtie man yeah I mean come on and she's amazing and I just pretty much was googly-eyed and yeah I mean he's perfect for podcasting to cuz he's just know he's behind us everyone but it was really an honor to be the first gas I would never have imagined that when I was first meeting allergies and being like my husband took you in when Steve and release it and now look where it leads you know I know it leads to my favorite piece of advice number 5 embrace your mutation yes I love that I know we're all just as we're all just a pile of like DNA experiments that went right you know like you just think I was out to dinner with us and evolutionary biologists last night we were talking about that we're talking about symmetry in land animals versus like radial symmetry and in starfish and stuff Real Housewives of my friends see if he's awesome he was eating and he has a podcast called the biology of superheroes so if you're into science and like superheroes are amazing and so we were talking about like a certain science fiction monsters and which ones have radial symmetry like a starfish and which ones have bilateral this is like why I just sat there and listened and so you know that but yeah we're all just a bunch of mutations that went right and if you think of like a butterfly that looks like a leaf when it closes its wings or if you think about a praying mantis that can blend in with an orchid like that wasn't supposed to happen it was a mistake it works it adaptation Works in their favor and then you know kept going on and on until it and so I always think like the most valuable thing you have is what's different about you you know cuz you just do what you have to adapt and you have bracelets with different cuz I had surgery and bison how do you choose your topics cuz that's what you know whenever someone I love that question like what's your hobbies and what do you like to do you know when your free time in like you actually have like a real answer more than just like yoga how do you come up with all of these topics like Have You Been Just fascinated by all these things for a really long time like you're basically your sense of curiosity of what I'm asking about you know I guess I'm just pretty Shameless about it like I had this teacher in high school who is a speech teacher who was just the worst person but she was a great teacher ever was terrified of her she was just like one of Macbeth's which is where you just got to come from the blood would run I see cuz she would yell at people but she was a really good teacher and she she kind of tied kind of taught us like ask questions you know and especially you know as a woman I think a lot of and we're free to raid our hand and asked question because the cards are stacked against you is what you think a lot but you know I think being a journalist before when I'm doing now it's like I had asked questions I got to get my story in and so I just kind of learned well don't learn anything unless you ask and a lot of times a lot of people in like a classroom setting or so glad you asked the question thousand percent always so it's always like the model of the podcast ask smart people stupid questions cuz those those questions are often times or on everyone else's mind or things that maybe they hadn't thought of answering so yeah I'm super super curious cuz I I guess I science always intrigued me from a really emotional standpoint and I think a lot of people don't think of Science in Emotion in this is what we know and I think it's fact-based and it's like pay this is how the world but what they don't realize it's science what we know is just the result of a lot of curiosity we wouldn't know it unless I would learn how to sew and sew along the way experiments that have to fail to have to get proven and so there's so much we don't know still so for me it's really interesting to look around and be like okay like this wooden bookshelf like that's all made out of wood what is wood why are trees just like that how did they get the water up there like why do you why are there rings in a tree you know you see a frog on the patio and you're like what why is it what is it doing on the glass what is it thinking you so for me I always look around and I see science and everything from like the food we eat to like ice cream to I always say that like their science in whiskey and their science in your dog and there's their science and everything you know like this couch is science because it's fiber in a small to grow this way like their science and everything so once you can kind of start to appreciate science you can start to appreciate the context of things do you know so I just I feel like science is kind of emotional yeah because it is contextual so the more you learn about a topic the more you're really invested in an emotionally so now you're like hagfish who cares we going to call spacing it's only a paper. Sad part is what do you feel like what I think is that we live in at this digital age and honestly I just Google it and then there isn't that emotional attachment like even just listen to episode about the the Constitution do you remember the ology ology blood and even know that things like the whole study of the Constitution called animology the study of why I thought I just had such a different appreciation for it hearing about it and and hearing someone else talk about it and you're right in the passion in their voice and the time that you know that they spent studying it and it just makes me sad sometimes a time like I feel like I've lost that sense of real city of like yeah why are there you know instead of being like others a be here instead of somewhere you know different seasonal shifts instead of experiencing them in and pink area so it seems so childlike in a good way because we lose that the older we get we lose our sense of wonder and it feels like you have never lost that in fact you've developed at even though I think I probably have I mean you know one thing I always think I was like okay I watched I watch The Bachelor I haven't watched a couple years most of his apologies cuz I'm like you know going into deep. But I watch The Bachelorette you if someone just like a you want to come watch the finale and you have not watch the season I don't care who what why are they crying you don't care but if you watch from the limo episode that last episode you're like oh my god did he look at her that way. can I text you his backstory to what I try to do with ologies is like you like what does me doing here I don't know but as soon as you know like us are they swarming is that a queen bee what's the deal are they I like you have all this context so I try to give people like scientific contacts so that everything feels like the finale of a reality show the first article that came up at 5 O my gosh I love I do love podcast I love liked videos on YouTube there's some awesome YouTube channels like a brain scoop with Emily graslie is awesome Hank Green is awesome so I'll let go and watch like he YouTube channels that are like kid friendly but I kind of always feel like there wasn't science for adults and so I keep all the swearing we talked about lizard dongs like I talk about buttholes constantly because it's like I felt like a lot of Sciences cleaned up for kids and then I felt like where's the signs for adults cuz then or just being like science is for children like you know chicken McNuggets and whatever like a juice boxes but it's like kind of his like making an alcoholic Juice Box thing like I don't think it it too but yeah I like my I came across this list of ologies like 15 years ago and wanted to do something with it and so I was like I don't know and so I just started looking this list out who does this look at one of my car at a hundred episode 300 ologies is there an LG you have haven't done yet that you're dying to do I have so many I'm so many I'm dying to do chiropterology is a bats and I'm like a my plan is for October to do like spooktober where it's like a spider episode of the had a persimmon a demonology episode like just Airi like just a little darkness chiropterology is the study of bats and the name of it is Cairo me of hands like a chiropractor means they fix you with her hands and puts her hair is needs Wing so I got a pterodactyl so chiropterology is handling and that's where the name for bats comes from a guy named Austin Texas and studies and so I'm like I'm coming for you.

wherever you're listening right now where's the craziest plays the itis Journeys brought you like we're if you'd like ended up in like a cave with the crazy Beetle or like a whole rest or I don't know okay that'll happen in Austin with Mariah and I mean I'm like I don't know how I'm going to contain myself for that but I'm excited for those photos it's always the places that you don't expect me recording like I had this guy who was an avalanche expert who is on like ski patrol he's amazing and you know he studies snow he studied Avalanches so he has to shoot at Avalanche has to have them fall preemptively before they fall in skiers like the you know he told me the story where he he watched some of his co-workers fall into like a boss and died and he took over their work and that's how he got his PhD this really emotional story we recorded all of it on a bench outside of LAX because he was on a layover and I couldn't we couldn't do it in person and so he's like I have a 2 hour layover I drove to Allie X I like met him outside of the terminal with planes going by Anna Marie Hughes told me this like wrenching story so it's takes me to some weird Tyson how would someone that you would have never cross paths with yeah and I have that like on an airport bench that exchange of like knowledge and and then like emotional like story of it's cool that I it's it's really gratifying to me to take scientist who we might just here in like an NPR soundbite up like will the rivers are unusually high and she's okay but it's more interesting to hear like well you know I grew up on a river and I almost drowned and I wanted to know how river currents worked and go that's me we never hear that it's Human Side of scientists so we think of Sciences really sterile we don't hear how sloppy and messy and scurrying and riveting an emotional it is you know you never think about scientist crying over their work but like guaranteed every scientist is like a breakdown over a data shaping like I screw this up you know so I wanted to eat human eye scientist to make science less intimidating you know as a parent of a three year old like they'll be watching the Wild Kratts which is on PBS show on PBS we love you and it's like these guys who turned themselves into animals suits and then you learn about the animals within the ecosystem and then she wants the Wild Kratts juice at the grocery store but I've never heard of in the depths of the ocean and you're right there isn't like there isn't a form of that for adults really unless you seek it out tons of murder documentary of them and you know I think that's that's what I have a hard time with his what were fed is I feel like it's a little exploited it is maybe doesn't represent all of the Magic in the world to know where we're fed the very very my new show of like what salad is this one very rich person eating today and did you know that she got haircut and dinner today to see the sandals this woman who you've never met will never meet is wearing and we're like this is relevant information and I will click on it and like many purses there and I saw Courtney hadwin and so it's so sad you're right I don't know why I know which shoes the Kardashians are running and I don't know why there are rings and circles in a tree and I think they I think especially known especially those women were marketed like very specific information that will not impact our lives at all and so I think what I wanted to do is say like what did you want to talk about crazy wizard decks are you want to figure out if a snake farts like you want to talk about like guess we do know who do like you know it's exology do you want to talk about you know why were scared of some things in victimology was a really incredible que no thank you I I really struggle that because you know my my sister the one who was at into heavy metal she's an amazing writer and she's on she was a crime reporter so you know I did my dad was a was a journalist as well so I grew up hearing about a lot of you know a lot of those scary things and I feel like the things that get are dopamine firing as I kind of scared so I'm paying attention you know or this picture of this makes me feel slightly bad about myself and so I'm going to look at it you don't like this is just the shock shock test yeah and I think that there's so much other information out there that is just kind of like swept away and put in a closet and it's for kids only or is we think it's 4 and where is for certain type of academic and it's not it's it's much more relatable weirder like can you imagine if they're like PS Justin Bieber has two decks and Kourtney Kardashian can clone herself and you're like that would be insane news lizards can do that shit why can't we talk about it but you know if if celebrities to do some of the stuff that is there a celebrity they could throw out gallons of mucus whenever the paparazzi were around think that would be amazing if they can do it so it's like you know there's there's so much out there so I think sometimes it helps you know get us out of our just like human HR human brain so I care about all this stuff in nature this or new celebrity should be Earth creatures I love it I love it I want to read that us with nematodes just like us we would be like neck-deep and shit like honestly like this world would be a disaster without like you know fungus and flies and stuff so you're like let's hear about him but it really was I will say that if anyone is ever going to run what's my deal honestly volunteering is like the best thing that ever happened to me and you always think I don't think I have a time and then if you look on your iPhone settings of how much time you spend on like Twitter and Instagram everyone's got a little time but yeah I was just in a super rush I was so depressed and just was like why am I like I can't do it it's taxes to National History History Museum down at the Natural History Museum in La I just signed up for 3 hours a week I went down there like early morning wearing a vest and like a wall our creator and the best were never washed they have been very specific Funk that I'm like never clean these grad students and avril's call Mike Waters everyone else doing here you know and and you're with these people you never get to meet and you get to let you know tell kids about stuff and you get to learn it on on the job there's no steaks you can't get paid you can't get fired and I'm sure you could but you know it really I just did it sound like I'm really missing science and I really just need to do something that is like not at John paste and it really reconnected me with what I love so I think if anyone's ever like in a rut or super depressed or needs a life change like figure out what you would love to do like what gives you butterflies and figure out what you're really passionate about and see if there's a way you can volunteer even a couple hours a week or couple hours a month in it whether it's like you want to be a writer and poet like if there's a literacy program and get reconnected to writing in that way you know you're thinking about health care if you could volunteer Hospital animals or something figure out what you love and see if there's a way you can go do it for free and inspiring constantly Explorer yeah yeah for sure it really itchy change my whole life so I'm almost really lucky for this like super low that I had this is like 2013 like my boyfriend who I'm still with at the time he had like a mental breakdown and he had a r e was in a really bad place and you know he was like he's gray now he was like suicidal but I my dad just got diagnosed with cancer like I had another relative died I was a mess dude but I was working in TV and I was like in you know at a spread in Cosmo magazine of me wearing like $1,500 borrowed shoes would like to suck those shoes are a song after that everything on the outside looks really great was like you're doing all this stuff and I was like oh I'm crying all the time you know and that was when I started volunteering I was just like everything around me personally was so hard that I just wanted to go somewhere that would make me happy and it ended up you know being the change my career to to where I was doing something I'm super passionate about and you know my dad's it was really you know when sometimes you need like with a Pat's not when they are sometimes you need to like really falling across to be like okay I got to scrape myself out of this one and if it's time it seems like the worst thing but it can really really Propel you in a direction just cuz you have to survive if you know and I love that it got you back in touch with something that truly just made you happy. Like something simple that just made you happy yeah the joy of science totally and I just would like it if I do if I do this and it's going to take me to this step and it's going to take me to the stuff and then and then and then I'm going to have everything figured out instead it was just like we would like why are you doing that in the social media world's it can I find myself being so task-oriented or just even listening to you it's like yeah why am I pursuing things that is it for other people or is it for me a certain why why not make a list of things that really bring me joy to see in the Explorer that and go and just be curious yeah yeah it really it honestly is something where we just got out of touch a lot with what we love and and even just even if you end up not changing your career entirely just doing something you really like I think can be really infectious and also just exposing yourself to people that you wouldn't necessarily meet you know I think a lot of times worthless now I got to go to this network is playing the great to be like 70 year olds and five year old to know the same day like that's what I loved about the museum I was like to talk to people about like their koi ponds and like what happened in the Korean War they're weird injuries in a 5 year olds like are you working in these days I have to just talk to him or there aren't steaks and just so you know where people stories and so yeah that. Was I think if you're ever in like I just figure out what would you want to do for free that sounds fun for a couple hours a week and see if he could do it you know it's it's definitely worth it and you know if you like acting ghetto to go to a workshop or write a one person playing Put it on in a backyard you know it's it might not get you all the glory but this thing that it will do is like refocus what you love about something cuz it's so hard to keep going when you when you do fail a little bit along the way and you're like you know I have friends and you know my boyfriend Wilson control this was like I don't know he'll get rejected by things and he's in that entertainment business is brilliant amazing but you know how get rejected by it and it's one of those things are like just room what you love about something cuz you know it's there are there are bumps on the way I think you really hit it correctly when you said like don't I think we're all focusing on doing stuff for the glory that are focusing on doing it for ourselves and sometimes when you do for yourself you end up finding a path that gives you glory yeah yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't have made ologies and I wouldn't be working in science to be if I didn't just go volunteer there in the one thing I liked about volunteering is it it was not useful at my life my life and she was and she just like come take a tour of the museum I was like yeah that's what's right and she's like you should volunteer here and I think I like who are you talkin to me but yeah I like it just reconnecting with what you love about something and I think that's the thing I love about interviewing ologist is like they tell you know whether it's about like trees or Wales or whatever they are Intuit and they've made sacrifices to do it and it's not always the most well paying job maybe nobody you know nobody in their family cares that they care about skunks as much when what dates really infectious some people have a lot of passion you know so it's just like what do you what makes you like slightly nauseated like what maybe makes you have diarrhea with excitement is really what is that I don't know what is it is Aviation I don't know so yeah just find out like what makes you slightly slightly sick and that do that do I know we talked about how social media can take us away from what we loved but I also want to talk about this tweet that you retweeted and the power that one to eat can have like because it for our listeners who don't yet follow alley on Twitter there was the sweet but Macy's had a pop-up store called story and they sell plates smaller and smaller circles and the the first one is labeled mom jeans the second one was labeled favorite jeans the smallest one is labeled skinny jeans you saw this and you treated as a photo of this with a caption say how can I get these banned from at Macy's and then they responded back to you yes to talk to us about that that's so cool not not just how can I get this band but how can I get this band in all 50 states. I just didn't want Hawaii or Alaska to get these plants as well as I was like I was in New York for a couple days like in between shoots I had to like I was just kind of a room there between Toronto and New Jersey to my hotel room just went out to get some food but I happen to walk by that and I walked by and then I turn around and take a picture. Very annoying and I could just roll my eyes at it but that doesn't do anything so just take a picture and it's just like gross you know in my calves was just essentially like how can I get this band was a joke cuz I don't expect legislation to go down like I just did and I was over the Constitution like we're not going to get these things bad but it was just like barf right and it got retweeted a bunch and so many seasons like hey thanks and I didn't think much of it but it got picked up by like box and Breitbart in a bunch of outlets the politicized it alot we're essentially like standing up for a half of humanity it was a political act where is like there was nothing I guess people telling me I didn't I didn't understand a joke when I was like you took bandwidth so yeah I got some I got some weird weird people in my mentions but it was a storm that blew over but I did this episode with dr. Renee and gallon who is a researcher in an author she has a book called Beauty sick and she writes about how beauty standards are very lucrative for a lot of companies and there were super harmful or you know particularly women eat people identify as women I was in the trans community and lgbtq community that was kind of gender expectations were our parents are super harmful and and she's awesome I didn't a 2-part episode called kalologie which is the study of Beauty with her and she's like there's a word for that I would like to go figure I just got out and so I did the interview with her and then I asked for listeners to just send me emails of their interaction with beauty standards and I got really really like just a flood of emails from people that you know from all all different kind of experiences and backgrounds and how beauty standards make them feel and entire just read their letters for the second episode just to get anyone who is like I just like like don't wear lipstick if you don't want to wear them to look like there's so much more to it it's so much more to it and realize that's being constantly marketed to us on a level that's constant constant and and so I read all these letters that way I could get a good sampling of people who like yeah you know I like working with makeup cuz it's an art form I like to do you know or my I have a nonbinary teen who cries you know if they don't have enough makeup on for school cuz they don't you know how they identify they feel like they really strong urge to make himself at anyway so it's just it just I already was on like a very Flex Ennis soapbox about this but but having done that interview I do know I saw those stupid plates and I was just like it's going to continue unless we stand up for and I could make those tweets 10 times a day like that that's a whole company by the way oh yeah I won't say that but it's it's an entire company of plates that say essentially like one size in a positive way and if the others more food on the plate than that circle is immediately like a negative comment and it's also like that's not even scientifically sound like greens and some lean protein great that might be good for your metabolism or whatever but it's like a small serving of like high like high calorie dense food isn't any better for you to lick your lips discouraging people from eating like a healthy volume of vegetables are from eating at all which is better yeah I got an email from a guy who just said hey thanks for that my daughter was my daughter's struggled with an eating disorder for 9 years and we lost our she's you know she passed away from it and so thanks for calling it out and keys you don't like I from Texas probably wouldn't care about that at all if he didn't have experience with that sell celery I would say I had a meeting in one of those buildings oh my God next time you go oh I had to like I I wish I'd taken a picture because I had to like I hyperventilate into a bag I was so annoyed and this is before play gate so I know I would just do it there's a beauty salon in there and it's like I can do and treat yourself to a Brazilian and I'm like treat yourself to getting a Brazilian wax your butthole waxed like that is not an Indulgence Willits maybe it's for one person or so whoever's on the receiving end, but like whoever made this it's like have you ever undergone that I can't have you ever had your grundle wax but it's just like the idea that we're Market it's like treat yourself by giving a $75 to undergo something unnatural and painful is just like I should do something nice for my son just keep walking like a Kardashian to like Kylie being a billionaire or lipstick is something that we like good for her and yes good for her but it's also like those are the industries where women can 6 Best Buy selling things to other women that these women need to feel confident and it's like why can't we feel confident without lipstick or why do we need you know why is it external we are the only people that can see our lips in a room I can't see I can't so it's just look great by the way I was just going to say that I love your lip color I think you something that goes on in the morning and then I have to drop it off at night if it's like very limited yeah it is not like that episode was like I do this to where do I put my eyelashes in a vice every morning that's weird but it's just one of those things to do to keep an eye out and realize when are we making other people money by feeling like we need something you know when is something actually I saw something that was like so cared shouldn't cost money and we're marketed a lot of stuff and so like a you-know-what Brazilian wax in so many different ways on your right is Stephen walking through the mall everything we're looking at it's like you're not enough you need this you can miss you need that we are just looking outside and seen the wonder that is around us and asking questions about what makes that beautiful and what makes that special and how that works cuz you just hearing you talk about all of these ologies is so fulfilling an inspiring and in igniting and I definitely want to I think that's where you can get a good fill yes yeah ask people their story is you know like I think a lot of times we're like well I don't respond unless it's person has something to offer me then maybe I don't know if you know what's the context of my life. Like if you start asking people about like what they're into or get over there with a spouse how do you know when she's saying and it's I think there's a lot of contacts that we can take away from our own lives in and just figuring out like what really makes you happy forces what are you thinking is going to make you acceptable to other people you know and also if you don't see yourself in a room full of people that to me what I've learned so much as that means you belong there even more you know they like need your voice and I think and science at something that you know I talked to a lot of people here like if you know I didn't think that I didn't see myself as a scientist cuz you know whether it was a class of all Kaiser is no one who look like me or I was. You know the only transpersonal my programmer the only lgbtq remember my Academy you know and that just means that like you belong there even more like the. Field needs you even more and so I think you know that's that's been something where it's it's really important me to be like okay yeah like show up show up like you belong and then have fun of yourself of that you know so well are we officially Ali word ologist thank you for asking restaurant so much for joining us and and just sharing with us your time and all of your knowledge and inspiring us where can I listen to find you well I'm at Alie Ward with one else o a l i e w a r d on Instagram and Twitter and then if you want to find out more about ologies are the ologist and you do trust that you will have a crush on like we like I have a crush on a coral expert I've never going to be this amazing I'm just I'm just like the weird dad Uncle that's like a check out this fact I know it's not grasshopper when I was mowing the lawn I feel like everyone's like like we're done I feel like I like my sister's ex-boyfriend the porch like chicken but yeah it in all of these is a tautology is on Twitter and Instagram and you can find a podcast on you know whatever podcast on Stitcher in iTunes and Spotify and all that stuff and then just a scroll and find a topic you think it's interesting and then listen to it.
