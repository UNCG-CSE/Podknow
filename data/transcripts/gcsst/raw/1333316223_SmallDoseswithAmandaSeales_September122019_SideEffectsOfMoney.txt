at small doses book.com so funky okay Rebecca said we have to record this episode and so we are starting now and perhaps my procrastination recording this episode is because you know it's it's kind of a wonky kind of 1 now when we talked about side effects of money I think we need to be specific this is a side effects of having money with that side effects of being broke side effects of having money as a different Dynamic and I think it's worth the conversation because for all intensive purposes I think we specially for my listeners who live in like primarily capitalist societies like America having money is a goal that is provided to everybody very early on in their lives like this is something that you should Aspire with you and you make a choice on how much you want to align your life and your philosophies and your actions with that and I can definitely be a part of what changes like your karma your destiny you're you're even just your everyday Outlook your contentment your happiness but at the end of the day as my college professor Thomasina Hutchins said it SUNY Purchase money is a delightful enabler and when you look at it that way you got to understand that it's worth a conversation because if by chance you do find a way to attain money and I possess money it specifically if you live in America what does that mean for how things change in your life we're going to talk about that today right here on small does it let's do it bad thing what I see when I can eat is a man it happens happens if they have the podcast should I just deal with it okay 10 Batman damned is net worth versus value so I know people listen to ardenne dropping the same thing let me tell you why they different your net worth is how much money you actually possess now it could be liquid it could be an asset but the end of the day it's how much money you possess here on this show and this damn droppery when we talked about value we're talking about value Beyond just a monetary measure cuz value can have other ways of being measured and this becomes very distinctive especially when you're working a professional spaces right and understanding that your value doesn't necessarily have to simply be about how much money you bring to the table it could be about how much influence you bring to the table it can be about how much clout but also like when you validate something so like for instance you can bring value to something by maybe you're not rich in terms of money maybe you don't have net worth but you have a skill set that people trust and so when who are attached that project you are bringing value to it because now people who trust you trust this project right when I do ads on the show there's a value that I'm adding to them because if I'm going to promote your ad it's because my audience trust and I'm not promoting shit that I'm not behind and that's something that I have built up over time and consistency in a way that is not even about money it's simply about time and some people say but Amanda is money right so network is Soho there is value net worth is just simply like what is your money worth and people love to go online and do shit like so and so's net worth and this person's net worth and I don't even know how they come up with these numbers I definitely looked at my net worth and was like the word if that's what you think but it's important to know net worth in certain situations for a number of reasons if it's a professional reason like maybe you're trying to work with somebody in a investor scenario if their net worth doesn't match like what they're claiming they want to invest you may have to like say yes or no to that that that maybe a barometer upon what you're basing your decision now in a friendship when you talk about someone's net worth would that really ends up feeling like it's somebody counting your pockets and that's when you can be in a bad side of things because I think they said sometimes what happens in Friendship is you looking at someone's net worth as a reason for either maybe like why you have problems in your friendship or why they should be doing this or that for you or this or that for somebody else and it starts becoming a source of judgment and I just personally feel like there's no place and looking at anybody's net worth in a friendship unless it's we're all going out to dinner and someone so it's coming and so we need to be respectful of the fact that her net worth can't handle us going to Nobu and so it just becomes a matter of just being conscious of who is in your friend Circle to let your not necessarily putting them in a precarious situation like I remember one time I found myself in a birthday dinner for fucking to recipes for Q-tip and I have no goddamn money at the time like I was a broke like artists like trying to just figure it out and I'm sitting at the table with like him and Jay-Z and Beyonce and the Dreamhouse Dannon and who else was there Angie Martinez and at the end of the dinner like a Bill gets passed around that everybody's owes $250 now when I tell you all like that dope you're at the top of the show like that's what most people must have heard because I'd legit was like so much of the person sitting next to me was like I got you yeah that person to have a shirt ex-wife Grace but she's I never met her before but she just I guess knew in that moment or maybe she just knew for my Forever 21 attire that like I didn't have it I didn't have it and she looked out for me and I appreciate her doing that because she size up my net worth and saw the value in looking out but I think a lot of times it ends up being a negative when we look at our friends net worth and maybe I could be wrong about that how you guys are in a few interacting with your friendships but I just feel like it hasn't worked out in the positive way with my friendships and sometimes it's a matter of people over looking or under looking and when it comes to Value to me that's really more so where I'm placing my energy on like people's value is far beyond anything monetary you know people live in value to you in terms of their companionship may be at their intellect maybe it's the love that they bring to his face and I've definitely seen the people of manipulate your value against your net worth like I've had a boyfriend who knew that I valued him even though he had known that worth you knew that I valued him for other reasons and so he basically he exploited that like he basically like leaned on my net worth because he knew that I valued him in these other ways and didn't and and and and the reason I say that is because for a long time like that exchange was a fair exchange to me because it was like he brought things that to me were more valuable than money so it was fine but if end and I brought that my share of those things but I also provided like a certain fiduciary foundation for us but then it a certain point the equality loses itself when the other person stops bringing those things that you value to the table but still wants to take from you in these other ways that affect your net worth and so that's why I like I've I saw it meme the other day with someone said stop forcing women to to date for men and people were so upset about like what is that supposed to mean you know why can't women be supportive and you know glow up with their man excetera excetera and it's like that with that sang what it's saying is it doesn't make me a bad person to not want to support you financially while I'm engaging in the other valuable things about you because at the end of the day they exist in two different planes there's net worth and there's value and we can both value each other in ways that are not monetary at the same time that we can acknowledge that there's a monetary base it's still as humans and adults need to be met and a lot of times with a lot of relationships when one person is insecure and what their net worth is versus the other it can affect the valued thing is that they are bringing to the table it says it's like not handed those intangibles you know and that's really what that ends up being and it's just idea that says that like women have to be willing to support men who don't have money because they are just as good man and it's like that's not the conversation it's a false equivalency to the reality anyways I digress money value is about more than money and you have to determine how those things measure up and really what those things serve in your life and where they serve their purpose in business and friendship and romance in the clear you are to me the clear you are on how all those things play the less those things will affect your business your friendships

Oh don't don't say nothing how does money affect relationships and expectations like who pays for what does family now think you should help them consistently are there certain life changes are good feelings you thought having a comfortable amount of money would bring but that just did not happen let me lay back on this day bed let's just have one question at a time how does money affect relationships and expectations like who pays for what does family not think you should help them consistently that I'm very fortunate that I have a very small family because for what it's worth like when I was broke my family really don't have nothing to do with me and my mama so now that I'm Poppin I think there's a certain respectful distance that people have in terms of that going that far don't get me wrong like there is there is now a larger claim being made to just like the the I'm a part of the Amanda seales plan of it all but I have been fortunate that I don't have people like coming at me looking for me to like find them for things and I'm super Keen about things like that anyway like what I've actually more than just money for the family I've had people just like on Instagram and stuff like feel like I owe this is a famous person let me ask them for things and so they'll like send me your requests like ass I need to pay for their tuition or owe me and my friend are about to get evicted and you know I need $280 by tonight or you know my mom or my son we're going to be in a shelter you know they play at your put the tug at your heartstrings I'd even gotten literal like PayPal request for groceries from strangers who use like an email address if they found online and next thing you know I'm like what is this and I got that looking venmo as well so it's really just this Twisted thought process it says like if people have money that they need to give it to me by the opposite I do feel like if I have money I need to be giving it out but it should be at my discretion and I think that there is a stop process that says that like if people have money I owe you and that's just with anything it's like if it's yours and you put in the time to get it like you did your discretion on how you disseminate it and that should be respected in my opinion but there's interconnectivity of people at this point that you don't have to always do not always dealing with people that share the same opinion so that's how you end up with a goddamn venmo request for sneakers are there certain life changes are good feelings you thought having a comfortable amount of money would bring but that just did not happen I felt like there was going to be a certain level of like he's and there is like don't get me wrong like I I think that there was a certain that high level of emotional turmoil and mental strain that I was having simply just by worrying about how am I going to pay for things and there was definitely all of that attach to like my creativity right so like I'm having to use creativity in terms of like get creative on how to make money for Chris's being creative on a canvas and I remember like when I met Herbie Hancock for the first time he had said to me like everybody's an artist and I said what do you mean he said because it requires a certain level of creativity to just survive and I was like and he said this while wearing like a very like Oriental style suit and yes to anybody was about to come in my DM Oriental is the proper term for when you are describing a product Asian is what you use to describe a person but I digress so he was wearing like he look like eating mine like he was about to train me in the art of like what is it is a particular style of kung fu and there's somebody was listening right now that is in the middle of dming me because their leg is it because he was who trained Bruce Lee so anywho when someone speaks to you and says like really like strong like deep words and they're dressed in Oriental attire it always comes out deeper I mean there's a rule because you feel like they're using Eastern wisdom to look through your soul these are the facts go watch Golden Child tell me I'm wrong so then I thought about that is true it's like now that I don't have to be as creative with how to survive and it allowed me to be more creative in my art now there's still a whole new level of things are you into dealing with the use kind of didn't necessarily truly know and that's why the Notorious BIG AKA Christopher Wallace said Mo Money Mo Problems because you really thought you knew problems and then not in money introduces you to a whole bunch of new problems that never had occurred to you that never seems like a concept you know just like taxes and and the idea of like budgeting and the idea of like having to check your own materialism and having to be aware of how you don't let money like triple its way into your relationship in the same way and you know the the paranoia that I can bring about you know about like the reality that you can be in about about people trying to steal from you and then the actuality of people stealing from you all of those things are like oh wait I hadn't even truly put a lot of thought into that because they weren't my problems like and so you know I'm not saying that they're they definitely are champagne problems but at the end of the day they are new issues and they come in place of the old issues and I think that it really ends up being for me just a matter of keeping grounded and humble and what some people will try and tell you is that being grounded and humble is somehow like still pretending like you have no money and I don't agree with that baby brother in Humble is always remembering how you got there and remembering that there are other people trying to get there and remembering that with more money and not only does that come with more problems it comes with more responsibility and you have a responsibility because we live in a world where when you have more money you have more quote on quote power you know you have clinical more access you have a quart of cold more invincibility and in my room and my ethics I believe if you have all of those things then you now also have a responsibility and accountability and an awareness and Consciousness that needs to be heightened and I don't think enough people think that way who have money and that's why the Amazon is burning next question how do you feel about taxes next question how do you communicate that you are growing and protecting your back to friends who are consistently asking for money and not replenishing what they are going to go borrow get to really like put a value on the Friendship at that point right because there's a certain awareness and he seemed a bit like you're not an ETF and that are they friends with you because of what you provide them in value or what you provide for them in that work and is the end of it is because the network part of it shouldn't even be a part of why they're friends with you but I like I don't think that that should have any role in why they're friends with you in terms of now before I even go further with that let me just say this you will see people say like why you only friends with other rich people or why are why are y'all at why is it only celebrities hang out with other celebrities and if you're not in that space it can feel like oh they're being elitist they're being exclusionary you know they're ostracizing but it ends up being that way because you don't want to have to have the feeling of what this question is right here you don't want to have to feel like you're with people who are trying to take from you unfairly or without request without respect so one way of avoiding that is by associating with people who don't need anything from you in the value of net worth and is spares this type of uncomfortability and so a lot of times like that's why you see that because you simply just realized like you know what I don't want to make people feel bad and I don't want to feel bad about this particular thing because of money money does have a dirty Miss to it figuratively and literally that's why in the movie ATL when Wendy eyes character throws the money at big boy is not going to hit him in the mouth he's like oh shit it's not only disrespectful it's unsanitary but there's just this idea that because we're friends what I've got is yours and I think that when it comes to net worth and money that could be a line that needs to not be blurry at all like I have no problem helping people out but there's also got to have a certain level of respectability about like what the boundaries of that are and when you say that like you're giving people bread and they're not replenishing and they're not giving it back that's not okay that's not okay there's also going to be a limit you know I'm saying there's also going to be like a reality to like okay I can't keep supporting you in this way because it's like it's it's making me hard to support myself but you got to come up with that on your own terms cuz we have to do that with emotions as well right like emotionally you can end up supporting somebody so much that you're just like damn like who am I net worth is strong with my value is is it red and that is a doozy itself But to answer your question specifically I think it just ends up being a conversation of like listen these are my limits and this is where I'm at and you also deciding like how much do your emotions play in how you move your money cuz sometimes that's what gets that's right cuz we're emotionally attached to certain people or just certain situations and so our money gets attached to that as well like I'm emotionally attached to animals which is why I end up donating to like this group of women who helped foxes in Ukraine like and they like save like wildlife in the Ukraine a bunch of crazy bread to them but like every so often they need like a couple bucks to help a raven whose wings just got cut off and won't be able to fly again or to build an Aviary for for you know of a fox names star or Fox named Thor or if I've seen fire I mean I'm in love with him sauces guys but like my emotional attachment to animals and to the protection of nature on our planet ends up being somewhere where I put my money and sometimes I can tell time with people right like your emotional attachment to someone may just be like what I felt like I just want to be okay so let me just give it to the let me just give it to him let me just give it to them just got to check yourself and check in with them and make sure that you're not depleting yourself beyond your measures the side effects of having money in your mid-to-late thirties but no kids and not married so therefore my question is how do you deal with people looking in and judging you for living your better life with the tradition stand I love the freedom and don't know if I ever want marriage or kids but people keep telling me how to spend my money judging me based on the fact that I'm not spending it on those two things I mean that's like it is that they're not on your level because they don't have maybe the same network but they're not here level because they're judging you for something that just simply isn't worth judging you for like a be different if you didn't have kids and you didn't anywhere married and the money that you had you were putting into like funding things that are hurting other people you know like I don't care the marriage take it all by myself like I be like yeah that's it. You know I have kids and I married so I give all my money to be a ride occasion of foxes in Russia I will be like cuz they're also just like honey child but there's simply just no place for anybody to tell you like how to spend your money when your money isn't harming people. That's how I felt like and I think that there is a stop process when people are married and had kids is like well we will be better served with money than you we deserve money more than you deserve money because we're actually like doing something in this world that is like going along with tradition and that's a bunch of bull fucking shit to it really is as Brandon is just pointed out the government pays you for kids and send them in some countries substantially more shit in Dubai it's something like you get money for every kid that you have plus you get property to my knowledge you get like a land and if you get married you get you are given land I believe that to be known for a fact so you should be able to spend your money out of the fuck you want to spend your money as long as you're not hurting nobody now though of course of course of course when you're reckless with your money you may have people around you that are just like hey let me just like pull your coat a bit and give you a heads up like you could probably be doing other things with that money that may be more useful to you and maybe more enjoyable to you but then if you're like not but that like I'm good I'm good I'm going to spend my money on these $500 sneakers and this $1,700 Lando Calrissian doll and you're not going to tell me anything about it it's like as long as everyone is asking you for money like what does it matter what does it matter I mean is always end up just being an issue like when you're in a relationship with somebody in their they're bad at spending money you know how are there they're not being so thoughtful about the two of you but if you're an idiot visual fuck anybody was going to tell you like you shouldn't be rich cuz you don't have a husband or kids like I'm probably cuz I don't have a husband or kids last question how do you break habits of when you were poor to now having money this is for all my West Indians out there cuz this is a real cat like you get the bread and then you're afraid that you're going to lose it and so you don't spend it that's like a real thing when I got my Benz. I didn't drive it for 2 weeks I will come downstairs and parking lot and I was just look at it and I'll run back upstairs and I will come back out again and be like I'm still there huh okay. For 2 weeks and then the person I was seeing at the time was like can you just go drive your fucking car is your car you earned it like go try it now the kid suit myself up when I was there I took it out for a spin and I was so relieved when I got back in the house I was so relieved but it was like this feeling like I didn't it wasn't that I didn't deserve it it was just like I don't even know like how I handle this and I had to kind of consciously tell myself like and remind myself like all of this is material like you know how to handle this because at the end of the day it's just another like man-made thing this now in your possession and even if you know as long as you were okay that's all that really truly matters but the Habit change isn't really about like oh I have money now and I was broke before it's really about fear and you have a habit of it I have to be certain fears that are real and that were actual and now you're in a new place where like those fears don't really makes there now irrational like having a fear of being evicted because you can't pay your rent or having a fear of not being able to get health care because you don't have the money that you may need to go to the doctor like having a fear of your child not eating because you don't have money like those are real genuine things that you should that that that you have every right to be afraid of like when you don't have bread like all of these things even my biggest fear my biggest biggest biggest biggest fear was that my mother was going to die before I was financially stable because I knew that me being financially stable would give her a certain level of like stability a certain level of Liberation a certain level of like getting her just do from the universe you know like you gave me the job of raising her and now that she's secure I feel like the universe gave me what I owed I think a lot of like parents feel that way and I think there's a lot of West Indian parents it absolutely feel that way like you know like I mean I don't really know like what is that what do I get to know that you know and I was just deathly afraid of that was going to happen so when I got to pay off my mom's house earlier this year and I got to pay off my college loans like there was a certain level of just like Waiting to Exhale that happened in feeling like okay that fear is now eradicated but when you just Gwen you kind of go over that the hedge of of a certain level of Financial Security like those other fears they still can be there because you haven't really conceptualize the truth of the fact that like oh I I don't have to be afraid of that anymore and that's a dude that's a number that you that help with yourself whew child literally have you ever thinking about or wondering if for knowledge is power cuz when you no more you can make better decisions and when it comes to many women especially in my little age group of the upper 30s are fertility is a very big don't really know yeah it's a? And like I've been in a lot of us I thought about like okay I guess a baby could be like in the common near future or maybe for some of us it's like no a baby needs to happen like immediately but you may not know the jump-off point and maybe kind of like Shook Ones I'm finding out like do I even had any eggs left up in this bed if you want more information about your ability to get pregnant you need modern fertility monitor fertility is a quick and easy hormone test you can take it home with your thinking of trying for a baby now what are your options for the future so I know like you know it's like you're playing Spades you want to know like I do I got to with a possible or do I got the big Joker I want to know your results are delivered within 10 days and your personalized dashboard will give you insight into how many eggs you have hormone levels and any reproductive red flag and you can talk one-on-one with a fertility nurse or use the timeline tool to Pan Am Plaza testing for your doctor can cost over $8,000 when you can get the same information for $159 now listen people ask me like old man don't even have a kid like you think about having kids or do you want to kiss you all asked me that and I always tell people like I mean if it happens it happens if it doesn't it doesn't and then it's honestly like I don't even know if I can like I've never tried Leti Paisley is like giving me the opportunity to find out without having to go to extra levels extra measures if you're a cancer you like I ain't really Charlie might have to go find out something that I don't even know if I want to know my other fertility is doing exactly what you need to do it's making it easy for you to find out about you without having to jump through hoops and right now he is offering our listeners $20 off a test when you go to might have bratayley.com small doses that's major y'all $20 off your fertility test when you go to Modern fertility.

before it like when I was going to H&R Block you know to get my taxes done Etc money ends up being presented to you as something that is like very finite and it is not yours and it ends up being presented to you as something to be scared of for all intensive purposes because it's about taxes and it's about like you want to get out of there then you know you don't want to create issues and so there's a anxiety around it that can really like permeate your day today and how you move and as I got more successful I need an accountant that could do more and so I ended up with this sister who is based in Cleveland and she has really changed how I look at money and how I look at accountants I think for a lot of us like we have always kind of seen accountants of Representatives like one of two things either is like really droll kind of boring people who are only about numbers and like if you watch Parks and Rec it's like the ongoing joke of Leslie nose has been like being a sled be at this accounting firm and then like every time he goes he has to like actually not end up staying there and they're just like a man like they're just boring people or you get presented this idea that accountants are like he's like really likes like a slimy like people trying to like cheat you out of your money Federer Etc it doesn't have to be that way and specifically like as a black woman independent entrepreneur I have had to have a different relationship with my accountant because I have a different relationship with money and I think some people it doesn't matter for them because for them all money is a means to an end or a means to get more money where is for me my money is a means to create more opportunity of creativity for myself and for other so how I spend it how I can serve it how I am taxed on it excetera excetera has to be managed by somebody who can conceptually and acetic leave look at my money that way and not all accounts have the ability to do that they don't answer I feel very fortunate to have actually like come and come in contact with somebody who is able to grasp that from me like money is not simply about buying find things and creating access in terms of like power from me money is a tool to make other people and myself have a better chance at finding contentment and joy in our time on this planet and I do that through ART and different businesses that help push my heart and that helped push other elements of my art so my person I like even though against it is my accountant and I'm not going to say her name because then y'all going to try to hire a two and then it's going to take her away from like doing my job but I just feel like this whole money thing in this world we live in in the way that money infects other people's lives and the way that money affects people's way that they move is is different for a lot of folks and you can think like I just need somebody to do my taxes and just do my bookkeeping but if you're somebody like me where money is not what drives you then you need somebody that's in the passenger seat with you and that's helping to read the GPS properly that one time I feel like I wanted to do this episode because I feel very fortunate to have been on both sides of this at more than one time in my life I grew up in a middle-class household with just a single parent and though I was not poor I was made very aware that my mother was working her ass off for us and not before like in obvious ways and not so obvious ways like my mother was working two jobs my mother was you know working at a nursing home on weekends doing a double shift and having to work at a specific kind of nursing home so that there wouldn't be a conflict with her other job you know and maybe the things that you said to find out as you get older like why would my mother working at a nursing home that was an hour and a half away so she'd have to get up at 4:30 a.m. in the morning like why wouldn't you just work at a nursing home down the street because she had to work at that nursing home because that nursing home wasn't going to ask questions about what she's doing during the week and vice versa and like she needed to be able to just get more income and that was a way that you could do it as a nurse like so early on like I have always been aware of just having to work hard for money like it was never presented to me that like getting money doing doing like something you like is for everybody like that like I got the fortunate opportunity to do that because I ended up like dancing and got paid for dancing and then I end up doing television stuff like that so like what was happening in my household for a very long time was like my mom working her ass off to get money at me as a kid like dancing around and getting money it was like in my adult life I see I like that can end up creating certain like dissension within my romantic relationships when you're in a romantic relationship with somebody who isn't getting money through their passion and you are it will never work I'm going to say this again if you are in a romantic relationship with a partner who is not getting money to their passion and you are it will not work and it if it if you're the person listening and it is working please tell me how I was working cuz I ain't never seen that work never and what I've seen having a lot of time is somebody is getting money in a way that they just decided is the only way that they can get the money and they're fine with it they've come to terms with it and then they meet you and you are getting money in a way that doesn't require any compromise of your soul or your spirit and it starts to eat away at them and they start to realize I can't be with you because simply being with you reveals to me all of the compromises I have made in order to get money that I maybe didn't even need to make but I just wasn't strong enough not to make and I realize it like I grew up for a long time and a household that was basically like my mom is having to work your ass off to make money but I was able to make money like doing my passion and there was a certain level of like descendants that we had between each other in that space and not I'm not even trying to shave my mom but it's just the reality of like but maybe I could have like made money like doing something I really really like but I didn't have that opportunity I don't have that access and not everybody has an access that part like somebody like you can't even be mad at yourself you can't even be mad at yourself that you didn't do that you didn't hold out to get money from your passion cuz you're the feed some people where you had to feed yourself or you had to just make a way so I sometimes we beat ourselves up about shit like that and we really didn't have an option but what happens is that a certain point when you have your awareness that's when I say that you got to get Constable out what you're doing to get your money and is it eating at you is it taking away from your Soleus. Containment your joy because if it is and you got to really make a concerted effort to shift and to figure out how to balance that out even if it's feeding your family excetera excetera find Spina pause in the day to give yourself joy that maybe is even related to money you know and you you got to start doing that because this world has become all about money and our survival become so based on our money and it's not equally distributed but what is equally distributed is time to 24 hours in a day and I know somebody listening right now is like yeah so you got to find some time with and then 20 hours to like steal your time back I'm serious even if you on the job when I was a temp I was in there like okay imma do your shit but I'm also going to write these forms and imma write these forms and then after I get off work I'm going to go performance on I need the formula spawns it was going to eventually help me to not have to go to do a goddamn temp job and so I am constantly just trying to figure out like ways in which folks who feel trapped and how they're getting money can get out in two places and spaces where they can get money how they want to because I do think our world would be so different if people were getting money doing what they loved it more people were getting money doing what they love we would have a more letting world I truly honestly believe that I really do because there's already a shady Shady people but when you are able to support Yourself by something that feeds you not just like monetarily but it also feeds you emotionally and Men you're just able to deal with things differently better with more ease your able to deal with your able to just manage like the slings and arrows that come at you in a different way and it really just changes your your Consciousness and the way that you interact with everything about this fucking life and money is this thing this currency that's been brought into our world it really disrupt that in a lot of ways it really does and sometimes it's like it's unavoidable unavoidable you can't do anything about it you feel like it's just something hanging over your head but I will tell you that even though I have money now I still make a very very conscious effort to make sure that I'm doing shit that ain't got shit to do with money so that I can keep a balance of how my spirit is interacting with currency I would exchange and with capitalism I make sure to do art for free I make sure to donate I make sure to spend time doing things that are about how much money I have but more so about just like in just enjoying enjoyment that's what stop and smell the flowers is about right went out there who like them if I just had this much money like everything will be perfect I'mma tell you now nothing is ever going to be perfect it might mean that you know you have a certain level of Peace about just your day today because you don't have that other stress on you it might mean that you have a certain security that you have for your kids and so that gives you a certain level of peace of mind and that is so true and real and I'm not taking any of that away but just always keep in mind that this money thing there are more problems attached to it that you may not know about and that the best thing you can do is never make it the center of how your lives don't make everything about how you possess the money make it about what you do with the money and that's really what defines the person you are but just an addendum how you get the money does matter because you don't want to feel bad about how you got the money because then no matter what you spend it on you're going to feel like oh shit I'm still a trashy ass person and that is really really important you got to be cognizant about what you're doing to get the money because if you're selling your soul to get the money if you are selling your spirit to get the money if you are killing the Earth to save yourself and it doesn't matter how much money you have because at the end of the day you will still be broken the podcast Network
