Two wrestlers glanced at each other did watch just break when he did but he's not breaking his diatribe the TV shows you've been filming you're an embarrassment all these Bright Lights looks like you're wrestling in the shopping mall so we're going to fix things and we're fixing to my way. I don't want any bullcrap for many of y'all for the next hour watch lays down the law he wants to rewind the clock take wrestling back to the days before the WWF started putting wrestlers and polka dots and other outlandish costume I want real wrestler not namby-pamby dance routines no more mats outside the ring that looks fake no more lewd hand gestures neither no more acrobatic flips off the ropes come on I want blood I want violence I want spontaneity give me that and we're going to win Big Y watches settling in a WCW WWF is in turmoil since the steroid Scandal erupted the bad news hasn't stopped coming Hulk Hogan's taking a break from The Ring to focus on acting big bands also falling out with the Ultimate Warrior the face painted wrestler he hoped would be WWF next Superstar on top of that to WWF staffers have been fired claims that they've been using their position to sexually exploit young men who wanted to get into the wrestling business there are also two potentially crippling lawsuits pending from a rookie wrestler left semi paralyzed after a match the other from a former commentator demanding hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid royalties and it's all hammering the ratings of WWF Stevie shows including Primetime wrestling it's October 1992 and Vince McMahon his top lieutenants are meeting in WWF headquarters in Stamford Connecticut for months they've been trying without success to revive Primetime wrestling ratings now McMahon wants to start over let's forget about overhauling Prime Time wrestling come on it's time to create a new show replace it I want something more in your face when executive rips on McMahon's idea why do we take the fights out of the Arenas and back into a small intimate venues put put the audience ringside and have the wrestlers doing their sketch right there instead of taping them separately it would feel like it slide to the viewers at home vice president of business operations picks up for the time yeah we can put my to the ring so the viewers here every grunden crash on the mat it'll feel unscripted like something uncooked raw McMahon Poinsett glove I like that sounds dangerous that should be the name of the show in January 1993 Monday Night Raw debuts and it's like nothing wrestling fans if ever seen before for the small venues live by than up close over the top action raw is a world away from the orchestrated atmosphere of most wrestling tv shoots the reaction is huge Ross first episode of attract more than 2 million viewers to shows drawing people back to WWF Ross success is a bitter blow for wcw's Boss what he thought gimmick free back2basics wrestling would work wonders instead viewers are choosing the WWF synergetic and Crazy Action over his dimly-lit TV shows but the cowboy

Broadcasting who oversees WCW and he's not happy as what's takes a seat shop pushes a sheet of paper across the desk at him you want to explain this Watts picks up the sheet of paper it's a faxed copy of an interview he did for a wrestling newsletter in 1991 a paragraph is marked with a yellow highlighter the part where watch defends a 1960s restaurant owner who opted to shut down his Atlanta Eatery rather than comply with a court order to serve African-Americans well I don't deny that I said that but anyone who thinks I'm a big is an idiot I believe in Freedom he should have the freedom to discriminate Shaw glares at what's the Cowboy gets the message you know what I'm done with this damn business I'm out its next 1993 and there's a new face in Shaw's office a guy who resembles a bulked-up Kendall he's Eric Bischoff and he wants to feel the Cowboys now empty boots on paper fish shop shouldn't stand a chance at becoming wcw's executive producer he's there promotions backup announcer a guy Solo in the pecking order that Shaw had never heard of him until his resume landed on his desk but Sean's curious he wants to know why Bischoff reckons he could run the show all right Eric this is your moment tell me how are you going to fix WCW Bischoff straightens up and makes this case the old ways won't work if I did all those Regional promoters the WWF wiped out and still be around we need to think like a TV production company not a wrestling promotion we need production values to match WWF and we can't just focus on the south to beat WWF we've got to think and act National show Notch. Ruiz wholeheartedly with Bischoff's analysis okay so how would you take WCW out of the red and into the black we cut back on live events every time we do when we lose money that's going to continue until we sort out the TV shows maybe we stop live shows all together Shaw Smiles he's impressed by Bischoff's bold ideas although he feels that stopping Live Events completely is a step too far a few days later Bischoff gets the job but now that he's talked his way into wcw's driving seat he's got to deliver its fall 1993 and Bishop is at Disney World in Orlando Florida but he's not on vacation instead he's touring Disney MGM Studios he's been hunting for a permanent TV shoot location for WCW for weeks and now he's found the ideal home its facilities are first-rate it's Disney World location means there will always be a studio audience on hand Bischoff also loves the WCW TV shows could open with the words coming to you from the Disney MGM Studios in Orlando Florida but he's getting ahead of himself he might want to bring wrestling to Disney World but Disney isn't sure it wants his muscle heads hanging around the Magic Kingdom a couple of weeks later Bishops back in Orlando trying to convince a conference room full of Disney Executives to let WCW through their Gates but it's not going well several of the executives turned around and if seats putting their backs to him Bischoff soldiers on I promise you that WCW is very much a family-friendly production it will be out of place in Disney World the Disney team look doubtful Bischoff can sense the opportunity slipping away from him but then out of the blue one Disney executive comes to the rescue I know this is outside our comfort zone but I think this could be good at the studio will be in constant use in generating income plus I think it will be an added attraction for guests the intervention defrost the room after more discussion the Disney Executives agree to let WCW use the studio but there are conditions we don't want wrestlers wandering around the theme park frightening our guests they get bust in and out each day and I don't leave the studio when here and the curtains on the bus Windows must be drawn so people don't see them arrive Bischoff interrupts I'll accept the rest but that's going too far the Disney Executives confirm briefly fine fine no curtains I think we have a deal getting into Disney World is a big boost for fish off but an even bigger boost is just around the corner thanks to Ric Flair earlier that year he quit WWF to rejoin WCW after McMahon started pushing younger wrestlers to the four it's December 1993 and flares in the living room of his Atlanta home button bags of ice on his strained muscles last night the branch wrestling star put in one of the greatest performances of his career a rollercoaster championship fight with rival wrestler Vader that had the audience of WCW starrcade Pay-Per-View on the edge of their seats as he applies another ice bag his phone rings he reaches over and grabs the handset this is Rick you nearly had me crying it was so good thanks hook what's going on Claire sings Back in the couch now we got this new guy in charge names Eric Bischoff he's got some really great ideas after a moment of silence Hogan response it's 2 in the morning the following day and Bischoff is awakened by a phone call Eric Bischoff speaking he recognizes the voice on the line immediately talk it spoken and he's about to give Bischoff in the WCW but leg up babe in frame for on the next episode Holcomb Mania comes to Atlanta Vince McMahon faces prison and Ted Turner declares all out War from wondery this is business Wars hope you enjoy this episode please subscribe on Spotify Stitcher Apple podcast Google podcast iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcast you'll find a link on the episode notes just tap or swipe over the cover art and you'll see some offers from our sponsors you can support our show by supporting them we hope you will like what you've heard we would love it if you give us a 5-star rating and tell your friends how to subscribe to have another way you can support this is by answering a short survey add one degree.
