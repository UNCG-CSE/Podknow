Thomasina Goddard became the first person to be laid to rest inside the Vault soon after the Vault was sold to the chase family they left mrs. goddard's remains inside out of respect and added one approaches its own daughter's Anna Maria Chase in 1808 3 years later her sister Dorcas with Joyner but her father joined them a few months later and 1812 a very strange sight greeted the mourners the coffins had moved around no matter how many times Masons and worker is stack them in an orderly manner and weld them up within the Crypt the heavy LED boxes would be strewn about the room bodies peering out here early from resting places that have been nailed shut this inexplicable phenomena has consumed Supernatural researchers for over two centuries but there's one element they all agree on the chase family secrets or even darker than the confined chamber where they're Restless confidence or cat dorcas's final meal on Earth had been roast Pig if she closed her eyes she could still feel the sweet stringy meat melting out her tongue the air would fill with that sweet salty perfect smell her bedroom would transform into the dining room the last few scrapings of mashed potatoes with smile at her proper pint she held onto the memory tightly as her body wasted away it had been a delicious last meal her father Colonel Chase had never taken or seriously he did not heater with praise like her Todd link sister dear departed Mary Ann Gillen needed to look at Dorcas for vile words to spell out they were as necessary to him as the air he breathed it seemed to be a compulsion she existed so she must be punished for 18 years Dorcas and praying to God for an explanation she asked her mother for an answer but her mother could do little to soothe her she explained that the colonel was a difficult man to live he delighted and violence and control in a way few men do her mother at clutch the banister she told Turkish this her Knuckles turning night she had to load the kernel there was no other option for her on this Plantation Colonel Chase was the son that his family's Duty was to revolve around him when she reached a certain age his harsh words were replaced with his fists he would hit Dorcas in a stomach until she bled giant bruises blue to her abdomen like the darkest of flowers and as the flowers grew larger and larger deeper and deeper Dorcas decided she was done revolving she was going to drop out of orbit instead her timing was deliberate her father was going away on business for exactly two weeks she had slept with him at his Farewell dinner to Muir silent the ideal picture of an idiom daughter still he used his fists on her again she smiled to the pain it was easy to smile now that you got a plan Colonel Chase wanted nothing more than to be seen as an important man like the neighboring waldrons his reputation was his life and nothing soil the reputation faster than the sudden death of a perfectly healthy woman of marriage age the family would be cloaked in Scandal the rumor best of all Dorcas would finally have the peace and silence that she had always wanted he was coming home today and she could already feel her body failing her she feared the pain he would inflict but some small part of her felt join he would see what you done he would see her final Triumph wasting away was the easiest thing she'd ever done she didn't eat she didn't drink she didn't speak she acted as though she were already dead and in a way she wants her skin a drone waxy and shallow her long brown hair was falling out in clumps she was no longer anyone's definition of beauty and that suited her quite well despite the heat of the island Sun Dorcas only breathed winter are ice creeping through lungs and over her skin when she walked her body shook with a feeling of cool water spilling over her head and down her limbs her sense of balance didn't float with the current on one occasion door cassette simply fall into the floor her body could no longer bear the weight of living the ground called her it's saying her ears at night asking her to make a warm blanket from layers of sand and dirt she would simply become part of the Earth it was sort of tempting Perma spot by the window she stared out at the shore she could picture driving her hands into the sand deeper and deeper until it covered her the fractured flashes of lightning and shards of shell wearing away what remained for skin if only she could get up and do it play desire to sink into the Earth to be ground down by time like sea glass on the shore would have to stay latched your chest and unattainable fantasy the only sign of her body's attempt to heal was the slow change of the bruises as the days creeped by her father's last marks of ownership on her transformed from dark purple to yellow green the house servants Fred it but they did nothing even the ones with raised her they'd never interfered she didn't expect them to her mother watched her die with a detached expression of Oz maybe even respect at least someone was escaping several days in the pangs that started the bruises had taken root under her skin and began to pull whatever nutrients were left from her body she could feel them digging deep giant thorns and twisting Roots slicing through by consuming her insides there were days when the pain made the entire world while out-of-focus salt would build up in your eyes with no moisture to form into tears she would Claude the skin on her face and the salt would linger seeping into new wounds today the pain was a reminder soon she would be free in a handful of hours everything would be gone the colonel made his grand entrance to the house even though she was in the upstairs parlor she could hear his stomping boots against the wood floors have a lower level he yelled at his attendance to remove his shoes and coat for him Dorcas waited she strained your ears to listen as he moved about the house he greeted his wife he didn't ask for his eldest daughter was perhaps she was already a ghost to him hours passed slowly her eyes were growing heavy with sleep death was on the horizon for her the boat was already skinny the shores then the colonel made his appearance you slapped her awake she took satisfaction in the way he wiped his palm oil have been coating your skin for the past week now there was a part of her sinking into his skin she hoped it would Fester they're eating away at him his face grew a boiling red as he screamed at her for being selfish and ungrateful your kisses eyelet screw having she was dreadfully tired Tremors sugarvine she slowly realized it wasn't the cold he was her father shaking her again and again he wanted you to wake up she did try she needed to see him she needed to watch him as he realized she had one her I would strained to open against the weight Center lashes suddenly she's slipped out of arms and down to the ground her vision finally returned coming to a sharp clearfocus he look like a storm above her full of electricity and anger his voice boomed around the room and then he was moving fast faster than he should his face near inches from her own screaming cursing shaking her over and over again. She knew more pain was coming his eyes drifted down to the spot where the wounds had taken root for stomach was empty but her belly looked. Wolin but the last signs of starvation the Cradle punch that are bruises again and again the flowers grow again and dark purple bursts erase his voice at or is he brought his hands down it was too much salt Creek that our eyes the fear had returned she gasps for air he kept up his tirade her hands reached for purchase on something anything that could save her from his reach he pulled away she was afraid of what would come next her heart raced like a Thundering Herd of horses Dorcas Doug at the floor for arms began to tingle pressure built in her chest she called for help she begged for someone to make it all stop and then mercifully it did Dorcas chase the oldest daughter of Colonel Thomas Chase was laid to rest in the family Vault on July 6th 1812 Colonel Chase was a violent slave owner and domestic abuse her with his eldest child as his favorite Target left without any means of Escape thanks to both our geographical isolation and her father's Financial control of her she took the only way out she could by starving yourself to death Colonel Chase would kill himself a month later he left no note but the rumors that swirled around the family as a result of dorcas's last Act

have been Disturbed lying on the floor and total disarray unnerved they write it all the coffin send quickly close the vault in 1816 the mausoleum was reopened for another burial it happened again the

remained only rumors among the townsfolk and the coffins kept moving as if waiting to share the chases trunature to anyone who would come down to listen but there's more than one way to reveal family secrets anuria wasn't there when her cousin Dorcas died Dorcas Ed Ritenour several letters pleading for help to escape her father owned or you had promised to visit but when she arrived on the shores of Barbados for cussing was already dead and buried curl Chase claims his daughter had suffered from a sudden wasting disease but a noria refuse to believe it Dorcas had never been sick even when the whole household was wracked with fever something was wrong and anuria was going to discover the truth both our family and servants offered to walk her to the mausoleum but she needed to do it on her own she had made a promise to her cousin and failed she owed Dorcas a proper Memorial and Penance before she would set out to find vengeance the rain was melting the dirt road turning it into sludge each step required more effort than usual as their slippers sink into the mud mud cake that I have every trash for driver suggested it might be best to come back another day she ignored him in the distance she heard Stone scraping against down The Peculiar sound on a dreary day far away from the work in the fields the great Mausoleum came into view its size was for boating jutting out of the ground Like a Rock of Ages her muscles tensed and tears came to her eyes the cousin she loved so dearly was now encased in stone shut off from the rest of the world she would never feel the rain against your skin or the wind on her face she was gone anuria heard a strange thump below and then a cold sensation seed upper legs anuria was sinking the mud was smiling her her shoes vanished into the churning Brown Mark that's an unseen Force dragged her down she kicked and pulled upwards but the mud pulled right back anuria call for help as our bodies slowly sank inch bike torturous an inch she fought her Paddock as her driver ran towards her he took her in his arms and wrenched her free of the thick viscous Earth he said around the stable sand beside the fence and looped her arm around his he would not let go of her until they reach the safety of the house Nuria was too rattled to protest she lost her bid at independence from now on if she wanted to visit the site of Dorcas is resting place she would have to do so with an escort she would be closely monitored in the house as Colonel Chase had suspicions about her judgment yet these limitations only strengthened to resolve while made supposed to over her I thought back to the mud it at helser's some tightly like an embrace the stone had been so loud calling almost crying exhaustion sank into her bones like a still digging into the Earth she longed for a bed and a few hours rest but the mud was caked on her legs making it hard to walk a major of the path to help her escape the plaster like cast of her limbs her legs burned as she lowered herself into the hot water the mud fell away exposing red and swollen flash beneath Jagged claw like marks slid down her limbs where they might have been anuria close your eyes rest in your neck against the lip of the clawfoot tub a shaky side left her lips she was inside she was safe again rain pounded against the windows she turned her head to examine the storm outside there was a woman in the distance a shadow through the pouring rain her skin looked sallow almost transparent she was so small away from clothes so loose they look like a shroud some part of annoying new deep inside but it was Dorcas but before she could call out or look closer the figure was gone swallowed by the torrential downpour a chunk of stone broke through the window anuria tried to sit up in the tub to look at the stone but her body would not respond she felt it tents and freeze a strange sensation spreading through her lens her skin cooled and hardened growing still cold as Stone anuria filter Stone climbing up her shoulders and towards her neck she scream for help for vocal cords for solidifying the scraper don't against Stone was coming from her own mouth now the maid came back in she screamed it shocked the porcelain picture she had been carrying fell and shattered lenoria staring at her her head Frozen in place as granny find upper skull She Could Feel the Rush of the ocean in her years has she been swallowed by the Sea she was cold the rain was pelting her in the face she shivered her feet slick on the ground the ground the way you looked around yourself your surroundings had transformed around her she wasn't in the bath she was outside she felt a towel close around her the maid rubbed her shivering limbs trying to restore some feeling she look back towards the house the window in the main bathroom had been broken her own hands were crusted with mud and small rocks her fingernails were broken and torn off and some places in or you screamed then she fell unconscious her and told her the story and pieces not wanting to overwhelm her too much at some point I know he had broken through the window she wandered towards the mausoleum anuria I had torn at the stone with her hands when that didn't work she'd picked up branches and other pieces of stone she climb to the top of the mausoleum and lifted the stone over her head bringing it down over and over again but made at Founders staggering back towards the house I know where you wanted to accept the explanation but something was bothering her the shards of glass from the broken window around the inside of the house not of the terrorists there were deep scratches on the porcelain floors as if great Stones had moved across them she pointed these things out but her aunt wouldn't listen to her no one would so anuria trudged upstairs to her room she wiped aloe on her cuts and scrapes trying to take solace in the small markers of civilization the wooden floor in massive bed frame soft sheets and beautiful floral patterns she was alive she was safe the floorboard started to shift that's the light touch them the color is slowly drain from the room around her a gray waves spreading across the walls on or you'll get her fingers to the plaster at even the softest touch they turn to Stone she pulled her hand back quickly the room began to shrink somehow she moved from the safety of the large house with its broad open windows and softwood to a hard small space with stone boxes anuria was inside the mausoleum itself the stone door was wide open behind her Casting ambient Moonlight into the 2 one of the heavy cotton Lids lift it up dirt crusted fingernails slid through the Gap scraping along the led the Boney Fingers grip tight as a dark shape Rose throwing the heavy litter side completely the bloated and blue body of Dorcas climbed up toppling forward and then sliding towards a cousins feet Dorcas tried to pull her body out but her legs were too decayed to sustain her weight she collapsed again horrified anuria been to the ground and helped your cousin hop Dorcas smiled at her sweetly serenely so glad you could join me she said as the stone doroslych shut to get all lights and all wind left leaving only the scraping of lead Stone Supernatural experts folklorists and even the chases own contemporaries have theories to explain the mysterious moving coffins of Barbados an earthquake could create enough for us to knock the lead conference from the resting places however earthquakes and not particularly common in Barbados or the Caribbean at large and there were no recorded Quakes or resulting tsunamis in the summer of 1812 even if the earthquake simply wasn't recorded it's unlikely that a Tremor would have only hit the area next to the church the area could have flooded the rising water levels could have pushed the conference up and move them around then when the water lowered the coffins would settle a different positions but no one could find any evidence of lingering moisture or water damage in space a fine layer of sand was dusted over the entrance to help detect any robbers attempting to enter the mausoleum but the sand was undisturbed in all of the deceased's valuables remained in place a large economic disparities it was hard to imagine why someone would break in but not take anything from the bodies the locals however had a much different interpretation of events than the white colonizers who had forcibly taken their Island both Dorcas and Colonel Thomas Chase eventually committed suicide many locals believe that this was the true reason for the moving coffins the other bodies didn't want to be next to those who had perished by their own hand and we're trying to force the conference out of the Tomb it was one last painful and Justice Dorcas still could not find safety or understanding in death coming up a man of God seeks to free the spirits in the chase Vault of their burdens but who will free him when he realizes he's locked inside now the conclusion of our story it's important to note that while the chase Vault was a very expensive family plot it stood in the Town Cemetery the shifting of the chase confidence was well-documented especially for early 19th century colonial event because the phenomena was happening right below the feet of the townsfolk many citizens of Christ Church view the strangeness is a local Oddity nothing more but other is such a help to understand but they're Restless Dead do not wish to be comprehended they only wish to be heard and sometimes joint Church Rector Thomas H Artisan normally took great pride in his work he calm the fears of his congregation regarding storms and famine he spread the word of the Lord throughout the islands he baptized newborn since shepherded departed souls to Heaven There were far worse places to do the Lord's work, it's found the beaches and balmy Barbados son to his liking he felt grateful that God had chosen him for this task or at least he had before he perform the service for Colonel Chase before the coffin have begun to move his parents had been faced with a challenge from Beyond the Grave it was his duty his purpose in life to Rise Above This obstacle and Sue this fuck Yeti found himself troubled two suicides Two Souls that have been casted to limbo it was a tragedy but these particular deaths had larger consequences slaves on the island believe that those who struggle to find peace in life would be denied peace and bath those who had died by Suicide would be cast out by other spirits kid giving no Credence to such a pagan notion but the conference had moved repeatedly audibly bodies have been tossed to the ground like rotten fruit in a sealed room she could think of no Godly explanation and so we began to investigate the potential work of the devil he'd seen the conference itself during another burial but tops have been thrown from several of them a small child's quarts half decomposed lay on the floor with its patchy skin and green color it look more like a discarded Play Nothing But a former person imma said gently raised the child's body to his chest part of the little boy's leg crumbled in his hands time had warned the bones down to paper there was another corpse on the floor the flesh had been plucked away leaving large spots of barebone couldn't identify the gender or age of this lost soul there were no personal markings left just a husk Thomas began his investigation shortly after Nightfall he sat on the bolts cold floor next to the two corpses Thomas prayed for their salvation he prayed for himself to find a way to help these people something grazed the nape of his neck sending a shiver down his spine it felt like a fingernail pushing to a skin he jumped up and Whirled around no one was behind him only one of the heavy coffin sitting still Thomas rub the back of his neck his fingers came away with a spot of red on them blood he told himself that he'd only put his head back too far and cut himself on the jagged lived he resumed his Blessing taking it a bit too fast when he returned home Thomas prayed for God to keep him safe from any that might do him harm, said just drifted off to sleep when it started a bumpy deepen redneck he stayed in his bed waiting for the sound to die off instead it grew louder when you could take it no more Thomas toss the covers aside and went rooting around his small residence there was no stranger at his doorstep no mice patterning across the floor boards no gusts of wind sitting and shutters you search the house for loose books are baubles that might be knocking around the cupboards again he came up empty in a fit of frustration, see that knelt down by the floorboards to listen to the Earth but it wasn't the ground the sound seem to be moving his eyes started to water his limbs grew heavy he was beyond exhausted without proper sleeve Thomas would never be able to deliver his 5 a.m. sermon with a bigger it demanded he leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes when the sound finally stopped his heart beat took over the same staccato Rhythm pulsing through his body as he gave his sermon that morning he could hear the noise racing around his skull let us out get them out there was something in that tomb it had been waiting he had tempted the devil and the devil had answered back in the form of a pagan Legend in order to taunt him Thomas spent the day in his office he tried to write his sermons but each stroke of the pen sounded like a heavy bump of stone of vein in his forehead bulge that the sound it's an Agony that would have no peace physical or spiritual until the spirits were freed the noise escalated as he stepped outside she crossed the graveyard to the chase family fault the sight of his many woes he had prayed inside and the wrong thing that hurt him he could fix this he just needed to enter the belly of the Beast once again the door to the fault was closed firmly he could hear voices Whispering on the other side of it they were mocking him you didn't know if they were devils are spirits or something in between but he did know that he could not let them win he crossed himself and then open the vault silence it has been hours since you been able to sit in Stillness coffins laid on the ground open again Dorcas and Colonel Chase's bodies looked almost Serene he said a prayer for the souls Thomas turn to the walls he called for forgiveness for Darkness to be cast out in all sins forgiven in the name of their lord and savior it worked he left with relief the Lord's power had been enough he felt a weightlifting from his body he bought the devil at 1 from the top of the Vault keeper run playing soft at first but building Thomas pulled back towards the entrance the mausoleum shook he collapsed to the ground beside one of the heavy coffins he didn't see it rolling down onto him until it was too late the last opening up a Chase fault occurred on April 18th 1820 after several complaints that there was a sound coming from inside the mausoleum Governor the island Lord comprimir decided to investigate the site for himself aided by two other high-ranking men Lord combermere descended upon the tomb inside the coffins have been shuffled around once more this was perplexing for two reasons one because the coffins were made of lead and required 6 men to carry them into place and two because Mason said carefully sealed the Tomb in 1819 before sealing the entrance shut the Mason said ensure that the coffins had all been restored to their proper positions within the mausoleum after the opening in 1820 Lord combermere declared that the mausoleum itself should be sealed permanently the coffins were buried in the ground beside the two and have stayed in play ever since the Vault was never opened again did the separate barrels of a Chase family and their problems in the afterlife it's possible Dorcas and criddle Chase were moved out of the Vault and buried separately stacked on top of each other even in death Dorcas could not Escape her father but there's an even darker question to contemplate here the chase family was known for their cruelty they were said to be some of the most vicious slave owners on the island of Barbados and Dorcas his father reveled and torturing his own family perhaps another source soft fit to meet out its own form of Justice it denied the family their desired resting place one that had been purchased with blood money instead they would be buried in the ground like everyone else our family histories never die with us as much as we wish to hide our secrets they leave stains on the land Erie pockets of pain and suffering the chase fault is surrounded by one of the most beautiful environments in the world and yet standing beside it is said to make the blood run cold even in the warm Caribbean Breeze so when the sounds of lead on Coral drown out the white-capped waves be wary
