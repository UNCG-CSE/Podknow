anything that helps you buy and sell it is the number one skill set that 99% of my audience needs because you're always doing it in one way or another garyvee audio Experience episode 323 of the Ask Gary Vee show we're going to go call heavy so if you're watching a LinkedIn right now Central playing with LinkedIn live pretty heavily right now. Please put in your phone numbers and the end and we will be taking calls from LinkedIn 40 just I got ittrying to make up for the fact that we are a hard 12 minutes behind all because of you I just want to make sure I was here I'm really excited we have some really fun videos on the internet from 7/8 10 years ago she has a new book so we're promoting that would love for people to say this before we get into it before Marie tells the people that are watching about herself that don't know her I always think about what I do for a living which is I have this need for some reason to Des rapports Lee disproportionately overshare what's working for me quickly at scale and I think through the karma points whatever you know all this money I leave on the table place out in perpetuity cuz I think I'm talented enough to grab it and I also don't really have a model that's more on my audiences for live separate companies and it's funny I wouldn't even think this we were hanging out cuz Dustin is 12 minutes late with it but it didn't have an exploded stomach but so I was thinking about that I wasn't thinking about this before but literally as this has just started the thing that came to my mind is what are things I've always really respected about you raise I really remember vividly that you were one of the first people I remembered like I'm like oh she's actually executing on what I'm saying at every time I hang out with her with her to come to some weird apartment in New York was her studio is or if I see her in LA and her house were randomly she's thoughtful like like I think she in this was almost like a compliment to myself to you I'm being serious yet I remember vividly remember thinking I'm like oh she knows that I'm up to something yeah she's listening but unlike 99.9% she's in executing and the lot of ways you would have done had I never existed you would be exactly where you are but the road has always been a little bit of a nice feeling in my stomach because I think you really listen then you executed I mean that's the thing I have my head down more than anything else you know and I love who you are I love what you do and somebody sent it to me last night or stop there like you're you're really generous I'm like I just give a fuk I give lots of fox and I care and when people around me that I see are doing great work I want to do everything I can to spread their message so when your books came out or something new you were doing and I said hey I have a platform it might not be the same size or scale as yours but it's different and I want to expose people to great idea that they can actually use to improve their business in life and that's my goal in life for you to tell the audience now about yourself I like to tell everybody about the book yet because one thing I'm proud of his unlike me who doesn't who learns more an audio and visual a lot of my audience learn from reading and I think books are inexpensive for the ROI for people that learn that way I can never read a book on the record but everyone learns different and the numbers we want to go in the questions once you frame up those two things I want people to call in put in your phone number go to LinkedIn if you're not on there if you want to question to keep watching on whatever stream you're watching right now it's at putting your phone number questions Rockoff is going through those as we speak but I want the questions to be a little bit predicated on what you're about the frame-up so who are you and then what's this book about so for me entrepreneur author and I like giving back so I say philanthropist not in the way that I'm Warren Buffett been in the way that I like to use my resources my platform my financial resources to aim it towards things I feel that we should improve in this world in some small way so I start off my journey on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange I have a lot of energy I knew I could never sit behind a desk in about six months into that job that was like 1998 and just knowing the culture of Wall Street to begin with yam and obviously America by God starting to progress a little bit and boy girl conversations must have been a real Baptist but I can't even imagine the sheer amount of Politically Incorrect things that must have happened to you within the first week I mean I was battling consoling it was hey you want to hang out it was here after work strip clubs Coke all the stuff I have long hair I actually cut off all my hair to be exactly like yours because I tried to get taken more seriously that's how much I was babbling so I started hearing this voice inside that was like Maury you are not meant to do this outside of all that bullshit I knew that other things going completely one of the things that was a clue was that a lot of things more because you could handle it yeah and you understood you can professional navigate it completely. I'm tough right I'm very sensitive but I'm also very tough cuz I want what I want and whatever I need to do in order to achieve and grow and experience what I want experience I'm willing to put myself through so that was not a problem but I also have a really strong sense of intuition and when something's not right my body repulsed literally on the floor they change because I've been ignoring this voice of Lake Murray you're not supposed to be here this is not your Life Path one day I walked into my job and I started having only what I can identify as like a little mini panic attack feeling like shitt I told my boss hey I need to go get some coffee I made a beeline to the nearest church cuz I graduated from Seton Hall University so I was kind of trained in a crisis to look up and ask for help so I'm sitting on the church steps bawling my eyes out feeling at The Biggest Loser because I'm the first in my family to go to college my parents busted their ass to get me an education there High School educated and here I am wanting to quit a stable job with health benefits and all the stuff were you a huge Terry dehere fan I'm so pissed all basketball and yes clearly did not go into the Pirates who did 94 to 98 I was I was hoping it was a good basketball program so I'm crying on the church steps and I pull out my flip phone because that's what we had back then and I call my dad because when I felt so guilty I didn't want to disrespect my parents and quit this job when I don't have any other way to make a living and I was certainly not going to go back home and my dad told me when the most important things I've ever heard he said look you've work since you are 9 years old I'm not worried about you keeping a roof over your head or putting food on the table but you are going to work for the next 40 50 years at least if you don't find something that you love so much you're going to be miserable so quit this job take as long as you need to find that thing that you feel you're meant to do and it's all going to come together so that permission slip for me sent me on an odyssey to figure out who the hell I was and what I was meant to do all I knew was that I was highly creative and I also loved business but those two things didn't seem to mesh back then like I originally wanted to be an animator for Disney or fashion designer and I also love my dad as a small business owner I love the way he treated his customers was a printing business going weekends and nights to work with him and just loved his work ethic that's what inspired me so I tried magazine publishing I was in Cotton as Publications in the ad sales department is that okay this is new to this is amazing six months in those boys came back like this is still not what you're meant to do and I started panicking cuz I felt like a loser I was like I'm so ambitious I want to make money I want to make a difference but I fucking hate what I'm doing and I look that nice at do I want to actually be the publisher like do I want to climb the corporate ladder know and I said what am I wasting my time and their time for said maybe I'm still too on the business side numbers heavy let me try something more creative editorial side I hustle my way into getting a job as a fashion editorial assistant at Mademoiselle magazine unlike this is got to be at I'm going to fashion shows highly creative working on photo shoots this is going to be amazing to be to 6 months and that's exactly right and I was like what now I really started to panic because every single one of my friends they were getting raises promotions like starting an ad salt life and here I was a like feeling like the biggest loser I graduated valedictorian and yet I can't seem to hold down a job cuz I keep quitting one day I was on the internet when I probably should have been and I stumbled upon this new profession of the time was an article I read and it was about coaching which again I'm 23 in my mind I'm saying this is the cheesiest dumbest thing you've ever came across Who the hell's going to hire 23 old life coach you're a loser you've got mountains of debt what do you thinking and yet in my heart or something said this is who you are I signed up for a three-year coach training program at night to my studies at night worked at Mademoiselle during the day I got a call from the HR department we have a promotion for you going to Vogue More Money More Prestige more everything that was my fork in the road to say okay are you going to stay on the safe path with health benefits people understand what you do for a living it's respectable all that catch it or quit and start this weird coaching business at 23 what you have no idea how to do Europe mountains and mountains in debt and nobody even understand what this is so I quit my city job I went back to bartending and waiting tables and I spent the next seven years figuring out how to build a coaching business from the ground up that's a very long story to the stigma of the bad coaching environment well that didn't exist yet because I was in early the only people that existed in the space were basically Tony Robbins that was the only known figure at that time just thinking about them even that model absolutely know that I kind of over road that what my insecurities yeah but I was also in Sy was insecure about my age but I had hit so many walls failing on Wall Street failing and Publishing trying all these different things that was a couple fuck it If none of those things working have to try this because it feels right and beat what are my other options way up yes yes I put a lot of pressure in my opinion of like my own concerns of the deep coaching and remind ecosystem I hate it how I don't know this how you feel like you have an answer for me yeah has there been conversations of the evolution of that we're we're the most advanced and Progressive and kind strategist and coaches and masterminds have talked about the notion of giving people money back and not letting people in it like the only way to offset this model so many people bottom feed and they know it yes my problem this is why I never wanted to monetize my audience is why I could probably build the biggest one is because I don't want to put in the time to refund or vet I don't think I'm good at wedding but I'm not going to wedding and I think the way that the coaching Mastermind industry needs evolved is not bottom feed and I think 80% of your Comics are built on that in the macro I don't know if it's been yet but here's what I did for my own self and maybe this can be instructive so after I built skills as a coach working with people one-on-one which by the way I did for free for so long because I didn't that's how you win and listen I bartended waited tables to put a roof over my head so I could just deliver value to people and improve my ability to help them create change without any expectation of a check for the crap I got it so here's my model now I don't work with people one-on-one I don't do masterminds I don't do any of that shit I love education no because like books are form of Education all that stuff so the flagship program that we have a just called peaceful here's how I operate because I hate all that shit we have a refund policy that we've always had if you actually go into the program and you show us that you've done the coursework in two weeks if you hate it you think we fucking suck we give you 100% of your money where your absolute lie talk to me about what this books about everything is figureoutable are the three word phrase that has been the single most powerful driving force in my life got me out of a toxic relationship in high school help me get out of debt help me get every job I've ever had help me build the company I have today which for me is my ideal company I love what we do it is a simple phrase that helps people ignite their innate wisdom and do anything they want to fucking do this world and what about from a business standpoint is this I don't know this yet is this the first third the second book I read a book like over a decade ago that was honestly like a little published or published by someone all three I started off as an e-book when nobody even though it looks more like a PDF as a buck was like my blind then I self-published it and I went to like Ann Arbor Michigan I didn't I didn't do vanity shit I actually saved us want to be book yeah go the route that everybody got caught in back then there was a super expensive or no it wasn't one of those tomorrow series actually Gary bartending like I went to a bartending shift I work my tail off downstairs downtown and I came home and somebody bought my ebook from Spain and I was like I could make a difference to someone on the other side of the world that I've never met yes that that was what got you started the first one is called make every man want you or make yours want you more how do you know you're barely keep from dating yourself it was funny it didn't 16 languages but after I self-publish it in a Big Apple's one of their best books of September and their most recommended listen or download from the audio version yes of course I see Mercury because I'm from Jersey and she gets real rough and it's so we go oh oh of course for the Jersey Murray Parts before things I have your attention in culture okay could be yep yep I think people are starving for Joy starving for Joy like whenever I done anything on socially which by the way I just want to give a shout out to your team because I'm working with your team who's coming around with me on tour we're having so much goddamn fun and I've never been a document over create thing. But so I Am Naturally goofy in life so yesterday I'm in Orlando I'm dancing in the bookstore in the airport because that's how I really am I am not performix you show your book in there and it has sold it to a woman saw me and she was like what's this book and I said it's an amazing book you should get it she's like I will buy it right now in like hand-to-hand combat XL tell her that it was News gas acting as if it wasn't me I need to try that on our next stop cuz I love them up selling yet I was like okay if the person takes me they're going to feel guilty to buy it yet I have to see if I can sell this is a customer like a human that was pretty funny when you should get it and didn't get it well I'll tell you the first time I walked into Barnes & Noble on Tuesday when it came out and we did this amazing video but this guy was like totally didn't know what to make of being like you should get the spoken he's like no no no I don't need anything in my life and I was like all right fine I'll get the NEX box anyway so I think people are starving for joy and I think the second thing I think people have to still pay really close attention to how much they're consuming versus creating so I give people a mantra create before you consume socials amazing all that stuff there's a lot of info coming at us if people don't shift that ratio know that's so obviously something I'm passionate about which is What's led me to deeply spending a lot of time on parenting and insecurity and worried about how they look the word about a comment they're worried about so much which is bulshit anywhere going to be something I said we're all going to be dead in a hundred years or less we're going to be powder you have to stop giving a fuck Kelly really focused on being 144 so I'm trying to do you think I don't seriously I was just going to know why I have scary numbers in their future in terms of longevity yeah I think I'm real pissed if you're 14 right now I'm super envious yeah cuz I think a buck-fifty is not out of the question I agree I'm shooting for 120 personally what are you shooting for for real is it 100 because I think we're far like like like we don't get the full benefits of all the technology and science advancements not you know we're not twenty-five you and I should like I take 120 I just don't think there's enough time take away all the other things but by the way here's a good news I failed all my science classes I speak with conviction on a lot of topics I have no fucking idea what we're talking about right now in random headlines overhearing much about science talk to me yeah I'm looking at my jeans too and on my mom's side like Mike I was just with my grandmother man she's a fireball she's 92 in trouble like my mom said not so great and like I'm bad and like I'm like but I'm hoping resources I hope I can do some weird like Walt Disney shouldn't like fries myself and I come out in 30 33 and be like I told you I was right I will happen if he didn't come back at with R6 cost of muscles and Tick Tock I think about LinkedIn anything Twitter today is everything just want it it's the only platform as a chance to be the next Instagram and so I take it seriously except buying DNA Brittany Marie oh my God I'm amazing and this is and I don't even know where to start family time to get into Universal Consciousness and I am struggling because I truly believe I wanted a friend and I'm trying to get into intelligent and I'm at a point now where I quit my full-time job and I'm halfway through my savings and I'm totally fine with no waitressing or doing that side hustle I am I'm totally willing to humble myself but I don't know trying to assess my Valley I feel like I have Alex to bring and I'm really reaching out to people and I'm willing to learn but you know what my love I'm going to interrupt you and I'm so sorry for that but I want to get to the answer cuz I know this so well I would encourage you absolutely to get that freaking job because when you're busy and we're near hustling and you have that money coming in you build confidence and when you have confidence you build all kinds of momentum so you already bring Valley of the World by the fact that you're alive now you're just going to amplify that by doing your work and getting it out there in a bigger way but I'll tell you if you're halfway through your savings you don't want to be done when it comes to your finances and when it comes to building a whole new career or whole new business if that's my own recommendation to you I had side gigs for like 7 years before I was emotionally confident and financially confident to go all in on what I want to do plus it was awesome I met so many people so that's my perspective on it. I don't know what you want to say to really think about and I completely agree with Marie and you see the practicality that answer I think the thing that is also happening is the I think this is what we're both jumping on the fact that you brought up within the first 10 words I'm halfway through my savings is already at L4 me like I'm a good poker player in real life not an actual poker I already now know that that's in your subconscious so you're not able to go all-in because you got this little thing going on in the back which I love about you because you're being fully practical you're not on some some crystals going to come out of the UFO and go in my eye and I'm going to solve the world or at least you got a good framework I agreed Marie I'm going to say something else is going to collide some my world I love the idea and this may not be in you but if it is one of my favorite reasons of pushing people to flip sports cards sneakers thrift store garage sale things is the following the reason I'd rather you make $15 an hour buying t-shirts at a thrift store or buying something else dollar store in selling it for 11 bucks is because your biggest issue right now potentially is figuring out how to contain it create a container for your value as a merchandise that container to make dollars right and what's amazing about flipping and eBay and you know all these secondary offer up in Etsy and Craigslist is you are required to figure out the audience one of the things that people don't understand is how how big of a difference in value the reason you see auction prices all over the place is not just because of your rating on eBay it's because how you wrote the headline how you took the picture and the words you put in it like there's a very specific reason why I always sold things on eBay better than my friends and contemporaries is cuz I'm good at positioning things and I feel like you practicing flipping stuff may actually help you up figure out how to put yourself into a container and merchandise it and that skill-set you pick up I didn't do it the only reason that I'm any good at what I do and I have any success is because I realized early on Britt that if I didn't get just as good at sales and marketing as I am at the craft of what I do which is helping people create change my fucking dead in the water yes or you're limiting your upset lately because a great product will find its way up to level it support I think I think also you're going to a heady place right it's crippling to think like I value for the world AG what does that mean so two things I definitely think you need to be making money on the side cuz it's very clear to me that that's the overlining issue and number to anything that helps you buy and sell it is the number one skill set than 99% of my audience needs because you're always doing it in one way or another doesn't make sense awesome thank you so much you have no idea how much this means to me thank you resigned after seven years I wait a minute I'm not an entrepreneur you're going to have to sell yourself to an employer like there's like everybody should practice that crap obviously like singing and basketball and dancing some can actually do it but if you can get better at it which you can get better at anything's yes it's one of the best things to get good at night Franklin Franklin got it Franklin new album Marie forleo how are you how's it going really well what can we help you with what I was going to ask is basically should I pay somebody 5 to $10,000 to help me set up my business model or should I just keep pumping out content and content in Charmed does strategically placed at places for it to get me to where I'm trying to think we should tell you your business model here for free in the next three minutes what are you selling are you personally developed I have been working on myself for the past 10 years and are you happy as fucking fulfilled to the more than $600 this year and this has been the happiest I've ever been in my entire life. I love you ready for that why buy spray I have over what it really boils down to is because I'm actually feeling purpose for a while and not feeling you know depressed in all the negative things I'm actually on a mission now that's the different actions you've been doing that make you say that what has been the actual tangible day-to-day life that makes you be able to say that I'm outside the grand just specifically cuz every day I wake up and I feel you know it was empowered to do something to get my message out there and you know I asked I would have never I would have woke up and then like you know another doggy day but nowadays when I wake up I'm let's get it let's go and I'll stay up till 2 in the morning get to 3 hours sleep and then after that I'm ready to go again or not paying anyone 10 or 12 or $15,000 to help figure out your business model that is number one you just got to think what is the problem that I am helping people solve and how am I doing it so are you selling one on one coaching services are you going to sell a particular weekend experience we were teaching people specific silk skills that help them solve a specific problem you don't need to worry about any of this paying other footage of a yeah because a lot of people don't they like the idea of it but they're not good at selling to other people or like me don't want to do that or are you going to start a brand like life is good saying I need to slap t-shirts together with that saying posted on Instagram and God forbid for some weird reason it resonated and everybody bought it and you might build an apparel business crash this you should have doing Murray's way or my way you should do it your way you know she's going yeah but absolutely but we got to figure out what the business my lies you keep sharing your message you keep doing that but you got to do the work on your own to figure out what is the business that you're going to have the best chance of being successful at something that you're going to want to work mornings Nunes and nights and weekends to make successful like Gary said it could be an apparel company it could be something completely different but you just got to keep doing you but business is separate I think than just sharing a message out there a lot of people want a quote-unquote monetize a message I'm not into that shit is not exactly how do you want to what I was asked people my friend Franklin how do you want to make money tell me what if if I was a genie from the fucking future would you like to make money you know I haven't actually thought of that question I just more less was looking at it from you know as long as I'm helping people that's more fulfilling yes and if you're able for whatever reason to live on making $600 a year then fucking you one I just want to make sure that's the truth that's Me Maybe maybe you make 10 trillion before you started this maybe maybe you're willing to couch-surf for the rest of your life through people's Goodwill I just need to know that it's sustainable well I would definitely rather be making a lot more money than $600 a year do you know why are you able to afford making $600 a year because it pushes like each ship you're now challenging my ship Mendoza Line cuz I don't think I was talking about $600 a year that's even that's happened shittier than shit like why why did you save a lot of money are you are you a trust fund baby like help me here now I know why you're so happy you should have a huge Factor Why you waking up everyday Paul. and I'm not allowed to stay on parents all the time so she pays the bills and gets me like $100 a week to feed the kids and the parenting is massively fulfilling free to you huh have you seen any this content do you know what I'm saying do you know that I think that I want you to go to a thrift store right now look up everything on eBay buy something for 4 and sell it for 49 have you ever tried it I haven't but I'm willing to bet it's helping me you know I'm helping build her and she's helping me grow also miles telling her you know of that's probably just make sure that everything is practical and I think you'll be okay I think you're you're in the starting phases of something good just make sure that ideology doesn't take over for execution you have to do less what you're going to do yes less strategies more doing 3 to 4 days ago you see flipping works you needed to be in a thrift store garage sale you better garage sale this Saturday Franklin you better fucken garage sale tomorrow he's amazing this is all wrapped up I'm in because Dustin fucked up everything that's what the amount of time and so now you have to personally by those stats in you're in for it everything is figureoutable brother figure it out hello Amanda how are you oh my God yes you did it 50 Grand my first your Consulting as a side gig and carry I listen to you everyday I can't believe it I felt temperature because I tell you I did not know you have you had the chance of l'impact you know like that subconsciously you can't like it's I see it all the time like there's people who've loved somebody for 27 years yeah they see one video of mine that makes them break toxic boyfriend and then that questions ask Gary cuz it's for people like heart like when people come through my program and that's why I require that they do they're fucking homework because of this because when they actually take those actions they can get the results anybody who actually does what I'm telling them to do wins every time every time he who uses it to make them feel like they're doing something lives I'll be willing to be patient my big fear my biggest concern right now in my world guess is they watch me I didn't you know I occasionally do the post where it says stop fucking watching me and go do yep never listen to many gallons go Dukes I want them to win absolutely they are not ready to do so what they do is they unfollow me and what they do is they go to a Spam version of being consumed that so I'm trying to figure out my Cadence with this cuz I'm trying to get them to do I have an idea for you so I hate stop listening to right now go come back this fucking step and then but but can you reward them somehow can there be able to come back because I'm not naturally they go to the spam version but we need to say that and I think it's super fun to have people go and do some shit and then come back it's fucking talk about you know why so they can get addicted to the doing what I think is fun what Amanda yes I think Amanda's dinner conversation in three weeks with her friends is give me the latest news let me tell you what happened in a couple weeks ago yes yes to this random question I thought going with the truth is always the right answer a snow sometimes there's a different game and play Gary hangs up with me and never ever do I have that chance to speak to both of them again that's like you're always learning kids might they can see by the book I'm and I'm going to randomly call you in a couple weeks to make up for hanging up on you because it doesn't feel good with me but it's a fun way to end the Shell Gas weight and let's do you want to do a giveaway for some fun fucking stickers like Jersey marine store tice's copies of everything that for anyone watching or listening right now if there's any piece of them that doesn't believe they have what it takes to do the thing that they want to do to actually leave this up to you guys because it's your platform a lot of different ways we're definitely giving one to Amanda and yes can you personalize this one will shirt and then we'll figure out a couple start before you're ready is it this camera which one which one would I look at 11 start before you're ready there's Jersey Marie no more bulshit excuses that's fun and it's a Tropicana orange because this is the thing that my mom is her most prized possession in Jersey she got it for free and it was the thing that she fixed that got me this idea it was awesome and make sure you've subscribed because a bunch of you aren't subscribed and more poorly a bunch of you listen every day and haven't told your friends it's the best podcast in the world I'm watching have a great day
