hi there it's Michael Lewis here you probably know that against the rules is the first podcast that I've ever done and it probably shows so I appreciate all of you for sticking with it the first season's over but we want to give you something a little extra as a token of appreciation the writer Malcolm Gladwell and I had a conversation back in April of 2019 when against the rules had just launched we met in front of a live audience at the 92nd Street Y which is this great center of culture and Jewish life on the upper east side of Manhattan where the big crowd and the whole thing was a lot of fun to do and we talked about how I got interested in not just podcast but the quandary of referees in American Life we want to give you a little peek behind the curtain they're producing the show and also a glimpse of the next season of Malcolm's podcast revisionist history thank you thank you Malcolm for doing this I just got my apologies to the audience I'm the reason this is late is on subway every time you do some new project you drop me out to interview you and I feel like this is like my first time doing this but I've done it is much for you and I'm going to have to do in September apparently last time we were mortally offended you and I got all kinds of angry angry but kind of offensive should be here tonight send me an email saying I didn't you know I pursued particular lines of uncomfortable and create with too much bigger will be nice this evening nasty Malcomson for the side and we're just going to get nice and I'll come let's talk about for the record I don't remember any of that that I didn't get it I really don't remember any of that pleasure to speak with that is a great ability to sell the most unbelievable bullshit and any that you did it you did it with me the last time and I don't want to suggest I was offended in any way but Jesus Christ Malcolm what you think you're doing well what a what a fantastic wasp you are you and by the way you're probably the only one in this room your abilities are kind of like Nazi and dismissing explain why conflict is quite extraordinary let's get back spent much of my life is the only wasp in the room and it was about being the toy go about being the one and go away and Everything Jewish institutions made everybody feel comfortable nobody cared what I thought I can work on Passover obvious questions that you're going to get it every time you do any kind of media they're going to ask you this question so I thought I'd see this transition from Ryder to podcaster how was it what you persuaded me if this was a lot easier than it was it you really did it was a total lie so it is a lot harder than I imagined to be a lot more fun than I imagined it to be and it was different and it was the eye care of conclusion that some stories are better told in this medium in a book form for me anyway I'm you have this great gift to be I said that you make time for this great gift of taking ideas and giving them the qualities of actions you don't actually even need a character all you need is your ideas to play with on the page in the people become almost incidental and that's it. But it's it and it's you create a feeling narrative even without the conventional ingredients of a narrative I can't do that when I ride what is essentially SAS material it reads like an essay if I don't have a main character if I don't have a drama them playing out and this this idea was it naturally kind of acid is it was a series of it's 70 pieces around a thing and it has a book I don't think it would have come here but so what other cool things I found was this the voice pause your voice is able to pull an audience through a story even if it's not exactly a story even if it's even if it's not as the materials not as unified as you would like it to be on the page I found it it's just it's interesting when they also you can hear the character's voices you know when you put something in quotation mark no matter what you do around it making that sound off the page you can't completely reproduce it we have characters who just come to life their voices just just bring them to do any work at all and so that was interesting to go back to dwell on that idea that there are certain ideas certain stories that you can only tell this way you know podcast what did you need to make sure the first diss explained with the podcast this cuz it's just came out yesterday in the first episode called against the rules and it's about referees in American Life and it is the general argument is that the human referee is on the run or under assault it went wherever you wherever you turn except in the cases where the rest been bought by one side then he might be very comfortably ensconced in a rigged system but the there wasn't for me there wasn't one story I wanted to tell their whole bunch of stories I want to tell and they would have felt in that in a book like either like a separate story or digression along the Russian I think and I wanted to play with the argument I don't want to play with the subject matter but I did not one person or I didn't have your normal what I have is either either main character who can teach the audience and I know I had separate characters here and it would have been hard to structure as a conventional narrative it's always interesting to be able to do it this way or the other big difference is book writing is really an individual sport I mean it is just it's just you and this is definitely it I don't know how you found it for me was completely a team sport it was and it was fabulous I mean the editor of the people who never tell who made the music the producers that you know they were all intimately involved in a couple of cases that produces when did a couple of the interviews and that was having to having a work with other people cuz he was healthy for me also having to cuz I don't often have to do it but having to satisfy them in the course of doing that was interesting normally of the satisfying me and they were hard to satisfy you know what they are hard to please and that was it that was just it was able to have that friction in my life did you feel like pleasing them entailed compromises so no meat learning what the hell I was doing I mean that they are you really did they were right and I was wrong well did my argument make sense to them. That's a simple one but much of it was just structural it was kind of like like what I see whether they had a better sense than I did I learned pretty quickly but about what someone who is just taking it in here would tolerate from the in the way of a way of digression in the way of unstructured story in the way of starting something and not coming back to it for 15 minutes what I had to do to accommodate to make sure that didn't lose the audience they also had a much better sense of what I could leave on the cutting-room floor that I all my scripts and it was it was more like was I reading a book that writing a screenplay. Which I've done it was kind of in between all the original scripts were twice as long as they needed to be and they are there was all stuff that I didn't see you could remove and they said they were really good at saying what you could pull out so this that was different just having a cup kind of collaboration but then you don't have to decide when I'm moving to the world looking for things I'm going to do some people catch my eye and I'll open a folder on it and it not knowing where it will. When is tax at manila folders beside and shelves beside my desk and a decade ago two things happens we're triggered this interesting referees and I never knew what I was going to do with in the folder got thicker and thicker but it never emerged as a narrative and then this medium comes along and I all of a sudden I could have no idea this was something along time in the do you remember what the initial trigger was for the interest in financial crisis and I was I just been put in charge of the Albany Berkeley girls softball league travel ball teams my job was to take these little girls from Berkeley the all stars from The League at age 8 10 12 and 14 and and get them into shape so they could go over the hill and then compete against Republicans and and my predecessor had not done a very good job of it and I went to acting seriously and so I might be my girls were playing and it the first time I right when I open the file if it starts with his it was our first tournament is a new place called Rohnert Park and it was a night game and they were a bunch of 9 year old girls on the field and maybe 50 parents in the stands it was closed and one of my girls slit in the home plate to tie the game the top of the last inning and the Rohnert Park the opposing team's coach came hair of the dog out and started started cursing up and down at the Umpire who called our little girl say I mean the language was just unbelievable and their whole fan sites are screaming at the Umpire and no one on our side none of the girls and I never heard the word fuck and they were they were they were watching this they never seem to love it cuz it was great I love that they could see how grown-ups actually behave instead of have it sent out Berkeley parents after they but but this thing escalated on the field and the coach didn't back down and the Umpire didn't back down the aisle pile was a woman and all of a sudden the Berkeley parents started getting rage and so you looked around and everybody screaming everybody mostly people screaming at the Umpire there was a great Berkeley moment when this voice cut through the night and she scares woman scream what horrible modeling for our children but beyond what it was like you idiot you asshole you and you know you're safe and the Umpire finally the coach fight through the coach out so you're out but it was his ballpark so he says okay you can throw me on the steps outside he says I am now no longer in the position of Coach are now in the position of director of this facility and you're fired so he phased out 9 at night in the malls are up in the in the lights and everybody else on the floor and then they just fired the only umpire so the game can't actually go on as she doesn't know what to do she actually just okay and just walks out of the parking lot there places standing on the field and I thought this is my moment when I'm spoiling the position of authority what what am I followed her out into the parking lot and she was weeping and I went up to her and I can put my arm around his before me to you know it okay to kind of in a bind like Manner and I and I said I said you know you know you don't you don't have to take that you really should go back and I said it was like is there anybody you can call and she says there's an Umpire Association and it was in California it was unbelievable there was anybody I was she gets the Empire Associates in the wind and they say he can't fire you we're going to call the guy who's the head of the thing that happened at a facility and we'll get him fired you go back and finish the umpiring and she went right back in and threw him out and and the game went on but from then on I started to watch these poor people who were brought out to umpire 9 year old girls games and they work on the on the receiving end of constant abuse at in my first question is why would anybody even do that job but my cigarettes was white why do people behave that way towards umpires I've never felt that way towards umpires why do they why do people take out so much of their fury on them why is that so hard that job so this happened as I finished the Big Short and I'm and I'm watching what's going on a Wall Street in the in the back end of the financial crisis and when we have look at natural crisis was it a No Parking problem that reffering problem there is there was a breakdown of several referee roast at the bit want to dig once was the credit rating agencies movies in standard form with refereeing the security of the Securities on that Wall Street brings the market now totally failed they totally fell for a very good simple reason they were being paid by the people who created the subprime mortgage bonds they were rating they were on the take one of the fires and this Empire briefly was played in public but basically was allowed to go right back to doing what they were doing without any reform whatsoever and so I had this umpiring filed with to Empire Tattoo Cozumel bars one was a very nice woman with some spine it was just trying to do her best and make sure the game was paid by Sara Lee and she was being made miserable and the other worthies umpires on Wall Street who who are doing their job and I kind of had a horrible incentives and and and we're not we're not agents of fairness and the society was enabling them to keep going even though they orchestrated helped orchestrate this horrible Calamity and I just started at that point I think you know I like why do some umpires why are some umpires in positions of strength and wires on Empire is in position weakness first thought when I was going to do is write a sitcom about a virus I just sat in the world or girls softball. I really no idea and I I just started accumulate material and then Jacob Weisberg your co-founder of Pushkin Industries and I are on a hiking trail the year and a half ago when we start talking about the subject so you know it could work as a podcast and by the time we saw when you start thinking about the subject and start looking we start looking for referees you see them everywhere there was an end up being 7 episode 15 and there was a kind of like there was some arguments to be teased out that you had to move around in a somewhat haphazard fashion that the podcast structure really let you do a second kind of writer Lee question in this file after that experience with your daughters how much did you like write a big how much did you write about the evening I wrote a paragraph about the evening and I put on the outside of it and taste it and I made notes to like I would check at the tournament of the girls tournaments I would follow the Empire back to scar they allow these guys live out of their cars and just talked to him a little bit about why they did what they did Amy and Sonic notes based on those conversations and I just I was just I just kind of shelf maybe that's a subject I will pursue but it just seems to me and then you might the more you watch it if you back away from and look at the way this Society treats people interested in sports in the umpiring it's bizarre you know you go to a basketball arena and 18000 people are chanting in unison ref you suck the the 18,000 people on the other side you are saying thank you for making the calls on my in our favor and it's like nobody's nobody's ever thinking this person for the cheating he supposedly doing on behalf of the other team of the other people seeing this person Injustice where it doesn't exist this person has his ability to generate an outrage that out of all proportion to like how he's behaving and he is at the center of a generally kind of unexplored end up on the cutting-room floor I interviewed Daryl Morey was the Houston Rockets GM who I adore who had lots and lots of studies about on fire at the referees new their Tendencies new like we're home court advantage was worse cuz the referees are better because referees more likely to give the home team to call I get all this work on referees and I asked him if he ever met him never met one of them no you don't never even occurred to me that I wish I could go meet one of these guys and talk to one of these guys if they were completely unexplored characters it's interesting to go back to the Paradigm you have between the Wall Street people and the baseball Little League Baseball umpires in one case the operating assumption is the I can influence direct if I try and intimidate her if I abused her in the other case the notion is that I simply buy them off that it was exaggerated and I'm always wondered why those roles are reversed so are there NBA coaches who try to charm referees and are there businesses who who or businesspeople who explicitly Triad essentially scream at the government referee so the answer the first question is surprisingly few the NBA players that you can't really get the players even the former players won't talk about the rest of the day just get in trouble but Shane Battier who's a friend who played in the NBA for many years has said to me it amazed him that no one ever how seldom people try to actually be nice to the rest and that's what it be his strategy was to be nice the rest we thought that was an original strategy b b b b but the answer the answer the NBA is one of the reasons everybody's really even angrier the rest even though the rest are getting better is that the rats are getting better their heart is hard to charm and harder to impossible to intimidate they're holding themselves it is objective standards and they're judged by these objective standards and the stuff that's going on around there more and more impervious to the second part is it are there do so I think the browbeating works in private but it's so much better if you can just buy the RAF you know I mean it if you if you look at it if you look at the way that mean the rate it that that was not such a sweet Robin to go in and scream at Moody's and standard bore that you're subprime-mortgage Bonds in Triple A so much better just to slip them some money to make note to create that sent it so that there are more likely to smile upon the the Securities but so anyway it's an interesting that the more interesting to me and it became more real in the presidential election because because the the two campaigns that had a real energy about them is Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump's campaign and the bottom campaigns was the system's rigged that they was all about referees having not done their job and there was some justice to those charges but that and that's why I thought you know maybe we could maybe there's maybe this is worth trying to do and it was we'll have more of my conversation with Malcolm Gladwell at the 92nd Street Y in New York after this break here's a podcast from Pushkin industries that I think you might like you might think you know what it takes to lead a happier life more money a better job or Instagram worthy vacations you're dead wrong Yale Professor dr. Laurie Santos has studied the science of happiness and found that many of us do the exact opposite of what will truly make our lives better based on the psychology course she teaches it yeah it's the most popular class in the University's three hundred year history Lori will take you through the latest scientific research and she doesn't through Stories the change the way you think about happiness this season to guess include US Army vet and actor J R Martinez figure skating Champion Michelle Kwan and legendary swimming coach Bob Bowman you can find a happiness lab starting September 17th on Apple podcast Spotify or wherever you like to listen we're now back with more of my conversation with Malcolm Gladwell I wanted to compare notes with Malcolm who's been podcasting for a while if you listen closely you'll hear a little bit about what's to come in the next season of his show revisionist history when you when you made those initial observations about umpires rephrase did you think you were examining an age-old problem or a new problem the things I loved about the first episode that came out yesterday was I kept on I was thinking of this is interesting and Michael's going to tell me why we've always had this problem but then you told me no no no no this is new for really really interesting reasons and that was a turn where you cook me in and then that was an obvious turn I feel like if I would have blown it because I was just trying to prove to you to be around forever and that's not interesting that the refs have been abused forever you know what you're observing is something the Romans did you know that I would have done that some Ludacris Move like that but the thing I was genuinely so that prize by the turn where we learn its new and why why it's new sports is such a wonderful laboratory just couldn't so clean and so many ways but it's new and it's it's it's it's new-ish in that the NBA Adam Silver became commissioner the first episode is about the rest of us Sports the only episode in the series it's about sports is the first is the first episode and it's about it professional basketball refs and which it was interesting to me about that subject is if you remember just just chatted generally true Sports combination of technology and Anna where at and transparency is forcing all the Umpire and referee to get better and you would think that would cause everybody to appreciate the rest more or at least protest them less but that's not happening basketball score from the point of view of the rest is getting worse and worse or like more likely to need a bodyguard to the arena more likely to have really ugly thing said in the stand out of the stand more likely to have to throw star players out of the gate because of things they do in Sac at the same time the rest of the rat in the referee is clearly more objectively accurate and the thing do you remember Curt Schilling the picture so this way there was a moment we told you what kind of why objective refereeing might end up creating a lot of anger in sports Major League Baseball introduced pitch track machines into a ball a ball parks and that's the machine that shows you where the strike zone is and up to the point they introduce these machines the strike zone is entirely the subject matter with the Empire thinks it's a stripe and there's no real way to check him now they have measure the strike zone they can determine if the Empire has been after the fact that the Empire has been calling accurately or not and he has graded on his accuracy is measured Against the Machine so there's been a decade since they've introduced those machine is been in pressure on these umpires to conform to the steps of the machines accuracy and the end and they have and they'll brag I only got one wrong you know now why they even keep you up there is another question cuz the machine could just do it but the umpires started to change the way they call the game in response to the machine meaning they became more accurate you think everybody would think that was a good thing for chilling came out of the Ballgame early when he's picture I can remember who's pitching for the time when the Red Sox win the Diamondbacks Furious because it's before he did not perform well went into the Dugout grabbed a bat and went and destroyed the pitch track machine and if they find him $50,000 and he and he was angry because the Umpire used to give him calls that were not strikes before they introduced this machine and he no longer was given that privileged you no longer had the advantage is there naturally accorded the stars and something like that is what's going on in basketball and what's happening basketball is its name in try to introduce your spirit of objectivity and they've done it many different ways they have they built this five years ago if the 15 million dollars they built this replay Center in Secaucus New Jersey which is the site of the first episode of the podcast 15 million dollars to to run direct fiber optic cables to to every basketball NBA basketball in the each arena there I don't know a dozen cameras anyway try to get every angle on the court and this room in Secaucus is a hundred and ten television screens showing them all the angles on every Court in the NBA and that's all it shows is so you can't watch you know you can't watch Homeland on it you can't you can't do anything with these TVs accept watch whatever happens to walk on to that basketball court wherever it is and their gods their professional referees in there every night during the season double-checking the calls of the actual rest on the floor in case the rest make mistakes and the wrestling cells are not graded and they're showing their mistakes after the game if the opportunity to check their mistakes and their rights they're trained and evaluated all kinds of ways they never been before they are the hiring process is more professional it's just like gotten used to be an old boys network like half a dozen the rest 25 years ago given the same high school it was just a bunch of kind of chubby white guys mainly Catholic and now you got talent search they got to get in shape they speak fat right everybody else in America is getting fatter in the wrestler get in better shape now they're buff and the end and they're trained they talked about all their biases the kind of biases the kind of into brisky taught us about but also you know that they're more likely to give the home team to call or they have racial bias and it's hot and it's not the correct for all this stuff how could it be anything but better but getting better does not mean making is not making people happy. It's in flaming that it's it's partly in flaming the situation then I mean is there such word as the world's change the problem is now the fans can not only see in real time that a mistake might have been made they can see for sure on the jump in a mistake was made for might have been made and they can then and they can capture on their phones and they can't read it and they they they have a they have material for outrage and if the largest and the players and so the the sense of grievance even though the reason for grievance is clearly the client the reasons for declining the feelings Agreements are going through the roof so it's becoming more fair on a basketball court that people feel it's less Fair yeah but I don't think you could fix it by making the referees even worse than they are used to be you know remember the phrase that was common in basketball the makeup call yeah that's you know you made a mistake if you know you made a mistake then don't make it about other everybody and then so the reason that you don't get quite as outraged as you have talked about in the past the old system do you know you think that it is you think you know the reference of human being and you say oh you'll understand that he blew that call and he'll make it up for me in some subtle way and that will so that diminishes my sense of outrage in a perfect world where these guys are like robots and making the right witcha General recently are there it's amazing how good they are there so when J on those rare occasions when they do make a mistake there's no expectation of a makeup call know that's right so is that mean there are Mei cuz I wonder about the I agree with you you can never go back but I feel like when you serve Robata size refereeing in sports what you've done is disrupted The Narrative of the sport that you drawn to the sports because it's a story and stories it used to be that the blown calls were part of the narrative that good part of the narrative sure they're part of like what makes the game just went smoothly from beginning to end you don't want referee era it's not a positive thing to have referee era it's you want to minimize if you can still have a glorious narrative Auto ins in in any kind of pocket without a reference that better no no I'm saying that we operate for many years around a narrative about sports that included the notion of referee are we've taken that out and what we've done is we've disrupted The Narrative maybe we're just going through a period of time we were really I think that's true that starts partly true and if it's awesome I need to know if there's a whole bunch of things going on at once one is that everybody can see the arrow and replay it and focus on it and organized around anyways they they they couldn't before another is that the nature of the Improvement the refereeing is its removing privilege from people who can naturally protests the loudest the stars and and they used to get in the calls and then I can't they can't get the calls in the same way it's all so you know there was if you go back 10 years in the NBA home court advantage was a much bigger deal and it was and there were studies that were done to the source of home court event was referee era was like the referees find a tilt towards the home crowd just to appease them now it's not that big a deal but who's pissed about that the people who were in The Arena of the people who think they should get an advantage because it's their own court against a bit even bigger than all this is people are more more aware or have a greater greater sense that there's no such thing as neutrality that there is people are biased you know that there are no less by your left even though there and they are they've been made aware of their biases Every Which Way and try to work against them every but it's in the air that a white guy won't be fair is fair to a black guy is his to a white guys in the air that that the continents were ski stuff that people make those kind of mistakes it's in the air that they are they favor the home country where they favor Stars so visit even as there's one less reason for cynicism about what's going on inside the mind of a professional NBA referee is more awareness awareness of the reasons for citizens of a lot of people judgment referee judgment generally that want to take away is from the convent of Mercy stop is it nobody's like nobody's judgments everybody's judgment is systematically for what's interesting is the yes it is the process of investigating what the process of investigating bias does is alert us to the uncomfortable fact that there was a lot of bias there that we didn't even think about that's right we had no idea just how unfair it all used to be set reminder yesterday I was for one of my podcast episodes I'm hanging out with the folks who make the LSAT to construct the outside and they do these biased tests so they have practice questions with you all take when you take the LSAT has one set the cell practice questions and they look to see whether different groups have different patterns of answering questions correctly question about some literary figure in the 17 century and see which is the wrong answer all the smartest women taking the test that was the correct answer like 50% of them. It said it was saying it wasn't the right answer was overwhelmingly the mail Choice 50% of the bed so here's a question that has this patterns in the air in the air is just a massive pattern in the air and it's nothing obviously. And if they find the pattern they are. I think there's something wrong with the question what is it about this totally Anodyne question about 17th century literature that caused all these really smart female test-takers to answer seat and there was no clue it just doesn't work that process the minute I hear that I think oh my God this thing is rigged in ways I hadn't even thought you know you and I both made this turn into this new medium your feet of yours out of me how have you found what are you find the differences are from writing this Pros on the page well I've gone to the opposite because I don't write books that are character-driven as much now a medium I'm really into the character driven so I like I'm drawn to the fact that I can bring these characters to life in a way because I'm not an awesome artist I'm not nearly as good as you at bringing individual's life on the page but if I can get tape then I can do that I feel like you can capture interactions that doesn't one of my episodes this season I have these two women who is sisters who wrote a book together a really good book of History largely so they can hang out with each other this one's been one is 65 and they're so insanely charming and all you do is just run the tape and you're in love with it or love it if it doesn't matter what happens next it is like it is amazing the difference when you can hear persons what's we have an episode at the second episode with you actually edited it's about how hard it is to create a referee even when you clearly need a referee in this if it's about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau we have a woman who is who is just Crush by student while I got that will make it to the point where she she she is a public school teacher who was with a couple of kids who who student loan servicer is basically to see if you're from shouldn't even knowing really about four years knowing about a program that Congress created to relieve her student loan debt because of a them keep her in the student in the in the debt and to the point where her she grind as been grinding your teeth so badly night at 5 her teeth falling out she's now won't smile and if if I told the story just if I just told the story you might think I had my thumb on the scale you wouldn't quite believe it like you think I was going to add you rating but when she just tells it straight your weeping and then there's no question the sincerity just just it just jumps out of the off off the take it away in a way that I would have to try to persuade the reader up and I don't you just let her speak and it's magnificent incredibly moving what can't you do in the podcast that story did you whether there must be limitations do things you don't have tape up that's the that's the problem you got to go out and interview give to have the thing if it's you just talkin it's far less less persuasive than if you got some someone else you know it's it's so that it's it's a constraint that's worse with TV when you have to have that the pictures but you can only do so much with your own words in this in the narrative form I think that's your constrain there but we can't you do I put stories week it's complicated it gets hard I could not so it's heart was very hard to explain I didn't even really explain but I tried to explain a collateralized debt obligation in The Big Short most complicated thing I've ever tried to explain to anybody and you could not do it in the podcast that you just you just couldn't I mean people would have Collision that people listen to their driving would be having crashes on the highway and you you you so because the the reader can go back I really can't slow down the reader can taste themselves through an explanation my heart is where you finally find the person who you think can explain this thing is going to give you tape and then you're boring in the book it doesn't matter write in a book like I feel like watching that is clearly in your life so I can put it in our way so I put it a different way you're absolutely right that that people's voices kill them as characters you're you're you're talking to them five minutes and you think that boys just won't works out like it's not going to work and you know it yet there are people in this world who it's almost as a superpower you have an ability to walk into a room and kill all interest in the room I mean I had an uncle who had this capacity and it was he was a great guy and he did really interesting stuff but the minute he opened his mouth it was like it was like everybody's gasping for air there's no Oxygen in them and you just incredibly don't and it was Dulles listening to him and you just relieved when he someone else just threw themselves on the hand grenade and any DMV so it is true that you can take that person in print and bring them to life I can make my uncle really great in Arabic but but I could not the minute the minute someone heard him speak you lose they wouldn't believe sometimes you think someone is going to be boring but it's cause you're in book interview mode and podcast interview different than what you really want to do when you're dating someone on a podcast if you want them to speculate and free associate so you went to push them you don't want them getting when you drink when you doing the book interview you want to describe in detail you know A to Z how this works you never say what you say is about imagine this and then they realized oh it's Play It's play right now that's really true that's really true had to swim to the love I just interviewed for this one of my pockets with this guy who was at OBGYN researcher in Philadelphia and he gets his In The Weeds on some new character chapter deep in the woods and Phil follicles and then he should have said something about why is that a contraceptive it was really interesting totally hypothetical thing about this is absolutely right and we had an episode 3 is about rafts in in the culture like language rest people who people who who are usage panel members in dictionaries who let go and I was talking to Brian Garner who's the character in the episode and he's he's the author of a book called Garner's Modern English usage I think that's what's called a hundred Pages it's actually riveting but nobody but at Barnes & Noble told him a decade ago as a default category as Heroes their books sold millions of copies there were times where it was a time when the win the language ref talk about a bigger role that he doesn't now the crowd refs the language in it and and nobody wants to hear from the snoot but he's a great guy and he was just talking about like where the culture has gone and how he's daily outraged by things that you just can't believe that we're we're we're becoming this and he said I got a letter from my back it said dear mr. Garner semicolon and he was off for bikes like the like for like 10 minutes on on I call my bank manager I said there's a mistake it says Dear mr. Garner semicolon and any since it's either a colon or, and the bank manager said could you write us a letter about that and he said so I wrote them a letter and I just wrote I said I wrote them a letter and I cited all the authorities including Garner's Modern English usage about where they don't put a semicolon after dear mr. Garner and they they they wrote him back and said we're keeping the semicolon and he called me since this is an outrage and he's Bram it's genocide is a code red it isn't this a certain quality of delight that we're talking about it only gets conversation from the lights you don't get it's really hard to get the light off the page you get to light when you're in a conversation with someone and they go on some in some unexpected direction and you sort of understand something else is coming down the pike going to waiting for it and then take on that's what you're a little bit in the direction of going off to see what happens and the good ones will I understand if they've been given lycidas play a game with you stay with us for some more conversational Delight with Malcolm Gladwell we're back with more of me and Malcolm Gladwell in conversation at the 92nd Street y his new company Pushkin Industries is the production house behind against the rules and I couldn't help but he's a little bit about something the crew there told me it's funny at the producers when they came to me in the first place they said please please don't be like Malcolm and and try to take your own stuff the first season almost at Malcolm's podcast almost kill this nonsense you know they are out there a sound and they study their scripture and then they go to The Cloisters and they take about silence and then they listen to pure audio you know in the evenings like that's not the real world I'm living it I'm not I'm not in the monastery so I don't listen to him and it'll listen to you with questions oh I was taught you about falling in love it's sweet of your books you fall in love with characters and then you were saying that in the podcast you're doing a different kind of different story telling what your having many voices are you or are we going to get the classic Michael Lewis character who we fall in love along with you and if we're not does that sort of a little bit sad about not having people to follow if you have people to fall in love with this just they're up there there in a single episode I just don't live with them for the whole series I thought 11 Alex kogan Alex kogan is he was the the academic responsible for the work that supposedly allowed Cambridge analytica to get Donald Trump elected and in fact it's all bulshit his work was useless the real story there is that it's amazing at Cambridge analytica persuaded anybody they knew anything that was useful hustle it's a hustle it's a yes and I love you wanted to believe that that's why Donald Trump has lied because they needed a reason why don't this is actually part of episode three largest decline of these culture wrestling it so it's it's language refs it's Ombudsman it's referees in The Newsroom show how the story ever got to the front page of the New York Times is is is part of it but he's built up is the main character of the thing and in a very similar way to a character that you would fall in love with it in a magazine piece so in some ways it's it's as it's easier to sell the characters because you can hear them you can see why you you should fall in love with him people hear you can't really see it I bet I want to hear no Ken Feinberg is hemp fiber should be a household name Ken Feinberg was a lawyer when he was brought in in the early 80s to try to resolve the dispute between Vietnam veterans and the chemical companies that made Agent Orange in Vietnam veteran without a whole lot of evidence that brought us she's saying that this this chemical that was sprayed across the jungles of Vietnam was responsible for all these health problems they were having and the case had lingered in the courts for seven or eight years and judges in Despair and resolve again and a judge ask this young lawyer Ken Feinberg to see if he could negotiate outside of the Court solution resolution to the between the Mets and the companies in 6 weeks everything done news on the front page of every newspaper in the country and his career than just went all of a sudden you became America's referee so he's he's brought in to adjudicate these disputes and the question was like to question like what are we going to do when he dies because he seems to be brought any Emmys like these like the Forrest Gump and 10 seconds like what what what is about a white and I don't want to give away the story but he did their work he had a theory of himself and his wife had a different theory of him and the wife's was right but his wife's Theory you can hear kind of proven just in the sound of his voice voice so it's so good that I think it's all the boys so it's so it's so you couldn't even though it's price it's the righteousness in the voice it's not and it's a Boston accent like you cannot believe episode opens with the passage in the Bible Solomon resolving the dispute between the two women each of them is claiming the baby is hers Solomon just about to cut the baby into and fibrous voice is so we were having actor read that we had the fiber Voice or so we just had fine but read the Bible and it was what you felt like God was reading the Bible Forum it's just nice to have a different way to tell a story in a different way to get to an audience I don't I don't regard this is like a substitute for writing books but at least it's different in the difference then when you ride it no matter how conversational your writing style is it is not conversation it's how people talk is so different from how any writer writes that you have to learn how to write your your own dial that's so interesting anyway thanks for doing this Michael thank you for being with you again thanks for listening to this live bonus episode of against the rules I want to thank especially Malcolm Gladwell and his team Pushkin Industries and the 92nd Street y for hosting our conversation I'm off now to my secret hiding place we'll try to figure out how to keep you entertained next year you can follow Pushkin pods on social media if you want to keep track of when I'm back on the feet I hope it's soon I don't know each and every one of you but you've been a great audience the best a writer could ask for
