I don't have a direct number for nor of course so I don't know about to call her the talking about me but anyway if you could hello hello I'm Nora McInerny and this is terrible thanks for asking hello every one of our interviews for the show starts the same way with us trying to make sure that we can hear each other hello hello one of my favorite things to do is to listen to other people's love stories I love hearing about people's husbands wives Partners girlfriends boyfriends. I love to know about the person you love hangover hi hello can you hear me I can hear you great if I just don't like hearing myself oh yeah yeah we have we have an echo as well so when we finally did connect I ask Barbara about her husband Maynard he was over six feet is Big bummed but he like to work out so I had a lot of muscle and he wore his hair in a crew cut and everybody is always asking him if he was military it he looked intimidating but then as soon as he smiled you knew how it would have Barry was what a teddy bear you know how long the desert sportscasting for football yes everybody always said he look just like him Barbara that's exactly who I was imagining really is exactly what I was imagining wow you're going to describing I'm good at imagining good team here play some how he was and he said if I were any better I'd have to be twins and they talked about his laugh when he started laughing the entire room with shut up and just listen and then start laughing you just because such an amazing man he was the type of person who would when you were talking to him he made you feel like you're the only person in the world and he did that to everybody and then his job he was a safety engineer and he could put on a suit and meet in the boardroom with the bigwigs before project or he could go down on the construction site with his cowboy boots and jeans on and talk to the labor and make them all feel the same way and I know he was he was extraordinary Barbara and Maynard I love Maynard just hearing his description but I fell more in love with their love the more that Barbara talked they had that kind of relationship where you just want to be around the other person all the time or even regular boring stuff is somehow wonderful because you're doing it together he traveled a lot but when he traveled close enough where he could drive I always went with him and I would always read to him but we get the newspaper and I'd reach him I don't read headline you don't hear this okay and I'd read it and yeah I love that it was great Maynard and Barbara lived in the suburbs of Atlanta we're building a new house together near one of Maynard's favorite golf courses they were in their early 40s gearing up for the rest of their lives together a really good life together Maynard traveled a lot for work but the two of them had a routine to keep them connected even when he was on the road Barbara would help Maynard pack his bags and plan his outfits for every trip and when he left I always knew where Maynard was what he was doing when he kept in constant we had a Lifeline he would call me when he got to the airport he'll call me when he landed he would call me when he got to his hotel Maynard was a safety engineer for Marsh & McLennan it's a big company he was so proud to work there and he just gotten a promotion his next trip was to New York City to meet his new bosses do business guy stuff conference rooms handshakes acronyms Barbara had been planning to go along because City but the trip had been condensed to just two days so Maynard went on his own I remember helping him pack and telling him you have to take a jacket I'm sure you'll go out to dinner you're in New York City you have to have a jacket so I knew what he was wearing each day and yeah it was just it was meetings so get there early get through the meetings get to the airport and get home to you that's right we were looking forward to our future we knew what we wanted to do after we were tired we wanted to go up to the North Carolina mountains and we wanted to run a bed-and-breakfast up there yeah I guess like everybody just living day by day doing what we needed to do Kenda and living for a future which was the old saying you know if you want to make God laugh tell him tell him your plans that's specifically why don't tell him my plans got it don't tell God anything she'll just ruin it for you lock it all the way in your diary and don't give her even a hint of what you're hoping for anyways Maynard called his bride from the airport he called when he landed he called when he got to the hotel before heading over to the World Trade Center to work Clash of Clans home office was in the North Tower and he was on the hardwood floor and he called when he was looking out the window is about 4 in the afternoon he says how you should see this view it's amazing it's absolutely amazing he is like a little kid in so many ways the date was September 10th that night Maynard went to his hotel called Barbara and I knew what his plans were the next morning he knew he had to get up early and be at the office because instead of going out to breakfast they were going to have a meeting for breakfast and so we had to be in the office about 8 and cyanide I feel good I knew that the last words I ever said I love you and that's the last words I heard from him anyone who is old enough to be conscious of the world around them knows where they were on 9/11 they know where they were when they first heard about what was happening I was in bed hungover in my freshman dorm room my roommate had turned on the TV and I yelled at her because we had the day off and I apologize for that Sarah Sparks our producer Hans was in the first class of a new semester and his teacher got a call and then hung up and kept teaching Marcel was in fourth grade in a brand new school he is in class he thinks that the teacher pulled in a TV and they watched it together Hannah meacock Ross was in Colorado so perfect day at the bright blue sky just with some of her friends from New York and one of their dads worked in the towers he was freaking out there fighter jets flying overhead for the run on gas stations I was in the master bedroom making the bed and I have the TV on I was watching Good Morning America inside of talking he said something about a plane hitting the building hitting the Trade Towers that's all I heard I've never been to New York and I really didn't know what the Trade Towers were either course the two twin Trade Center buildings that are down at the foot of Manhattan that they really are the beacons of New York it was there that there was the explosion a couple of years ago I brought about by Terrace with that's all gone through the courts but this we don't know anything about we don't know about anything that has happened here other than the fact that there's obviously been a major incident there and we're going to go to a special report now from ABC News and I imagine nothing but like a lot of people do to get to make a 6 seater Cessna or something you know running into the building and I looked at the TV and they showed the North Tower and they show black smoke coming out of the building and it was a fire in a very very large building and I didn't write I picked up the phone when I called Maynard and of course the phone went straight to voicemail so honey I said I'm watching TV I thought y'all have a fire in your building and they are just give me a call let me know everything's okay a few minutes most of the world didn't understand what had just happened what it meant that an airliner had crashed into the 99th floor of the North Tower 13 minutes later the second plane came and crashed into the second building it didn't quite take on the severity of the time yeah it was it was confusion there was a lot of confusion trying to understand what was happening and try to understand what was going on we all remember where we were on 9/11 but most of us did not have a family member there most of us did not have a husband there the Barbara dead and she stayed calm and Dad what you do when things are scary and crazy she called her best friends Lisa and Daphne who live in Tampa it's funny cuz I knew any other schedules and I knew one would be driving to work and I didn't want to tell her this while she was driving and I called the other day I called Daphne and I think I said something about canopy see what's going on she said yes and I said Maynard's there that's her Maynard is she hung up on most immediately called Lisa and within hours and they jumped in the car and came up to Atlanta and stayed with me we were just we were so clueless we did not know what was going on the last thing that went through my head was that mean you're cuz Dad there was there was it just didn't occur to me I thought he got out when they show pictures of people running across the bridge I kept looking at all these people knew what he was wearing I knew that he had on a white shirt and blue pants blue trousers and I kept looking for him there are things that are just too much for your brain to take in things that are just too much to process and for Barbara the possibility that Maynard was dead was not an option her brain could give her Maynard wasn't dead was just missing Barbara and Daphne and Lisa spend days like this watching TV waiting for the phone to ring lost in the magical thought that Maynard is out there somewhere we'll be right back I'm as obsessed as anyone else with making healthy habits I sleep 8 hours a night I write in a journal I take my ritual vitamins every night with a

for the attack to become a formative point in US politics but all of that it wasn't relevant to Barbara I didn't want to know I didn't want to know anything I didn't care all I cared about was my husband I didn't care this was a terrorist attack guy in the sounds horrible but I didn't care I didn't care about Dunlawton I didn't care about the hijackers I just didn't care I don't know what it's like to look at this happening and seeing a terrorist attack same as these people attacking America I could never see that all I could say was something's happening to my husband 10 time it was just what we did this for all I want to say waking up a lot is so fuzzy at that time so I'm not sure of exact days but I feel like it's like a week and a half Lisa and Daphne wrap their love around Barbara while they wait while days slide into one another and details of the attack emerge and will Maynard continues to not call but eventually the magical thinking wears off I knew if he was alive I would have heard from him by now you know there was just no way that he would let me go that long without hearing from him it becomes apparent that Maynard is not lying in hospital bed stricken by amnesia that the last phone call she shared with him would be the last phone call she shared with him ever the Maynard is one of the 2977 people who were murdered on September 11th 2001 typically when someone dies you know it or someone knows that you're there or someone else is there you're notified you see the body you pick out clothes for them to be cremated or buried in whatever your culture or faith calls for Barbara doesn't get any of that she gets a lot of ambiguity I don't believe anybody ever specifically told me but he was dead not having a a body was was fine with me I'm a big believer that we have a soul and our bodies are just carriers of we are not our bodies but there was so much going on there was so many died already begun receiving letters from State officials in New York and of course there are no bodies so you know the government took over the government decided they changed all these rules for us they decided they were going to immediately start freaking out death certificates for these people but we had to get proof I had to approve from his business idea proof from the airline and I had to get proof from his hotel and send all that and Tyga get a death certificate from him the good thing about paperwork is that keeps you busy gives your body something to do your brain something to focus on it keeps you moving I think I I think I was a robot another time I just did what I had to do I would I have a file that must be 12 in sick of the paperwork involved it was just everybody's coming at you they're trying to help the trying to do with that can but I am I able to just live with constant I remember sitting at my desk for hours and hours every day doing paperwork which is probably a good thing you busy and then there were the everything else that it was the outer line verifications of this event that started trickling in they start talking about war and they start back talking about suits and they started talking about this and that and maybe you know when you're involved in any lawsuits brought on by the federal government if you're involved if you get every single piece of paper copy of everything that goes to the courts all of the families from 9/11 had to do this paperwork but Barbara is the only person she knows waiting through the grief of losing a husband and the chaos of losing him in a terrorist attack and the piles of paperwork that are arriving 911 continues to dominate the news it's everywhere on magazine covers in newspaper headlines it's on the news it's on the TV all the time Barbara it's not news it's not about terrorism or patriotism it was just it was a horrible event that happened where my husband was killed at the end there was something about Mary was murdered he was murdered I came as a shock and I even think about that when people say oh he died on 9/11 he was killed on 9/11 911 sometimes feels like it belongs to New York but people from all over the country died and it feels like it belongs to America but people from all over the world died or the 90 countries lost citizens in the attack accountant New York City in 2001 all refer to New York is feeling we homie and kind and connected like is a galvanizing event for the residents of that City in New York survivors of the dead and survivors of that day can commune that can be there in form support groups are held up its Heroes by the media they're given the eyes of the world but I envy the people New York because they weren't they had each other and they were looked at differently and they weren't they were they were helped so much did you have a way to connect with other 9/11 widows after all of this not at all not at all I wish I wish I had I remember I think I was Diane Sawyer did a year after 9/11 she did a show and went and spoke with a bunch of 9/11 widows in New York City of course and New York and New Jersey and I remember just glued to the TV and I'm looking at these women and I just hung on every word they have to say and Diane Sawyer would walk through some of their houses and I want to know are the clothes still in the closet do you do still have his things are there pictures on the walls are you still wearing your wedding ring I'm looking I'm just observing all these these things wanting to know Am I Wrong do I take my wedding ring off to put it on my other finger when do I stop wearing it going black do I donate his clothes and Suburban Georgia Barbara is either at the only 911 Widow in town or at least the only 9/11 widow she knows it's 2001 there won't be Facebook for years let alone Facebook groups there's a Twitter or Instagram there was nothing that I couldn't I could grab onto to tell me to get me through this and then that was one of the times I envy the people in New York City and I felt I felt very alone the worst thing was the silence I used to drive me crazy and I I v I got to feeling bad so bad to mention to people that I lost my husband on 911 because I would get so upset so I stopped mentioning it in fact I even started lying to people about how my husband died I was having dinner with my friend Lisa and her husband and we were sitting in a bar and a couple came inside catty-corner to us and I believe it's our anniversary but they were young and you were talking about marriage and the girl looked at me and she says you know are you married and said no I'm widowed and limos who so how did your husband die and I knew if I said on 9/11 in the World Trade Towers it would just kill the whole evening so I said he was killed in a plane crash and that's that's my usual go to answer to a lot of people it's sad it's horrible but then conversation went on again so Barbara learns how to keep Maynard's death close to her to disclose that sparingly to people who can handle it that is its own kind of loneliness time rolls on the pile of paperwork grows Barbara holds a memorial for Maynard even without his body show the place in her heart for Him remember at the memorial thinking to myself that I wanted to be Jackie O I wanted to get a walkthrough and everybody thinks she's so strong but now I'm bawling my eyes out doing the ugly cry I believe it I walked around a very very deep hole in myself I knowing he he was done knowing he was gone and I would never see him again is painless into a turbo if I remember going with his boss and one of his co-workers we went out to lunch one day and I cannot control myself iibk sitting there in the restaurant I started crying and I just I couldn't stop the pain was so intense it's I I'm never felt pain within my life just that the the pain of knowing I would never ever say this man again it hurt it hurt and then one day Barber gets a notification from the New York police they found something he didn't carry wallet he carried like this portfolio you and I imagine it was sitting on the conference table when the plane hit and I understood you know the force when the plane hit things went flying out if you don't think I'm paperwork all the way to Brooklyn I think I have no idea how far away that is from Manhattan but they found in really great condition his passport is driver's license and credit cards photos they found a little love note I always used to ride him love notes and permanent suitcase and stuff what did the note say so it would just said you know hi sweetheart I'm thinking of you have a great day and I love Babs but there's not just me nerd stuff the city of New York has an entire forensics team the largest in the world that's dedicated to processing and identifying over 22,000 human remains from those victims Barbara's friend Daphne volunteered to be the contact for the medical examiner in New York to be the person that they would call when they found Maynard April 2002 they called and they asked her do you want to know what it is and she would take care of it all then she would call me and say you know they've got something I didn't want to know what anything was like I didn't want to know okay fine it was a piece of him the medical examiner in New York cremated remains and sent it down to Atlanta to a local Funeral Parlor I have never seen an entire body that was cremated before I didn't know how much ashes then it creates so I went to the Harlan this is box and there's back inside and I pull out the baggie and it's like this little dime-sized I'm a child of the 70s like yeah we smoke pot so I'm looking at this pic like it's got to like a little dime size of a pot and it's got this don't get a couple inches across the bottom and I'm looking at it and I'm thinking out I thought there would be more but it's just it's this tiny little liar and I didn't know anything about it I didn't want to know anything about it and she didn't accept that it was a part of Maynard come home it was real she could touch something I just paperwork and memories what part of a body should have another part of a goodbye I knew he wanted to be cremated we had talked about that we both did he and he wanted his ashes thrown over the mountains of North Carolina he said Carolina was God's country Barbara and a friend drive to North Carolina to stop at a Lookout Point they get out of the car we went over there and get the ashes and just started throwing them off the mountain side not thinking about wind wind and Ashes and all the ashes started flying back to us and my girlfriend always mad at other times she know she knew Maynard. She was like sleep with me when I first met miners and we started cracking up laughing all these ashes are flying back in and it's in her mouth it's in her face and her hair there was this man and this little boy that stopped in the same overpass and they came over and we looked over there more laughing and I think my friend said something like a what were just trying to get rid of her husband which made us laugh even more and we honestly we thought you know this man is looking at this right now he is just dying laughing and then we get we get back in the car and there's there's ashes under a nails and everything and I looked and I started licking my fingers didn't you say this in your Ted talk to I did that to you yeah yeah yeah I did I started licking my fingers and there was something I actually had some rather satisfying about that to me like now he's in yourself I don't know how biology works but I believe it he's just forever it was February of 2005 I think it was they called Daphne and they said we have another piece and same same situation and I going to pick it up but I pull out the baggie this time and it's when it like one of these large freezer baggies and it's almost full I'd like a good Lord III again this was just this was outrageous I have no idea what this is to me that would that be I thought maybe that was whole body I don't know what it was to the study. Know what it was I found out by accident the first piece they sent me was a piece of bone this piece I don't know maybe like a whole torso or something I don't know but I did the same thing this time just by myself I wrote up to North Carolina there was a bed and breakfast that made her night stayed at and I asked them if they would mind if I don't pay no taxes and in their back is a little river back there and I was just such a beautiful spot so I dumped his ashes back there and then in 2008 they have more because they have a they have a facility set up where they learn more and more about DNA as time goes on and the system that they use its more and more advanced they still have tens of thousands of pieces of body parts from 9-11 still and they're constantly working I'm checking these pieces and as soon as the DNA testing advances they go back and they recheck everything so it's quite possible I could still get more but at this third time I said I can't like no I said I can't do this anymore I said this is just that it's too weird getting my my husband back in pieces and I don't want to do this we'll be right back everyone needs therapy that's a personal opinion but I'm right

in Atlanta far away from New York as time goes on farther and farther away from 2001 not any farther from Maynard the legacy of his death the paperwork lasted four years things lasted four years trials lasted for years that never quit every death has an anniversary but not every death is a national day of mourning not every death of versuri is televised or memorialized becomes a recurring social media meme that Maynard says that might be comforting for so many people it isn't for Barbara instead every September she finds herself crawling into a little hole no TV no phone no Internet can't wait to see anyting to this day I still avoid the anniversaries there's one image in particular which everybody still likes to use and I sometimes I see it in the strangest places the last places in the world I would imagine it's the North Tower with the black smoke come out end it to me that's exactly where my husband was and he was burning up in that in that smoke and I have this reaction like I can't whenever I see it I just it's it's almost like I feel like I'm being stabbed and I feel this pain inside and it it die sometimes I even I even let out this mild Scream It's sex me in such a way such a physical way when I see that every time and that's another thing that that that bothers me I tell people I said it's like as I say your your partner was killed in a car crash and they keep showing you the car crash over and over and over again and you keep watching you keep watching your partner being killed in this car crash so that's what it's like when I see you at the building with a smoke or the buildings coming down I said it's it's it's like looking at that over and over and over again it's been 18 years since Barbara heard Maynard's voice said she wrote him that note that was sent back to her love Babs time does not heal all wounds that's just something people like to stitch on pillows and calligraphy on Instagram time is irrelevant to this kind of pain or this kind of love Barbara could still fall in love again but there will only ever be one Maynard there was Maynard there was reading him newspaper headlines as he drove along the highway I'm sitting up in bed with him exchanging notes on work projects there are inside jokes and love notes tucked into books and briefcases there were millions of little moments over thousands of days they spent together not just that one day that he died I don't need a specific day I get no I still I am still so immensely in love with this man and I dated one man for three years and I did love him I was in love with him but I I remember we were living together and I remember one day standing in the kitchen I was looking at the window and I was thinking about Maynard and I was thinking if Maynard came knocking on the door right now I would immediately leave this man I'm living with and go with Maynard and I thought that one there is that how unfair that that that this man that I am in love with now do I live with will always be second in my heart can I thought that touch stuff that's wrong that was just so wrong to me I ended up breaking up with him shortly after that. That was in 2007 and I've never dated since I just I'm very happy I know I'm one of the luckiest people in the world for the relationship that I had with Maynard was unique unfortunately we all my friends would say when they think was off I want to Maynard you know everybody wanted a man like Maynard and and and I realize how lucky I was and I'm I'm so happy for what I have and I see friends know who struggle who are looking I want somebody to love you know they go out in the date on the timer on the dating sites and they go to the bars and they said they they they have this need to have this man in their life and I don't think I I had I had the perfect relationship and I know that I probably can never find another man like Maynard this episode is going to come out on September 10th what is it that you want people to think about what is it that you want them to know maybe turn the vision around a bit and not look at it so much as the attack that happened on America but think about the people there were so many people of so many different races so many different ages so many different they were there people from all over I don't think people realize the number of people that come from so many different countries and I know how much I feel alone making Atlanta but I couldn't imagine how these people feel being on the other side of the world haven't gone to this but I guess think about the families think about the families who the loss of people that were in there I mean there's you know we are nothing special we are all just normal everyday people you know my husband put on a business suit and went to the office and I suppose flixbus just that the family that were left behind I'm Norma Kearney and this has been terrible thanks for asking Humpty Joe is our senior producer Marcel Malik Abu is our associate producer I just wanted to remind everyone he was promoted on this job is in jeopardy Tamika cross is our project manager keeps us on track keeps us working Jordan turgeon helper of all kinds Ariana Giles intern extraordinaire and a wagle Ki keep keep player on the Chain pinch hitter turn on a sports team 8 you can find me online at Nora Borealis.
