Com Graham offer code Graham ISO getting into the reason that everyone is listening today today is the 18th anniversary of September 11th is crazy right crazy to think about that in fact I'm friends with this girl on Instagram her name is Hannah Barron she's this Hunter / neuter nudler outdoor first and she sponsored by Realtree and all these other things and she posted today and this is not knocking her this is just wow it's really been that long she says I don't remember very many things from kindergarten think about that I mean kindergarten there are I mean literally I mean that there are people that are voting age today that do not remember 9/11 the only reason they know 911 cuz they read about it in a book you know I mean that it's crazy to think about that and so I made a post on social media not even our two hours ago and I kind of wanted to talk about this actually let's do something that that I think would be really cool to talk about where we were really quick what went with that happen. You know I know that on the on the outside of things it could seem like this is getting repetitive write this 18th here but I think it's important never forget about 9:11 so to say. You know like like like you know the greatest Generation I mean they all went Pearl Harbor day that live in infamy right that that that was there well 911 is ours and I mean it's an unfortunate thing but you know I still at it's so crazy there certain points in life where people say they'll always remember where they were right JFK Pearl Harbor 911 so I do man I remember it like it was yesterday I was I was a freshman in high school when 9/11 happened and I wish I was in first. Mississippi studies so we're learning about corn or something like that in Mississippi God bless you popcorn and the way our high school was set up an end in America let us know where you were at and I'm curious if anybody had similar experiences to me so I was in high school and every room had a TV in it and we used to have this thing God I can't remember what the name of it was but for homeroom everyday you know we had home run before classes start all the TVs would come on and it be like this new show for kids for like high school kids anyway so I'm in first. And the principal comes over the intercom and I'll never forget his young people that's how he always said young people I'm going to Halt education for the moment. Something has happened and I really think that you should turn your TV's on right now show me her that we're thinking what in the world is mr. Putnam thinking talking about those nightmares Putnam friends will put ya and but being in Mississippi so we have no clue what was going on it wasn't until second. When I got into a coach Lee's biology class but the TV was on and by that point that that's when the second plane hit like I remember right when I walked into second. Damn second plane hit and I remember sitting in there and it was during second period that the town that the towers fell and went down and Coach Lee I didn't know this at the time cuz I was just a freshman coach Ali was a first sergeant in an MP National Guard unit I didn't know anything about any of this stuff back that so thinking back about that now watching coach Lee watch that I mean he knew man I mean he knew that that we were going to war man I mean there was no way that it wasn't having it wasn't going to affect everyone's lives and all the stuff we didn't do school the rest of the day today in the whole day we watched that and I'm even into the night and I remember watching the first initial strikes you know that the night vision things and watching Bush come on and talk and all that stuff what about you what about you Alyssa where were you homeschooled during that time so I was a freshman as well and I remember waking up to my mama sobbing and I jumped out of bed thinking you know I didn't know cuz that's not normal Occurrence at our house and so I'm running down the hallway and looking at her looking at my sister who was already at Nita and then just looking at the TV and the first one had hit until we watched yeah we said we watched the second day at work he was at work so course we are calling him and and just trying to yeah like everybody just super glue to the TV a day all night praying I remember was praying I remember on Candlelight by Justin Bieber West Point are Tiny Town just automatically everyone coming together and calling everybody and what can we do how can we help like instantly said just feeling helpless and like you're just sitting there watching a feeling so helpless and I'm so that's that's where we were John and we had no idea what was going on the teachers were like running in and out of the room so we are kind of like what the crap is going on you know it and I didn't really none of us really knew what was going on and I got home and just started hanging out in my bedroom and my mom comes in the room crying and tell me what happened and that's when I knew like okay this wasn't just like an accident in ass was intentional and the fear in my mom's eyes really hit me and still does that's like my biggest memory of the day cuz you know they were other 10 since I remember just that day that feeling of just over Columbus Columbus's the de-facto pilot training gas and tell the pilot training bases and stuff you know I'm going to share something that I've never shared with a whole lot of people just just very few people it is coach Lee's class at and this just this goes to show you how moments can change people right and I'm going to get into the whole how 9/11 affected all of us and in the end cuz it did it was truly one of those life-altering kind of events even the people that weren't there life-altering but a situation happened in second. With Coach Lee that I'm not proud of Child Support teen year old kid I'll never forget I wasn't I wasn't laughing at the situation but something happened right after the towers fell and we were sitting there watching and it was like a weird camera cut like they were trying to cut to a camera and somebody just made this really weird noise before the camera cut or something and I remember a group of us in the back just being stupid kids you have started giggling about it like it like that noise and I'll never forget coach Ali Just he didn't come unglued on us or anyting he walked right over to us and he looked me straight in the eye like a man you know like a straight up man and he said to you realize what has happened yeah your silence let me know that you know how tense it got really quick though he said do you realize that thousands at the time I thought like tens of thousands of people you know had died. He said you realize how many people have just died do you have any clue what this means do you have he even said it was almost like prophesied it he said we will be talking about this for forever do you have any idea what it should happen and that still sticks with me to this day because I do I treat obviously I still did dumb stuff in high school but but I truly believe that that was one of those moments where it was like wow I need to I need to grow up a little bit you know that kind of thing you didn't know others being a kid moments where I sit here and I go whoa you know he's right wow that was that was really really bad in a 5 minute or not I was really really bad but going back to what Jose and I want to get into my point of all this here in a minute but but 9/11 was one of those events you don't pass that Gear America you know please tell us your story I would love to read it and hear about it you know what did 9/11 do to you right eye what how did your life change from that moment because I know me yeah I was still just a freshman in high school but I can truly say that if it wasn't for 9/11 we would all that be here today where we are like in this building filming this podcast talkin to America right now I wouldn't be here because I have never even contemplated military service before until that and I'll tell you that the other thing that happened over the next three years of high school I saw countless teachers all these people were in the car and I had no idea are in the reserves didn't know had no clue they all left literally I've been pretty much all the coaches all the coaches at high school left all of gone 18 months what not fighting in like the initial invasions and all that stuff I mean it and being in Mississippi we were really patriotic school not there are Patriot High School but Mississippi is just known for being a little more time and it really just molded this sense of you know how you know we could cuz when you're a kid you think about the military you think that they're like these otherworldly people almost you know like Robocop and things like that but during that time frame in high school it kind of molding me to go man these these people are just people like like us and they got family and all this stuff Todd you know Todd Todd with my recruiter he's a he's a good friend of me now he deployed and came back and then you got a recruiting tour I probably never would have join military if it wasn't for for Todd and that led me to in fact go direct why so you know and fighting in the war that I saw initiated that day in a second. When I saw it and in freshman year who knows babe I mean me and you may not be married if I had to join the military and and all that stuff I would not I would not have had the the Swagger so to say after I said catch her attention at the time and at the end of the day who can who can deny pinpal and somebody in Iraq that's my point right I mean if it hadn't been for that day who knows where I would be right now you know I have no clue I know that that day specifically and just without question set my entire life on a different path and so it's just crazy to me to think about that do you guys have I mean patriotic Duty that's kind of what I see like everybody leaving town that's there that's a personal responsibility of Freedom got to like no country can have complete freedom and complete Security at the same time North Korea has a lot of security they're pretty internally secure but with no freedom and it's kind of similar to the gun debate you know they they want to be so secure and I want to get rid of all guns but at the expense of Freedom so we're never going to have complete Security like that never want this to happen again but yeah so we defend our families defend our fellow citizens the risk of our own life so we can fight for the freedoms we do have you know we'll never have complete Security and we accept that and that's why half the town left and went and fought you know overseas cuz that's that's the personal responsibility possibility for the freedoms we do have here and I agree and so what I want to talk about today is I want to talk about the fact I wrote something before it well actually you know what before I get into it let's get internet sponsor it and then then I really want to I really want to dive into this soap here Wego chat pack is the Premier monthly subscription box for military tactical and second amendment enthusiasts for just 4995 a month they ship you at least $100 worth of gear from companies like 511 text Meg Mission first tactical armaspec and America grip to name a few they ship out AR-15 parts everyday carry tools knife cleaning kit in a mix of other tactical gear and apparel direct to you sign up today to get the October tacpack before they run out this pack value is $110 worth of gear from our respect at fire and War Machine sling in the fall season with this AR Builders dream pack and yes sling is a he go to takw pack.com and when you use the promo code to rent at checkout now ship you an abkt folding knife absolutely free so if you're into tactical gear from the best companies for half the price tag pack is for you go to tacpack.

Com offer code rant all right so I'm get a little raw for a minute I'm going to read something that I wrote okay because I really try to put my thoughts down a lot of you and probably seen the tweet that I put out and it basically I said the best way to honor the victims not 11:00 is for us to live like it's September 12th because September 12th was a day where did matter what race you where did matter what gender you where did measure your politics or anything like that we realized on that day that the only thing that matters is that we're Americans and I just think it would be this powerful is world-changing thing if we would just remember and live everyday like it was September 12th and how America always America forever and so anyway I wrote this and I I wrote it while looking at a photo that I took at the 911 memorial okay so there's a picture of me standing at the memorial and I was just looking at in a wrote it so this is what I said and forgive me if it's grammatically not correct I just got to run it free thinking so September 11th 2001 as I stood before this hallowed Place 18 years ago to the day when time Stood Still when we have the nation watch The Towers fall watch the pensacon burn in the words let's roll showed a moment of true sacrifice aboard Flight 93 as Real Americans prevented yet another hit on American soil a day when we actually stood Together As Americans in the face of Despair I can't help but think of where we are now hate groups running rampant racial and political divide calls for Monument removals calls for presidential assassination from elected officials you have to ask yourself the question where did we go wrong what happened to us as a nation in an age where we are more connected than ever before through technology it seems we are further apart than we have ever been so what are we going to do America it's true there is never any room in America for bigotry or hate but neither is division the truth is we are together or not we are either all in on this idea that is America or not I wonder what the people who witnessed that tragedy 18 years ago who were United as one people and we're simply Americans would say to us now would they be proud of the steps we've taken since the day Americans stood together as one nation in the face of true opposition or would they not recognize who we are or what we've become what I think about that day I don't think about Terror I don't think about weakness I don't see black and I don't see white and I do not see politics of who is right and who is wrong I think of a rallying Cry For America and the Awakening of what makes Americans truly great they each other we are the problem but we're also the answer think about that and never forget Americans first Americans always so I wrote that thinking about that thing and so it just I don't know a kind of wanted to open it up for discussion a little bit has take your America let us know what you think and I know this is a little different than how we normally do things but you know it's September 11th I think it's important to be reverent not every thing should be a gimmick all the time yeah we have a certain flow in a certain field on the show but I just believe the stuff to be important and so I think it's a very valid question to ask ourselves you know we see how Society is here we literally just talked about you can't even say guys anymore without Maple finding a fence to thing you know I don't know you think about the people that were there think about the people that lost their lives at you think about the family members you think about all the people that stood together as one 18 years ago what happened you know what they'd be proud of us I don't think so I don't I don't believe they would I think if you went back in time on September 12th and said 18 years from now we are going to be more divided than we've ever been before I mean do you think that they would they would imagine that I don't know I mean we are pretty full rides right now but that what makes it tough is how the left hates America they make death threats to the president they're racist against white people cuz why people have white privilege and claim that the white people are so it's like we can't just have civil discussions about you know policy or anything because the sides hate each other you know the right because they feel so hated from the left and because some of the things left are doing like drag queen story hours and the alphabet people and hating the president hating America and it's it makes it really tough just be Americans and you know I don't want to say that the left are not Americans obviously but when they hate the whole point you know they hate America and it's hard to have discussions with people who can legally be something and not morally be something legally there Americans morally I don't know but they wanted a new America the way they were being American is far more than a legality right being an American is far more than will you were born here so you're an American or your parents were Americans so good it's a mindset or mindset it's a value system of belief in a moral standard that you live by in a love for the blessings that we have and you have to ask yourself in 2019 the 18-year anniversary September 11th have We As Americans done right by the victims and the memory that they leave behind and created and and further in Transtar belief in America or have we kind of turned our backs on what what made America great September 11th was a horrible day September 12th is what makes America great and you just have to ask yourself the question in 2019 have we lost that I don't think we've lost it and I don't think they would be proud or not proud of us necessarily cuz they had their own separate issues going on back in 2001 it is a reminder though that we need to work on this polarization and and not think I'll be just because you believe that you should take my guns away You're a terrible person that needs to you know it's like we severely disagree with each other on this topic but we're still Americans but but why we need tragedy to remind us that all this stuff the end of the day that were arguing over times create weak men and I agree but what I'm saying is it seems like the only time that we can get along it's almost like a dysfunctional family right family that never ever ever ever taught you seen this movie a hundred You Know You Don't Know What You Got Till It's Gone yeah and then there's a death in the family that brings them all together and then they finally start talking again and all that kind of stuff right it's the same Cindy on a much larger and grander scale that is the entire population of America but it just makes you sit here and wonder why in the world do we need such horrible events to happen for us to pull together as a society doesn't that in fact show us that a lot of the things that were are not everything you know you know abortion rights or pro-life rights I mean those are very big on right issues gun-rights I mean yes there are things that we should metaphorically go to battle over to decide what's best for our society but a vast majority of the things that we fight about bicker about argue about the word odour for the the actual owner of a team and stuff like that work guys whether or not transgender people can go into a girls bathroom when they're not you know I mean like just dumb stuff that we're truly divided over man does it prove that that's really just not that important anyway when huge events terrible events like that just push it all to the side I don't know that but for me it's just thinking that we're not going to call this forever we've got other things to talk about but one last thing I want to do is I want to take about five seconds of silence for the memory of the victims and the firefighters firefighters and police everyone that lost their lives on 9/11 five seconds of Silence alright so okay let's read this thing back up a little bit I have something funny to bring this back up but before we do let's get into our last sponsor is your

Com that's the letter i bro.com offer code Graham so touchy back on a topic that we talked about I don't know two episodes ago we talked about Monopoly for Millennials and then Alyssa you said something do they have a monopoly for socialism and sent me to take a shower on direct message that they actually do you can get it on Amazon apparently really that's a real that's a real thing so I saw this from CNN yesterday Monopoly has decided to take its fight to misogynistic viewpoints Monopoly I'll be available Ms. Monopoly by the way you're right I'm not married correct yes I am ISS is widowed it went down OMS is Miss Mrs is like Mary did you know really know that there's Mrs which is married there's a switch is not married and then miss is like like widowed Google is dumb ugly stupid what is m i s s stand for our anyway you looked at a I'm pretty sure that that's their they're divorced or widowed or something because it's me because there is a difference anyway what's a feminism thing to them is because they don't want to be I'm not missed call Meme is wow I think you're so wrong what is this a widow is traditionally addressed as mrs. still so you don't want okay well I'm an idiot then I could have sworn that one out fine being wrong hey guys this is real reviation Ms it's just there's not three different ones all right fine when we got documentation in the back fine I'm wrong maybe that's just some weird Mississippi folktale my grandparents tell me Monopoly who knew that my grandparents didn't know everything all right moving on all right back to what I was saying so miss Monopoly is in play all right but here's the part that's crazy to me this whole thing about feminist and all the stuff is about equality right like that's what it's supposed to be they want to be on the same level as a little bit higher listen to the rules of Monopoly look like the classic game women will collect 240 Monopoly bucks when the When they pass go while the male players will collect the usual to hunt that's that's a fun new take on the game that creates a world where women have an advantage often enjoyed by men I don't remember ever collected more than $200 when I passed go what the crap are you talking about people wage Gap myth how is it that you're fighting for equality when you're going to create games I don't get it man can you imagine playing that game with like a place you want to know if something don't make any freaking sense at all put it to the kid test and the kids go wait just a minute there ain't no way it would flip that board but you would be picking data you know I will not say her name but someone wrote actually me and bring them in a similar situation so you need to talk into it and will bring it tonight so the Army's updating their PT test to the new Army Combat fitness test and it's a gender-neutral so she said why I can't just skin Pain by and get 300 on the female stealing more I can see why there are we changed it was the military after spayed okay so so what she meant by that just Skip Along and get it 300 the AP ft is what we took when I was at okay and that is 2 minute sit ups 2 minute push up to my run okay they were different that that they change it based on age and gender rights over for the males for example an 18 year old male has like 15 minutes and like 50 seconds to finish two miles or they fail that's like the what's the slowest you can run it buddy that is the slowest the females could run it what be like what like the oldest age male to pass it in at 18 19 minutes that's a lot of time I'll run it let me tell you how crazy all these steminist that wanted gender equality for everything are so the second they get it for a physical event tears everywhere I belong to an all-female officer Facebook group every day there is a non stop bashing of the new test and how these women think it's the Army's way of kicking out women they finally get what they've been wanting but only now the equality back to visit in their favor so they feel targeted to fight this battle all the time when I was an NCO okay I will get super mad because the Army puts a huge emphasis on the physical aspect of things they've done a lot better and made a lot of improvements of how they like you know approved for promotions and all this other kind of stuff but the old standard still applies who ran faster you know what I mean. Or who had the higher PT score so I always would argue that if I was equal and every other aspect with a female NCO but she whooped my butt on the PT test it's because it was easier 5 more minutes to run the thing you know give me 18 minutes to run it and I guarantee you know that was always this huge argument you know what they told us suck it up run faster anyway I got you know there's a conspiracy that it's China and Russia influencing our social media to look to for these tests like they're lowering the test a week in our military so they're doing all this social media for about it together as think I don't know a lot of this started because you got females going to Ranger school and stuff like that now and you can't lower the standards for that kind of stuff then they have to do that but you don't have to take separate Army is never has been military General they don't ever make rules about Exceptions there like okay if if we're going to start opening up combat MO message to women did not come out with a new test as gender-neutral that puts everybody on a level where they can actually do this crap right and so that's the thing that's fine to me so women have been fighting for forever cuz I want to be a man that will be equal man they want the same opportunities they want the same this saying that but then now this is this is so I'm assuming she's a female officer she's got to be to be in at Facebook. She says that you know people are just up in arms about it because it's the Army's way of getting rid of women don't say you want to kick in the NFL in the second you get hit by some 280lbs back of your comrades and throw them on your shoulder and dragged another one you better be asked wrong person to do that I need to be harder for women and here's why it's a lot harder for 120 pound female to pull some 250 lb dude 250-pound you can literally pick that woman up with one arm and got to you and it's going to make her more vulnerable to cuz she's taking a lot longer to to pick these guys up and get him to say to You. Tube to be clear I've never been the guy that says that I mean are there still some jobs in the military that I don't think women can do gas because there's something biological differences as well like you know we got the field 4 weeks never bathe nothing and then the females will actually have to like go in and shower and stuff and then come back you know kind of thing because I don't know you guys will get infections and exceptions like a female could do it but music that's just my opinion on some of these, unless it's not the ones you know but there are women that can do it. What I'm saying but you can't I don't nobody ever said even if you pass a test now we don't want women in here yeah you do the same, Terry this debate is way before lightning yeah this was going on and me and my friends like 10 points higher on their PT score but they're on a completely different what grading scale to the fact that we're different men are stronger they're saying hey we need to lower this test so we can make it in so are you not as strong as man is that what you're saying America let us know what you think I say good for the army man make it gender-neutral makes it a little easier for the dude's little harder for the ladies evens the playing field for weekends are military take it so basically this woman came in on a Tuesday afternoon and shop for a DVD she approached the checkout counter gave her number to the employee important part to look up her account the boy then says open put it out on the counter stating she got a gun before it says show she demanded money with her hand inside Earl Sweatshirt as if she had a weapon and Reports say the employee gave the woman an undisclosed amount of money as you fled the store cops obviously caught up to her very quickly because she had given her number to look up her account to the clerk before she brought them split minute decision like what is the logic cuz she's going to read Uber I love stupid people make my day is going to be the more new thing else I got a phone says napping could be good for your heart or Napper it will be out and Beyond me to check if I'm laying down for a nap at least hour-and-a-half wake me up if you wake me up I'm worse than I was before I lay down I think there's a part you can hash tag Dear America if you are a woman can take a power nap like I think it's almost train cuz I used to not and then after babies I can take a 10-minute nap and I am like good there is nothing that will make me burn the house down if I may call you that if men lay down we're laying down you know what I mean how many women has no difference is no difference at all what is it Google but let their people take a nap hey Google that's what I want to know by Gotye some characters have to cross a new study shows too many young women are unable to find a suitable husband go figure today I need to do a better job of courting these women it may be the man shouldn't feel like you know I shouldn't have to be so careful you had the right word I saw another report I saw another report it said it's hard for women to find an adequate male partner because males typically artist smart and don't make enough money this was obviously done by somebody in like New York City so I'll just that and a vast majority of women have a higher education the men I could see that because men are probably like 12 day old school at least we say this okay now disclaimer I'm not saying this is the case for everyone I know plenty of women that have done it all of their own however I know a far larger amount of men that have been working since marriage the spouse goes to school to finish their degree so I think that is a complete garbage and honestly borderline insulting kind of thing because there are a lot of men they go work you know swing shift 12-hour hard labor jobs every single day so they can go to school payment that wasn't it get their education and I don't see that it's just a lot of people that some of the basis of the wage Gap argument because they say when women don't make as much as men in this field or in this field when men make more and some but women in my opinion it's in their genes to be caretakers and to stay home with the kids riding and the ones that go out and get jobs all the more power to him but then that means the man has stay home or your kid is raised by babysitter his whole life right so it's trade-offs it if if you want to work you know that's just what's going to happen so you got a guy let's say I don't know take take a construction something when you construction you know you're you're an architect or something like that okay will you got a girl that goes to be an architect all right she gets her degree and all the stuff she tries to go for an architect job and then a dude beats are out what the thing that they never talk about is that yeah he may have the same degree as you but he also actually work in construction for 10 years to get himself to that point with that kind of stuff right now and I think it again disclaimer on this ladies ladies ladies I love you and I know that you are capable of amazing things that I have no some of you didn't have no help from no man and you did it all by yourself and I think that you are off for it I am talking about the vast majority of situations I think that it is garbage when they say that men don't have a high enough education to marry somebody office are you love your job piece of paper on the wall and is a douchebag or you'd rather have some dude that can barely add but by God he loves you and will take care of you like a lot of what you go for looks you go for money. All of us looks not sure though you got you start to realize you know they say money goes who cares are they going to treat you right and love you and respect you the other thing is you know women can't find a suitable mate because like Micah said a couple weeks ago dating is not in a people are dating right I know that they're sleeping together first night first date no second night I haven't said that in a while. You decided the peep the ladies that say that their man has to make a certain amount of money I would venture to say that they are in their thirties they are single and they know we're close to get married because of you are a pompous selfish and title think that your holier-than-thou enough person that you put a certain money figure on the right type of person that can be your partner for the rest of your life you are an idiot and you deserve to be by yourself sorry that's just the way it works how dare you of what they could be down the road based on their bank account number right now you could be three hundred more pounds by the time this is all over with and you're going to want somebody to stick with you based off what you look like now but you're going to put up a financial figure on some dude Hypocrites Hypocrites Financial figures but you can say hard-working sit there by yourself with your dog who has a Facebook account that you answer people for irritates me dude these people that say this stuff are in their 30s they're single they never been engaged or ain't never been married there at home with their dog on your kind of generalizing now that's probably not all of them are vast majority this flavor for the majority I'm just saying hi stranger America let me know what you think I can some people that's okay you can have them put to just like we got it babe we're good I'll move on so he wants all rights every single right except for gun rights they said a short commute to work is a god-given well I saw that old house or condo or apartment so people don't have to commute very far but they got low working job cost so much money for all this about a cup of coffee is a god-given right away. That works for everyone to marry someone that makes at least six figures drives a Bimmer have a cold beer waiting on when they come out or wait. I'm going to get in trouble with less on this one has God given right stuff that women want it is their god-given right to find a man this this this and that will then where's the Goddamn right for the men bar got it so we don't leave our God given right to come home and their dinner me back I hear how the beard of changes on that you get to pee standing I don't know I don't know I guess for the record I don't believe that I have never been that type of parts we get to grab I'll grab it on my way home. Have you ever been to a I never been into a men's restroom and up there is elevator music and couches in women's gatherings in the women that usually worse in the end real ladies you know what I'm talkin about you ladies are gross gross gross gross gross seat from time to time but by God we ain't leaving tampons and all that stuff short across the seat up when you're done borrow from moderate 9/11 victims did the difference between male and female restroom right on time well look at that right in an hour Jake look at us home alright thank you so much for joining this episode of the Dear America podcast if you love this show if you support this show tell Alfred get them to subscribe and give us five stars that helped us us in the ratings we are almost at 4000 star reviews in 3 months which is unheard of guess world thank you guys so much thanks for listening Alyssa where can I find you search for listening to this episode of the Dear America podcast and we'll see you again next time
