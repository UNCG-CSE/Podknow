it's Friday September 13th welcome to skim this we're breaking down the most complex stories of the day and giving you the contact on why they matter today we're diving into last night's Democratic primary debate and how the candidates differ on gun control will connect the dots on which proposals are being put forward and whether they have the support of the American public then the Bahamas is still reeling from Hurricane Dorian and now a new storm could complicate recovery efforts and finally that feeling you may be having today on Friday the 13th there's a word for that we're here to make your evening smarter Bucks game deaththe most complicated story today it's about gun control and what Democratic presidential candidates think should be done about it last night the top 10 candidates got together in Houston Texas for the 3rd Democratic primary debate on ABC and Univision they talked about Healthcare immigration foreign policy climate change it was a three-hour debate and we felt it but the big issue that stood out was how they talked about gun control we started off our show on Monday looking at Congress has plans to tackle it after a summer of deadly mass shootings but the executive branch is a whole different ball game and there were lots of ideas last night that spanned the American experience with guns from every day gun violence to mass shootings to the traditions of hunting and shooting for sport and that's what going to look at today so let's get into it starting with former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke who proposed a pretty big idea last night against a fellow Americans anymore o'roarke said assault-style weapons were designed for the battlefield with bullets that can shred through someone's body causing them to bleed to death he said these Firearms shouldn't be out in the streets and a majority of Americans agree with that after a mass shooter armed with an AK-47 style rifle killed 22 people in a Worx home town of El Paso pulls down that two-thirds of Americans think assault weapons should be banned or work said last night that he's spoken to gun owners who said they would willingly give up these kinds of weapons like in a buyback program Australia did a major gun by back in the 90s and New Zealand is doing one now after a mass shooting at 2 mosques in March but Americans are pretty much split on whether a buyback program like the one over work was talking about is a good idea and Senator Cory Booker made clear last night mass shootings aren't the only problem the u.s. is dealing with when it comes to guns he is seeing other problems like where he lives in Newark New Jersey seen what the Carnage creates in communities like mine because we forget National shootings he's these mass shootings are tragedies but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine hooker said that he was the first candidate to come out in favor of gun licensing since you have to take a test and get a license to drive a car Booker has said you should have to do that to buy a gun to pull show that a vast majority of Americans agree some states already require gun licenses and in those States the death rates are lower than in states without those licensing requirements take New Jersey for example Booker state it has some of the toughest gun laws in the US including a requirement to get a permit before buying a gun in 2017 the Centers for Disease Control and prevention said New Jersey had the six lowest Firearms death rate in the country mass shootings and everyday gun violence are both problems that candidates on Thursdays debate stage 1 and 2 address but there are also people who own guns for hunting or for the shooting range senator Amy Klobuchar represents Minnesota and he said before that she supports the gun rights of people like her uncle and other hunters in her home state here she was on CNN in February I always look at every proposal and say with this hurt my uncle dick in the deer stand so she took the more moderate line last night and focus on the parts of gun reform that actually unite the candidate that happens to include two bills waiting to be passed by the Senate right now both were passed by the house earlier this year and both have to do with background checks passing Universal background checks would mean that every single person who wants to buy a gun would have to have their name searched in a federal database of criminal and mental health records even if they're buying it at a gun show or from a private seller over 90 scent of Americans support Universal background checks on all gun buyers and you can't really get 90% of Americans to agree on anything here's Klobuchar last night talking about those house bills and also a bill of her own that would prevent more domestic abusers from getting Firearms if you want action now we got to send a message to Mitch McConnell we can't wait until one of us gets in Whitehouse we have to pass those build right now to get this done what's the scam we just went through three big ideas on gun control but as former Vice President Joe Biden pointed out last night the president can't really take things into their own hands and banned weapon it's in the Constitution that people have the right to bear arms but California Senator Kamala Harris disagreed with Biden she said in the past that if Congress didn't take up the issue choose an executive order to regulate guns Just say Hey Joe it's saying that we can't let say yes we can and O'Rourke has pitched a different kind of work around on gun control calling for banks and credit card companies to refuse to process purchases of assault weapons or guns bought without a background check mean while the corporate world isn't staying silent yesterday nearly a hundred and fifty companies wrote a letter to Senate leaders demanding action on gun violence we're talking Twitter Uber and Airbnb and a lot of others it's the most concerted effort yet the business world to get in on the debate over gun control it's been almost two weeks since hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas it was one of the most powerful storms in history for more than 2 days is battered parts of the country and we're only just starting to get a sense of the toll the storm took on the people who live there in the Bahamas thousands of people are still in government shelters thousands more have evacuated the islands and a few days ago the Bahamas government said around 2,500 people were still missing after authorities were able to figure out where people had fled to or were taking shelter they now say the total number of missing people is closer to around 1,300 right now the death toll in the Bahamas is at 50 the Prime Minister of the Bahamas thinks that number could rise significantly during a visit to the Bahamas this afternoon un secretary-general Antonio Gutierrez describe the Staggering damage caused by Hurricane Dorian and said that in some areas more than three-quarters of homes have been destroyed but he encouraged people there and elsewhere to look past this one storm and start preparing for stronger and more frequent storms in the future that will happen as a direct result of warming oceans Financial cost of the damage caused by dog in is not clear but it will be in the billions of dollars and the Bahamas cannot be expected to. Is Bill alone these new upscale climate remake cities last name of the new multilateral response and businesses around the world to contribute to a 100 billion dollar yearly fund to help people adapt to the changing climate especially those in the developing world that talking point will likely come up again in a few weeks at a un climate Summit in New York the one 16 year old climate activist Greta tuneberg sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to attend the Prime Minister of the Bahamas could also be there but for now he's got a more immediate priority dealing with yet another storm forecaster say the storm could hit the Bahamas tonight and tomorrow though there's still a chance fingers crossed it'll fail together steam along the way this morning the skin hosted to incredible gas for a power breakfast at HQ and they blew us away Jodi Kantor and Megan chewy are investigative reporters at the New York Times in October 2017 they broke the story that Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein have been paying off sexual harassment accusers for decades the story helped Propel the me-too movement into a global dialogue Weinstein since been fired from the production company he helped found and is now facing sexual assault charges in New York that trial starts in January but Weinstein's trial might not provide the closure that some may need since they're still a lot about the way the justice system treats allegations of sexual harassment here's Cantore today a lot of the allegations against Weinstein or about sexual harassment this is confusing but it's important sexual harassment is illegal but it's illegal under civil law you can't throw somebody in jail for sexual harassment you can only basically sue them so prosecutors they can't they can't work with sexual harassment cases right they can't work with the assault cases that are beyond the statute of limitations in New York so that leaves them with a couple of women story is that this whole thing is based upon and then to to to make matters even less certain at this point we don't know who one of the key victims even is there's a woman with a rape allegation is very much at the center of the case but she's never been identified she hasn't come forward to journalists we haven't talked to her etc etc all of which means that this trial is just looking to us like kind of an unstable proposition like a cat like we don't know what direction it's going to go in and we're not we're not willing to draw any conclusions about what's going on babe estate for anybody to view this trial is the final kind of conclusion of Harvey Weinstein's innocence or guilt she said is out now if you want to hear more of today's fascinating conversation our special episode of skin from the couch drops this coming Wednesday to make sure you don't miss it subscribe today on Apple podcast or wherever you get your podcasts before we go today we've got a fun fact about tonight we got a full moon coming our way the Harvest Moon plus it's Friday the 13th so if you believe in these things get ready for a double whammy of strange occurrences and bad luck if you're feeling a little spooked there's a word for that a very long one paraskevidekatriaphobia it's Greek for fear of Friday the 13th here it is again but slower paraskevidekatriaphobia paraskevi is Friday and dekotora means 13 you're welcome and good luck out there tonight and that's all for skimmed this thanks again for listening and be sure to hit subscribe and rating review us wherever you get your podcast a lot of news happens over the weekend so to catch up first thing on Monday sign up for our morning newsletter the daily skimm at this Kim.com is everything you need to know to start your day right in your inbox
