Sounds good and it's her pick a choice rather than coming up with something out of nowheredo I have to say I failed to do this just the other day LOL well someone injects class was sick and she had to go to the hospital should have high fever and I emailed the mom who looks very close to us and I said you're so close we're here all weekend we don't have any plans let me know if I can help but now I'm thinking what I should have done it said like can I bring Bagels Saturday morning would you like me to come by and feed your cat you know I should have offered something cuz it's just a standard thing up when you just say what can I do I was just loading more on her shoulders when she was already you know concerned about her daughter and involved in that has any were thinking oh we lived close so that would be something that we could do we could go get their newspaper I don't know people still get newspapers but you know like we could go pick up my newspaper or whatever by because you was going to have a special role to play since you were likeclose together I remember I don't know where I heard this example with I read it in a book or like maybe a listener suggested an email but her thing was like she would contact I'm in Target right now what do you need or I'm in the grocery store right now what can I pick up for you and she said that like that kind of help people be like oh my gosh you know what I need diapers for my other kid or I realize we just ran out of milk if you can pick up milk because the idea that you're not making a special trip but you're just standing there right now and she thought maybe easier for people to say actually there is something you could do for me and I think what's also nice about that is it's like showing I really want to hang out the sometimes gestures of offering help our sort of empty gestures it's like let me know if I can do anything but in reality you don't want to help you're just saying that or you can't you don't know what to do so you leave it on the other personwe get out with her is that yes and so I think the more specific it is the more the receiver of the help is going to feel like I owe this person really wants to help I'm not burdening them this is something they want to do you know when their situations that are really tough there is a great book by Emily McDowell which we talked about before called there is no good card for this what to say and do when life is scary awful and unfair to people you love and one of the things she pointed out notebook which I have to say I had not thought of and it was a really good point which is sometimes a desire to be helped can become burdensome on its own and I think if I remember correctly she gave an example of someone who's like Elizabeth I know you're in the hospital I really want to get your slippers so what's your size would you rather have cotton or wool there's like you might like a bright color like purple or do you like okay now you have a homework assignment like as so her point was just like don't make it a burden you want to help but you don't want your help to become unhelpful and I had just never thought aboutthat I can easily see myself sort of drifting into that without realizing it yeah I remember is even if you don't cook like I don't cook so I'm not the person that's going to bring a lasagna there are other things you can do for his since Gretchen one time when I was insanely busy you offered which was still unbelievable to me that you had this you offered to buy Christmas presents on my beach nuclear family we do a stocking exchange everybody draws a name I don't know who I had that you're let's say it was Mom and you said all get Mom's presents for you I'll take that off your plate and oh my God it was such a huge relief because even though I normally like doing this talking I was just so overwhelmed but you could do that on a much smaller scale and just say hey I know there's you know a birthday party this weekend can I pick up the gift for Joe for youwhen I thought it I guess I was like this is the best gift of all time because I knew that you were like it was probably just blowing your mind that you had to like run out and you know it's like a lot of little errands and if you're like in the holiday spirit but okay this is knocking it out myself on the back for that many as you should give up what it is a friend of mine emailed me before I was having a party and you and I both talked about like we don't entertain all that much time can get kind of wigged out about it at so friendless like you want me to come over and help and I was like I don't need your help but will you come right on time so you're like the first person here are like the second person here will be comforting to me that you're here so just come right on time don't be like you know Sunday's usually wait like 15 or 20 minutes to sort of like that's kind of the protocol or whatever I was like don't do that come on the. And she did was just her being there made the party field fun instead of me having that uncomfortable feeling of lawI just waiting for that first buzzer you know and that was really helpful I would say the opposite side of this is also feel free to tell someone something concrete just do you know cuz I was like can you bring ice we were out of ice and I just said to someone can you stop and get ice and I did and it was frightened you know so also on the other side of it if you know you need something ass don't make people guess what you need so it sort of goes both ways I think General offers to help are comforting but when you see what it would actually look like it's a lot easier to take it or offer it and so on but it does take some effort and so that's why making a concrete offer is a generous thing to do so that's a great idea from our listeners let us know if you do try this at home and how making a concrete offer has work for you baby do you have examples of when you either received or made a concrete offer let us know an Instagram Twitter Facebook drop us an email at podcast with Gretchen Rubin.

I'll post a picture of like what the statue looks like and the badges and again this was not elaborate or fancy this was right and it just a favor talk about and something to do and so I can imagine a very small office or doing this coming up with some concept and again having to speech of an ongoing fun thing that people do it's not that expensive and it's a good way to bring people together and have fun as a team so I thought this was a great but I guess yes absolutely next show I'm on sashes for everyone on a merit badge right at the other gold start the merit badge and now it's time for an interview with Kate bowler we are such fans of Kate bowler about four years ago Kate bowler was living an ordinary life she was 35 years old she was a professor at Duke Divinity School she was married with a new baby when she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer this experience forced her to reckon with her mortality in a truly extraordinary way she has grappled with this experience she has a terrific podcast which we highly recommend call everything happens and she has a New York Times best-selling Memoir called everything happens for a reason and other lies I've Loved loved and Kate I think you're having so Kate last we're not face-to-face you are in North Carolina that's what I have to say because I listen to podcasts all the time it feels totally ordinary that you would be this Invisible Presence talk to you later that's awesome I listen to you guys all the time so this is an extra special treat excellent so good but you are right and talked a lot about the very difficult situation that you find yourself in so do you want to set up for listeners kind of how that's going for you right now yeah well I was just trying to do the academic Super Plan where I just wanted to be a professor Johnson in my office with many bookshelves and to all of my books and at 35 with no family history of cancer I was suddenly diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and not really took apart the way I thought about my life and how I should spend my time and so I spent a couple years and after treatment and now thankfully I have graduated to six months and which means people look at me with a very concerned expression and then they send me off again so I'm really well considering but it's just giving me a very different approach to how I think about how I'm suffering and what are we get what we deserve and what we should do when you started writing about this almost immediately when I really just in the throes of your first treatment so how has it been going through this very personal health issues do in a public context was your family comfortable with it like your husband Tobin obviously is featured how is that been weird cuz I know it is public but like the writing process is so private like I'm so performatively cheerful like if you ask me how I am yes yeah yeah I'm just like always trying to get it together and I think waiting really took me to a very different place where I felt like I finally found a way to be honest and get right down to it which was a much deeper sense of outrage than I expected that I was a lot sadder and lonelier than I thought I would be with my illness and just how frustrating it felt to suddenly real tragic like you're at a party and you want to be the person like I'm always thinking like just please don't ask me what I write about or what's going on in my life and something that stuff out loud has been maybe one of the more liberating parts and it's been a weird but lovely thing for our marriage to is just to be able to stay in front of other people who have similar situation this is the world I now live in as a sometimes patient and I meet other people in Calvin my husband situation realize like wow patients and caregivers actually live in totally different planets and it's worth learning how we learn to love each other with very different roles for some people was it hard to go behind this kind of screen of cheerfulness and actually here I mean it's one thing you're in the hospital room and they see you acting a certain way but then later on they read like in your memory it's very powerful what you're going through or you say something to the doctor but then you report what was actually in your mind and I can imagine that for some people that might have been to sort of had that screen ripped away might have been difficult time like we think maybe we just lie to the people we love the most and for all kinds of reasons like we don't want it to be more painful for them we're all trying to figure out how to get through and also I was pretty sure I was going to die for the first couple years and so I just always wanted to leave things on a good note and so it was actually a miserable miserable so that's been a bit of a change like trying to practice being honest with the stuff that people can hear and you just kind of realized early on like some people just can't hear a thing with so it's actually not a good idea to say like well it's a terrible but for most people if you give it to them in a way they can kind of hook into especially if you can give them something to do yeah I've been there way more likely to be able to stand with the near you and your kind of going through your thing what's one of you guys just in the first second of this podcast. Offer offer somebody something concrete. They can do yeah I love that drive me bananas when it's like the nicest people say they will let me know if I can help you go cuz my brain is just on survival mode so I love it when people are like hey can I bring you dinner table Tuesday I love to say it's picking up on this idea of like what can people hear what are the things you write about in his heart of the title of the book people want to offer these platitudes like yeah everything happens for a reason or well at least you have a good talk but they want you to look on the bright side or whatever and yeah this is been very frustrating for you yeah how do we escape that desire to kind of let's look on the bright side here let's see the learning learning moment but yeah yeah and I think we could have so few cultural scripts for how to deal with other people's pain and so the ones that are available to us are the ones that are usually accidentally really cruel like a dessert of like a secret detective mode where they always want to figure out like that in my grandpa, that's just the race to figure out like yeah but why did it happen to you so that I'm face and that is kind of a terrible feeling to know that you're actually just being explained when you thought someone was trying to emphasize that the one most people go into the other is like trying to frame it for you so it's not as painful for you so that that's the only at least my only really want you to know you're getting great Medical Care and that things will probably be fine cuz they have just learned about it and we'll know it's just hard cuz all of them are completely understandable impulses really deep desire to relate like that and what's happening to connect and then also like off for the third most common reaction I get which is what when my aunt might have to like wanting to explain the last person they knew that probably died of something similar so many ants can you play I love it and I love in the books that you sort of have to appendix where your talk about what not to say and what ya say what a couple of the things that people can sex I think that's what we're all searching for I think that suggestion of a concrete ask is such a good one like rushing with something to help I would just get sold when people would send me like a playlist like something really simple a stupid plant like it doesn't have to be anything that helps them with their particular Illness but usually there's nothing to do so a very Philly or thoughtful or whimsical present is always nice to compliment because you feel really Eclipse by something you didn't choose and so what I can find something about you that doesn't feel like a eulogy like only on yourself so kind or I love the way you and just don't spend it a compliment that really went a lot to helping me figure out who can I still be and when I I wasn't sure who I was becoming and so your physical presentation the world changes it so that all of us be very unsettling because every part of your identity is not what it was yeah and you're not sure who you are like you're taking this weird middle place where you're afraid that you're never ever going to be out of it but you hope you well and so finding that sorta Sweet Spot between wanting to explain it away but also knowing that everybody lives and breathes some kind of hope and that a lot of it is just the willingness to stand near you and say something super simple like I'm so sorry this is happening to you like I must be so tough and then know that there's really nothing you can say and when someone might be actually doesn't expect anyone to fix anyting feel like you're off the hook like you can just be near me hopefully love me in some kind of way and then be mine early helpful any matches my black friend request early helpful I like them cuz you work at Duke Divinity School you write all my friends are pastors my colleagues teach Pastor my friends are pastors and my students are going to be pastors there is a flood of pastors not only in my room but in the nearby waiting room and ended preschools on Chapel where the community has decided to come together and pray me through my surgery and I can imagine that it one way this would be just a magnificent situation and I couldn't help but think like are there complications to that like the second tricky going on with laughing when you read that it reminded me of all the times I be like in the middle of having my bandages changed and like my student would be on chaplaincy duty at the hospital be like a lot of a lot of layers of anxiety give up on dignity you knew that people had a little bit of training around stuff they could do that could just kind of like uphold you so like for me knowing I'm being prayed for or just like a hand on my head or they let me to church has all these beautiful rights of like you know anyone can your forehead with oil or having a friend who come to that 4 a.m. moment right before surgery and just like crazy for you and the doctor nothing they can do except stand there and like wish you well in every cell of your being and not was I mean unbelievably touching did you ever feel like people were like they needed to feel that you responded in a certain way like that their words have landed or that you kind of were appropriate and your response was there any kind of like you were to perform it it was already have pressure in that well totally yeah I think I felt a lot of pressure to be everything in the right way so to be turn the right way so to always be Invincible to be a partner in the right way when you're just trying to make it easy for everyone else who loves you and and also as someone who's the person of faith I did try to feel like I was supposed to perform like the best kind of trust in God and that meant that I was always positive God was working it out for me and the truth is I have no idea what that language means I really don't like I know what it means to feel loved by God but I have no sense that I've entered into a contractual obligation which Gatos me certain things like including years of my life and so it did make me feel a little crazy when I felt like other people theologies were always being I was attacked case and he also see a logical problem wow it seems like he started an ongoing way obviously grappling with this entire situation one thing you talked about in an episode with Alan Alda which was great which is how your mind works along two separate tracks for thing about time and making plans what is that like it's like holding these two things yeah well like one is always planning for the best and I'm making you know I'd put money in my retirement account and I am expecting to be the unbelievably emotional pair to drop my kid off at college that kind of thing and then the other is like but what if and then I am making much more short-term plans in which every time something like I'm in Professor world and the one person started describing the other day there like fourth trip to the archive and it was like 2 hours in and only and I said I don't have time for this interesting would never have thought about that before you have a very low tolerance for this kind of boring double math going on and I see why I relate so much to the work that you go there doing no because there's a a real desire to maximize joy in a tight time frame and to want to know that everything count and so that's an experience I have a lot which I know is it's going to pay off in a way that is most deeply meaningful write like thinking about what is the thing that's going to add value what is the thing was just the fantasies self or other people sort of empty requirements that I can't just maybe I can just figure out a way to get out of this conversation because I really don't have to sit here and tell how big the exciting combination of hydropower and Brianna gonva file so funny it just makes me less some before and that was like super achiever math it like if I just put in it like I'm like life is his bank account and it's some point there's going to be there to pay off in 15 years and then I realize like it first of all I might not make it fifty years I really hope I will but in the meantime like what are the ways in which I can be most like what's the gift I can give based on the best work I can do now in the most loving way and that is really kind of changed my perception on I don't know what I'm supposed to do so I definitely like pulled it back a bit my horizons a bit tired but I actually think it's maybe like a bit richer than it was before one thing at a cursive I imagine you have really talked about this but you know you're so out there with your own story and you have this podcast which really people then feel very intimately connected to you so I imagine that many people come to you who want to share their own experience and is that tough to be the recipient of so many people going through so many intense and difficult circumstances do you find it energizing and uplifting do you find it overwhelming how to set back up on you as sort of a person with whom they want to share the first reaction I have is oh my gosh life is so hard for everybody but it why is it so hard for everybody like why is it so hard to have you know people who love us and Healthcare and look at all these really basic things and you realize how fragile everyone is and that makes you just want to be like left grouchy in the checkout line you know that there were a couple places where people could share those kinds of ongoing realities without feeling like they could only talk to the bishop more space people cuz it's not even that every single person sounds like they're one crisis but they're defined by like their kids having a hard time their parents are in a care facility and they're struggling like we're totally taken apart by our big loves when I wish there was more some cultural permission to be fragile and to be in that liminal space that we all seem to be a where we're not totally sure that it's going to work out but we really need one another kind of Stephen with love wow well one thing that you really are able to do is to access humor and to maybe not like be cracking jokes so much as but to be light and to find a light way of talking about very heavy issues to sort of you said you kind of are performatively cheerful does that come naturally or do you lean into that have you really it made how do you think because I feel like sometimes people are like it's that whole I forget the name of the Doctor Who is like laughter is the best medicine and getting over the head with murder me for sure I will be very concerned that people are giving me more laughter at the hospital I do Ido honestly I think partly it's that the illness really hit the first realness and absurdity level of my life and so and also I have an overwhelming desire to feel like myself and so I don't want to stay on script forever are we doing cuz it's unbelievably boring but like just for example I had a surgery and have this I just like to move in my stomach which I didn't notice everything was like a bit of a mess down there that wasn't paying that much attention I need doctor came in and was like I'm here to take out the stupid your stomach pains I told you I'm here to take it out I would like am here to take us to better every time I made him reset I made him leave the room and come back in and let us being unbelievably good friends because we were laughing so much are play how badly did it the whole thing was going and I made it with him to do a magic trick by the end of you wonderfully oh my God moments like that where I felt most myself and also just able to accept the fact that I was like oh dear God what do you like week and so I think humor really helps me get there where I can feel like I'm still myself in a situation where I just never imagined I'd be he wrote about or maybe type it on the podcast where it allows you to kind of be demanding in a certain way in the best possible way it because you said like somebody came and it was like where I am in like the lowest level of doctor comes in his like oh by the way so I can blah blah blah blah blah okay now you have to hold my hand if we're going to do that's kind of in the super dark sense kind of funny but yeah that struck me to the core and I bet to that doctor it was a very striking and memorable moment which is like you can't say that without holding my hand but it's a light way of saying you just really miss handled this puts back it up and try again what I need and this is how you handle a human moment like that you can't just yeah yeah it's so hard to figure out of the human I think especially when things just get weirder and worse and I'd like to find a have less tolerance for pretending in that way and more of a desire to like connect it is probably just had a fear right like a lot of the Bible anytime an angel looks like don't be afraid it's cuz something absolutely terrified is just how the moments where it is not true that the older is nothing to be afraid of do usually is but like if we can figure out how to be ourselves and to connect like and if we can just be holding someone else's hair and it really does get a lot easier every guest to come to the show do you have a concrete suggestion for listener something they can try at home to be happier healthier more productive or more creative and I know you've spent so much time thinking about this looks like a simple thing that you think people can do you know I think maybe one of the strongest feelings I had when I got sick is that I didn't have anything good left to give and so honestly I would just every person especially if they're going through a hard time to know that they're very bad things are also still inside of them and that there are so many good gifts left to give and so I would just encourage people to like take a moment and either ask a friend to remind them what they're really good at but just do a little gift inventory like even if they're in the middle of something unbelievably terrible and no. Like they're not defined by the stuff that happens to them and hopefully there's just some minute where they can have a second to feel like they're still a good giver and not to receive one thing it's very striking that I think it's your gift is that so many people who go through difficult situations would love to Redeemer experience by thinking that they're helping other people and I think that is something that many many people want to do out of the greatest love but it is not a gift that everyone is able to give because it's very hard to talk about these things in a way that is accessible to other people and so I think you are doing it so well but then you're running with your podcast it is really a rare gift to think so much I'm so grateful for this this is some so lovely thank you it's so great to talk to you and we really appreciate you taking time out of your day to come talk to us you guys are awesome.

first day of 7th grade you know whatever and their their age and it's fun and I like the consistency because it's always done the same way you sort of you could see the changes in the outfits all that socially and I've been super conscientious about it so I have kind of don't break the chain going with that with allies of which is going back to college I specifically said okay for the last 2 years what I've done is I've taken a picture of her with her like bags packed kind of like off the college freshman year whatever like in our house because it's like you know whatever okay so she's going back to junior year I had to stop many times but then in the flurry of taking her to school I forgot and you're like okay well she could just do her own picture and hold up the sign but it's like one of these things were I reminded her like 3 times in the first time she's like I don't have any paper pen sound like you're in college I think you can get a computer paper and a pen because it's the kind of thing where until I get this fixed I have broken the chain I broke in the consistency that I wanted to have even the fact it's a little off to be kind of fun in retrospect but now it's turned into this like nagging thing because it's like my dog is but until I get it it's like she's off to college like I don't want this to dominate and I really want that picture of a Post-It note in the bathroom mirror saying don't forget to take the picture that morning because I knew okay we were getting up at you know whatever 7 a.m. to go by train would like these giant bags they obviously the kind of situation where you can forget now I'm totally distracted yes this is a trivial thing you know that's just something I like I learned a lesson there would write yourself a yes write yourself a note and you are a person who doesn't like to break the change of course it's going to bother you until much later and so was it like when we were off to college and on the train and a gold star Gretchen should go from the deepest of things we've been discussing in this episode 210 of the frothy assist us for the new reboot of Beverly Hills 90210 and everyone probably remember Hills 90210 and burst onto the scene and was a huge pop culture phenomenon and I loved it and I just love the way that they have rebooted it which is the character they're playing a version of themselves on the show so on the show Tori Spelling for instance is always worried about money which she is in real life and has many many children would she doesn't realize that has done lots of reality shows what she said in real life because of they're all sort of overly exaggerated versions of themselves trying to do a reboot why does think it turned out great I absolutely love it I just it entertained me it makes me smile I think they're all of their acting is improved over the years the one side note is Luke Perry die by the few months before this was filming so he's not on the show and his presence is definitely missed and they acknowledge that but everybody else including Shannen Doherty is on the show so anyway I just recommended for anybody who is a fan of the original I am absolutely enjoying
