It's technically a millionaire people called I hate you you're funny being myself I just saw used to do I don't know if I did it before I did not end on this series I did Bernie Sanders as a crosswalk guard hey mister what are they call you honey bunny send this is just different day Larry David really looks like Bernie Sanders and so that you and Phil Hartman back in the day you guys would play everybody yeah and then they going to do this thing of let's let's bring in Matt Damon let's bring in Alec Baldwin let's bring in they just it's different people allergy onion Robert De Niro and I wonder if that ever pisses off the cast or very lucky I didn't read it once and did Bob Dole but that was about it after I did George Bush Senior doing in doing that way you know what we're doing for our what are you doing I love you doing just read just back on people don't know in car right now he's going to drop me off in the car senior and I know really why goes cuz I didn't say I do is George Bush Senior making a list of what I'm doing in order to comment down so they like hair hair AR counter needs a friend, Matt son and Anna doing that thing talking Airwolf Stitcher Conoco monetization a fan of an accurate if an if an impression is incredibly accurate I get bored by it what I like is when people are silly putty and they stretch it out and so you would remember cuz I was there for the whole Arc of it you started doing George Bush Senior and then you can't you got to and I got to do it and I got to do it yeah by the end your gun cuz I thought you it's almost like you're going to go insane if you don't stretch it out to the point of absurdity Kevin things I get bored but I do think that that was such a slow build that the audience came along with me yes they do it by then that got here is something that is interesting I'm going to play this for you and they listen or so I have bronchitis in January so I had seen Paul McCartney on 60 Minutes and I realized that my Paul McCartney with bronchitis was a very different Paul McCartney and it seemed like a captured something so I started to record that morning cuz I knew I was going to run out of this when call comes off the road in the way talk so should I just pressed shy so here it is it is it just was a it's a once-in-a-lifetime chance to do a more accurate pain I was just riffing not trying to be funny so you know what she's doing in that you know this don't you know what I mean you know it's just change. O course I'm Only Sleeping with violins and you know bass over the summer is a do do do do do you know she's going to face in a drawer you know she got to find Budokan in the face you have to learn how to do him with bronchitis which is completely unnecessary different Rhythm but hold on hold on I want Paul is I know how he try so hard to be casual about everything so he when he references these iconic songs I love that he intentionally doesn't know the lyrics to The Beef was very lean you're like no that's not it and then duty duty to know that wasn't it at all and you know that's not at all like I said there's a really a pop masterpieces and that's extenuating his casual us about it yet or he's just being so rude face in the jar no nose of the face is it illegal just leave me alone now that's not the song So this one was just me trying throughout the week and my voice is a little raw now from screaming but you said who does George find the beginnings of a Georgia license perfect this is a quick one here is me in my apartment trying to think about how George Harrison's specific place works songwriters of The Beatles in the early days and I would sort of you know of some sort Nazar all and I was very lucky to get a couple of May sides before the band broke up you know but I really learned from John and Paul you know about Amanda Leighton sudden chords and progressions and things and then they eventually you know maybe people would say this student became the teacher shot you down that's too cheeky and props but he's your life while you're deciding what first of all everybody's gone my wife is gone there's nobody there meaning they've left you forever guy talking to himself in the dark but this is how you learn Impressions you listen to yourself then you do it again you listen to yourself so this ring I was not completely accurate single you know he's up there singing no reason we buy sit around the back I don't have no brothers traveling Methodist realize I go below calf of guy he came once when I was there I was not there and he came by and he said he and Lauren had been having a very nice evening of Coronet had I think it's Georgia had quite a bit to drink and he came into the writers when we were all stunned do you know George Harrison walked in and he was looking at us and he was weaving a little bit on his feet and he said sorry I'm a space that I'm as pissed as a newt and then we're like oh my God I need a sick why y'all staring at me and we were all staring at him and then there was that you know the piano that's in the writer and he started to play a more like shit Beatles playing on this piano and just then as a joke Al Franken came running out and slammed the piano shut and when I'm trying to work and then stop the whole thing even though and George got scared and laugh and I was like it was really funny to tell in Beetle to shut up with the music but yeah that happened to own a home don't you write I at least down here I have a home in Loudoun County I have a home in Marin County but I have a landlord down here in Los Angeles for the landlord's you live you live in a small apartment now and you pretend to do it be the Beatles all by yourself or in my car to your phone yeah if I took that challenge I just became really interested between the last time we saw each others like what does George sound like so I became very fascinated by that Rhythm you know by one time and I've had trouble with landlords I don't this time but my wife and I rented a place in Malibu on the beach and our landlord I guess was Eastern European I don't know where is from but we got a $30,000 deposit and then we we we leave in the house is perfect my wife kept it for me cuz I keep deposit. Fred need to be the been missing I keep deposit so then I had to get an attorney to sue him until we do all that and he's like okay you can have $30,000 not feeling good you got it. The problem was just completely culture cultural yeah it was just like you have to you can't blame a guy for trying. Should I eat normally I try to get if you get I'm not mad at you as you got the money hard feelings like these podcast what is gift in Love by giving me to talk about how do you fold the minute the minute you yes maybe you Lysol Winslow movie maybe I'll so much money are like for kids you can have it I don't want to fight it only of attorneys, Guy what's that guy's name laughing real hard over there what's going on this guy you know this guy don't you do you think you could potentially be someone that you know what are you trying to say you know this guy is Armenia a country he might have been Russian he might have been Bulgarian what's soda was laughing really really hard cuz he's literally I think that if they see an opportunity and they're like what I just hold on to it and then it shows a bit of a fight that I can never mind is a fascination with dialects does it beat a long time ago language across the planet's whoever was grunting in France at some point some cave guy started to evolve that French dialect Egypt Egypt so it's a culture that came from you keep EDD out looking the new liverpudlians are always very curious people cuz everything sounds like a question did you go to the store you don't sound sure I just told you that I love you sootheze. You can't sound humble with a French accent that you can so there's something called short on this is what it's like to strum Paddington from set timer for talking to a millennial hipster and they're sitting there eating an omelette they start bragging these are cage-free eggs eggs I always want to knock the pork pie hat off their head and say do you even know what cage-free means cage-free doesn't mean that the chicken who laid that egg lead a healthy happy life and Sara Lee you know cage-free is misleading cage-free eggs come from places where Hensley crammed indoors never go outside they're forced to watch Fox News Around the Clock angry chickens vital farm eggs on the other hand are pasture-raised and that's what it sounds like the reason to pasture they get fresh air Sunshine they don't have to watch cable news title farmhand treated the way hens should be they have access to at least a hundred and eight square feet of wide open pasture all day long I didn't have access to 180 ft all the time I lived in New York City than anyone on the East Coast they can roam Greys and you know what when they're happy you can taste it in the egg the egg you bite into the egg and it's almost like the egg says to I had lots of space and son you can hear it sometimes so the next time some hipster some Millennial comes up and goes this is a cage free egg man say hey back off Giacomo that doesn't get the job done vital Farms pasture-raised so stop being like some chop and start cracking in the vital Farms pasture-raised eggs every time you crack the egg you here I was happy at the grocery store and visit vital Farms.
