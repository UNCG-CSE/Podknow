Com doing an hour a day she'll Monday through Friday gambling show you know about it at the Fox Sports Radio Network so here we go first of all my blazing 5 let's blaze it up it's Colin's blazing 5 Seahawks and Steelers I'm going to take the Steelers - 3 and 1/2 I have a rule when you're a confident team and you are humiliated on national TV Sunday night Monday night you will rebound very quickly Pittsburgh was humiliated Bell played right there at home or there a better team felt so Brady he's eating Pittsburgh July Seattle gave up 418 yards to Andy Dalton Andy Dalton and one of the worst offensive lines in football 8 Seattle live at AJ Green and Seattle's offense only at 230 yards against the defense that was last in the league Seattle is Young they are a work in progress I'm going to take the Steelers here swallow the points 2821 bills at Giants I got to tell you buffaloes coaching staff is fantastic it's very rare in the NFL when you have a great coaching staff in a losing record they are rebuilding okay I think New York Pat Shurmur is a great coordinator I don't think he's a good head coach me what was New York's defense last week that was embarrassing the bills defense held the Jets to 3.4 yards that's with Le'Veon Bell that's with an improved offensive line that's on the road that was number one in the NFL okay that beat the Bears the Packers in the Ravens defense has John Brown 123 receiving yards in week one I got to tell you are we sure that Eli I know he's not better than Josh Allen athletically are we sure he lies better than Josh Allen right now by the way yes it's a road game for Buffalo for the going back to the same stadium I'm going to swallow the two points here and I'm going to take Buffalo to win a28 223 bears at Broncos now I'm taking points I'm going to take Denver + 2 and 1/2 Vic fangio Denver head coach last couple years was Chicago's defensive coordinator he faced Mitch trubisky every day at practice he knows what he can do and he knows what he can't do by-the-way Denver's got two great pass-rushers no sacks against Oakland they'll be spicy the Broncos have started Owen to since 1999 longest streak Malik they are 51/8 + 2 + September + home game since 1970 they won 17 of 18 home openers and by the way Mitch trubisky we know he struggles on the road it is worse eight touchdowns nine pics in his lap Broncos by the way have 120 straight week 2 home games trubisky you struggle with him at home worse on the road in his career I'm going to take the points Broncos will be upset 2420 Saints and rats this numbers come down now I really like it it's it's Rams - 2 and 1/2 at some places it's Rams mine is to like it I love it first of all New Orleans their reputation is amazing for do you know they're old and six against the spread their last six games betters are betting them like they're the Saints from week 3 last year their last six seven games they are not the same football team and DeShaun Watson 8 a.m. a live by the way last year the Saints lost of the Rams at home without Cooper kupp and really without Todd Gurley they're both back and Jared Goff is a different quarterback at home he is more comfortable last year 342 yards a game at home 7 and 122 touchdowns in two or three pecks I like this number here I'm bettin the number here I think it could be a very competitive game but mine is 2 - 2 Rams win 3126 Eagles at Falcons might take more points here now I like Philadelphia a lot but they're not going to know and I think they're vulnerable here I'm going to take Atlanta at home plus to first of all Matt Ryan last year at home and I think they've upgraded offensive coordinator was special matcha Better Home quarterback than Road quarterback in mostar Jared Goff is there's no problem with that also Malik Jackson a very good defensive lineman for the Eagles out for the year here's what's interesting I love Carson Wentz he has struggled away from Philly he's a 8 and 12 on the road his completion percentage plummets and his passer ratings in the mid-80s again Philadelphia's the better team but Atlanta was humiliated Week 1 home opener in the dome Malik Jackson out I'm going to take the up set here Falcons win 2724 all of our odds provided by Fox pet winning week last week we were three and two let's go this week let's start with this one and I've gone back and forth on this but I get Denver plus one now it's it's bizarre but they have a week's one and two maybe it's because teams are not in shape but weeks 1 and 2 Denver is virtually unbeatable at home since the merger I do worry about a short week but I'm going to go Denver + 1 I don't trust trubisky what are the Wise Guys think big agreement here Denver extra-sharp play in NY sharp while Denver lost so in front of the world on Monday night oh my gosh the Raiders beat them and now everyone's going to be down on a bear yeah they got be but there are the Bears they had a good year but you mentioned it let's get specific on the numbers last 30 Seasons first 2 weeks of the year at home Denver straight-up 33 and 3 years they were unsettled at quarterback that's incredible and no doubt and if you just go get against the spread which is going to count for all factors 22113 push it so 66% in those game now you're right a little concerned with the time to prepare yeah it's early in the year and by the way I think the rationale of that amazing streak early in the season for Denver is about conditioning when you have the game conditioning not yet quite there and then you add in Denver's used to the altitude I think your opponent really suffered I mean 33 and 3 is hard to explain here's the big thing is fangio knows trubisky that's the thing the more limitations a quarterback has the more that inside or knowledge can hurt the quarterback I think it's a big big factor big agreement on Denver take the Falcons plus one and a half at home that here's the thing I like Philadelphia a lot but I will say this Matt Ryan as a home quarterback these dumb quarterbacks you just see it RJ through the history of time Drew Brees at home on Matt Ryan at home so even though I think Philadelphia could be a Super Bowl 1 week a Superbowl Team how to get Lana was embarrassed in week 1 home opener Maddie Ryan at home is fantastic and the Eagles had a big loss defensively I'm going to take Atlanta + 1 and 1/2 what are the Wiseguys thing slight agreement and it's kind of a I'm taking a lesser of the two evils here okay now Matt Ryan I think I was off to Mystic coming into the season 1 I thought I didn't cut her I don't see is a big upgrade and I also really like Ryan played a lot in the preseason more than of any veteran really as a starter and I'm thinking okay getting the wraps in with Carter and then against Minnesota so many turnovers and it's one thing to have turnovers across the game those are almost impossible to overcome but if you have a bunch of early it get you out of your game and that you're down 28 nothing or whatever it is I a big deficit now you can't really execute your game plan so it wait I think you got excused Atlanta cuz turnovers have a lot of luck to him but on the other hand I look at this and I think Billy has Atlanta's number last three times they play and again you might say 3 is not enough maybe but when you have the same quarterback same coach on each side it tells you something 3 know Straight Up 3 and I'm against the spread for the Eagles and it lands only scored 12 points per game in those matchups you mentioned Malik Jackson biggest offseason acquisition out for the season so I think that hurts him on the field and also hurts them so psychologically they lost such a big player so all that said I agree with you but I there's just something about this Atlanta team I'm pessimistic about what we are getting pointed home so agreement Falcons an American Saga is inspired by the Wu-Tang manual and based on the true story of the Wu-Tang Clan chattan early 90s New York at the house the crack cocaine epidemic the show tracks of Clans formation of vision of Bobby Diggs aka the Riza who United the mentor between music and crime but eventually rise and become the unlikeliest of American success stories the show Stars Ashton Sanders as the Riza as well as rap is Dave East play Method Man and Joey Badass play inspectah Deck Wu-Tang Clan in American Saga is now streaming with new episodes every Wednesday only on Hulu Okay now I tend to take underdogs you know that I like underdogs now I'm going to go three favorites this is out of my comfort zone let's start with this bill's - 2 and 1/2 at the Giants I said this multiple times in the offseason and I believe this I think the bills are the rare combination of great coaching staff that has a bad record I think Buffalo attic players get better I think their defense is outstanding I think their secondary is top-notch and I'm not sure Pat Shurmur is anything more than a real good coordinator I feel like buffaloes defense will control the Giants offense and I just if it was 3 I probably passed its -2 1/2 Buffalo I'm going to go with it what are the Wise Guys think disagreement here and let's be candid you were going to be with the majority of the batter's I'm always fearful that right that the $20 batteries are not winning long-term you know they're on the bills why cuz they saw the giant Mason oh my gosh they are so bad and it's like okay no NFL team is as bad as the Giants team in the volume to do is fade in week 2 against those bad performances where you're saying that that that you you are fading the perception that it was so bad by playing the team that was so bad and it's think about this line for a minute cuz this is all about numbers and you know there's the old saying in vague you don't bad teams you better not right now home to home if we flip this if it's game-worn Buffalo it would be about a six-point flip now for the listeners that's important to always remember when you have a short road favor they always look juicy why because they're the better team you're thinking old they just got to win the game you know that's the kind of square way to think about it well if this came in Buffalo the line would be eight and a half for a 4-2 and a half at 6.8 and 1/2 know what was the line Giants at Dallas last would you remember seven or seven-and-a-half so you're telling me now Buffalo is a better team than Dallas because effectively now you're right and in the end that's the thing I get it you have to downgrade the Giants a little bit you upgrade Dallas a little bit or maybe more but even with those adjustments the idea of the bills and the Cowboys being in the same universe doesn't make sense and really effectively that's what this line is saying disagreement value giant so it's not easy to bet the Giants okay so I got a grievance Falcons and Broncos disagreement bills account to go for another favorite I'm going to take the Steelers - for fertilizing Pittsburgh is the better team and I think after being humiliated I've had a rule forever as a sports better when a team that I think has Elite components is humiliated on national TV they are extra spicy the following week these are professionals Seattle's not a great team they they found out a way to win their traveling East Coast they have not under Pete Carroll been great out east I'm going to take Pittsburgh the cover at -4 here this is a lot of points one of the Wise Guys think Nevis I only do about three or four times a year Vegas agrees I disagree so but what I'm saying is that as a Steeler fan I have you know inside or know any good I think here's what I think I think the big been more than any of these agent quarterbacks is going to hit the wall first he's taking so many hits yeah he's a lumbering quarterback like Cam Newton what I'm saying is to some degree Big Ben to me is the toughest quarterback I've seen since Bradshaw and I don't mean just as a Steeler quarterback I mean he's taking hits and I thought he might be for the year he's back in 10 minutes I mean I really respect that but they take a toll also the o-line which is become a strength of the Steelers getting older think about Pouncey now hit his 10th year and they lost their o-line coach Munchak in my opinion the best o-line coach in football so I also going to ask you the question Juju is the number to receiver okay what is the number one without a real number two that's a different breed a receiver the NBA number one I don't know yet if he can be that I'm skeptical and also certainly The Playmakers or are atrocious relative how do you lose levy on Bell how do you lose Brown and whatever Shenanigans or legal issues Brown has he's he he was has been one of the best receivers the last 10 years in the NFL there's just no question about it how do you lose those got and it doesn't seem like anyone really adjusted for it you think about the Patriots team this is a Patriots team some think is the best team in 10 years that they've had we can debate that but a really good team they were only laying five and a half against the Steelers remember two years ago Patriots house and Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship Game the line was like 6 and 1/2 in that game so I'm kind of confused how Pittsburgh's gotten closer to the Patriot there just seems to be a disregard for everything Pittsburgh's loss I think it's a mistake one sing Tomlin and the steagles remember that whiskey commercial with a fat guy was walking on the beach and had the bikini briefs on yes yes that's a guy that has like an extra defense against shame the Steelers are like that where if they lose a game to any other team is going to be ashamed of they just shrug and it takes losing two or three of those it seems to get Pittsburgh motivated so to me I think the wise guy I know the Wise Guys are on the Steelers I don't like it okay if finally were too and to I'm going to take the Rams -3 here's why Saints played late Monday Night Football now they travel all the way west Jared Goff last two years has been Rusty and week one because McVeigh won't play him in the preseason but in the second part of that game and I think this week going forward I think Golf and the offense start clicking girly clearly I at least at this point in the season you can depend on him to some level and the Saints to me I thought they were a little bit of Fools Gold last year at the end of the year for the bed forget the car that ran for the better team and they beat them I think the Rams or the better team now Cooper kupp girl he's back and they beat them essentially last year in New Orleans without those two guys so I'm going to take the Rams another favorite - 3 what are the Wise Guys think so I know you lock your picks in early so the line is down to two as we speak so at 2 I love the Rams love them and Wise Guys I think it to would two or three you know obviously it's a tighter call now what I say is I think you touched on a few really keep point one is that golf not playing in the preseason really hurt at the beginning of last game now it is her him the year before when he they played the Raiders on Monday night you would call they only had 10 points or Rams at halftime so what I had his pick up on that box show 6 Eastern every weekday was under in a number of those quarterback games in the first half last week that didn't play much or at all in the preseason but in a way it makes the ramp look worse than they really are cuz they had that disadvantaged last week that you talked about Breeze I am actually a little more optimistic about him cuz I think what we saw at the end of last year was arm fatigue and we didn't know was it arm fatigue did you finally get old or an injury it might have been an injury but we saw on Monday night he look pretty good by the team that look great but he look pretty good mentioning the Saints last six seasons first two weeks of the season 2 and 9 straight up one and 10 against the spread in September and September that there are Trends coaching Trends oh my gosh. Like maybe maybe Sean Payton does not unveil the entire Playbook until mid-october or maybe who knows right but when you get these kind of numbers because to me as much as Valtrex Lobby in September he's excellent at week one usually a great coach you give them extra time right thing on Urban Meyer think I say Ben in college extra time is death if you have a great coach the other team but for whatever reason Brees and Peyton have not done it now you might say all the saints a pretty good on the road 7 won last year well in the prior six years at zero winning seasons on the road for the saint-14 has been mighty good for many of those years so to me it's all about the line being too Rams at home and one last thought everyone saying oh Revenge game for the Saints but don't you think the Rams went to prove that last year wasn't a fluke Max but I don't think there's any real motivation at agreement on the ramp today's technology makes a lot of things easier simply because everything is connected your cell phone is connected to your tablet your tablet is connected to your smart television other all connected to your Wi-Fi but it may only take one weak link and all these connections for criminals to get in that's why I Lifelock Identity Theft Protection ads the power of Norton Security while LifeLock uses proprietary technology to detect possible threats to your identity like your info on the dark web for sale Norton Security help protect up to five of your devices from online threats like ransomware there's a problem babe.

Com finally on the Saturday podcast we have a bonus pick and this week I just want you to teach me something and teach the audience something okay so I like the Browns - 2 1/2 against the Jets darnold has mono he's out the line jumps to six and a half so first of all tell me who you would take and what do you make of that line movement teach me in my audience something what would you Wise Guys think because I I stay away from this game now there's too many players I don't know if they're going to played Arnold's out so I just I'm out I'm out teach me all right well this is very important to understand if you're going to bat what is the value of quarterback now the starting point is that it's relative whereas the the old-time joke is how much was Joe Montana worth one of the great quarterbacks of all time low about a half point when Steve Young was his back up right so it's all relative now that the outlier the most extreme value we've ever seen for any player was Aaron Rodgers a couple years ago in his prime I personally think he's out of his Prime at this point but a couple years ago he was worried about 10 point it was a combination of how important passing had become in the NFL with how good he was with how bad is backup was so this adjustment and you can just for an estimate do the math so we would say Okay rounds were two and a half Point favorites now they're six and a half Matt says for now they're caveat is key numbers matter more in the NFL 3 and 7 for example the fact this line move through three you can make the case is more than four points of adjustment I find that to be crazy let's just look at the numbers quickly Sam darnold season listen don't take this personally, yes and 59% completions in his career is passer rating 78% or 78 okay 5970 Trevor Simeon 59% completion his passer rating 80 so I get it the case can be made all the trend line on darnold except how do you look last week I hear he did a couple of Gyro place where you look really good he can he can have an IT Factor but overall Buffalo stymied in late I mean listen when you have three turnovers Advantage they were + 3 the jet you win the game in the NFL 90% of the time so it is in a few Mungus win for the bills that they won that game so to me I think it's an auto play a wise guy play in my opinion on the Browns or I'm sorry on the Jets because I think the adjustment for Darnell being out is too much are guy fezzik who is Elite NFL guy thinks it's only to the last lesson I'll give you a call in is Remember by definition if you bet against the line you were saying the line is wrong so Wise Guys will sometimes disagree with the Vegas Market to oftentimes most the time to Vegas Market is right before you to win as a sports better you've got to know when the Vegas markets wrong I think the Vegas Target over adjusted for darnold absence RJ Bell pregame., thank you on this drive.
