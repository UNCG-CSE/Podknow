viewers were shocked Wednesday night when Joe Biden's eye filled with blood during CNN's permit change it's covered there by the we have another picture that's a rough so this comes from Washington Examiner from the climate Town Hall the former vice president's left eye appeared to have a blood vessel burst while he was participating in CNN's Town Hall on climate change some were concerns that it was another aneurysm I think he had a while back some dismissed it as just you know high allergy season though many pointed to an ill-timed Green Room prank from Bernie Sanders which seems as the [Music] one that seems like something a little harsh Jody just needs a break man he's an old guy he's gay but puzzles bursting while he's in a speaking of Burnie season break he did declare that if he was elected president he will eliminate medical debt throughout the country of course Sanders did not give any further details of his anticipated legislation works not including though how he plans for the canceled all medical debt it's about damn time I love the little Lord Fauntleroy haircut case you wondered that we were running this in a shoestring budget literally couldn't hire another actor or a replacement who's played last week apparently in a blonde wig so ha so I want to make sure I understand this yes plan correctly if if Bernie Sanders if he just cancels the debt wait so bill how would how would this work can we do that yeah sure we can do that but how how can we do what if we yeah how we go about doing it or just do a subsidies oh really yeah so if we use subsidies just like the taxpayer you mean yeah okay exactly correct yes that's turning to entertainment Wow after being delayed for over a year Woody Allen's latest film will finally be released oh that's good finally a win for Hollywood Jews I don't know why we studio switching back to politics why does he you know it requires a key card to end yeah I don't know how he gets it oh man somebody on the inside because he sells jailed percocet switching back to politics the mayor of Chicago told senator Ted Cruz to quote keep your name out of your mouth keep our name out of your mouth sir I should say this came after the senator used gun violence in Chicago as an example of how gun reform laws may not work keep our name out of your mouth kept out of the mayor's mouth even more so were the names of everyone shot in Chicago over the month of August so [Music] Wow that oh that almost looks bad when I'm dead no I'm not with him it's just wrong as catch yes that's a good one not that's good some dad and Chicago is the best example of gun control and how it works so we have to be able to talk about it yeah come on yeah it's amazing yeah we'll end up that in post this is it's a catchy song to help me get down songs it's catchy that's royalty-free so we can use it without the brave and beautiful list big gay Mexicans and thoughts coming after us right here's a happy story he's still you once beautiful and brave always beautiful and brave yes but I think he's fired from River Ridge Louisiana became the first from the state to win the Little League World Series and it worked their fathers finally love them so Kappa play now is like using a plus-size model to reinvent it we're gonna talk about they should know a little bit about here comes reinvented strand I'm so excited I've been invited this comes to the New York Post the company wants to be more inclusive Calvin Klein and is embracing a new trend of body positivity [Music] and for those of you it's so crazy that we have viewership that rivals networks yeah budget what in the world and great amount of state budget if we had budget to hire plus-sized models no if we could cover the insurance costs we would also have that ladies that the Billboard said I speak my truth in my Calvin's yeah hmm your truth is varicose spider veins okay and this is one thing too like it really we skipped so we just skipped ahead every single track on the album we're now on the b-side think about it like we didn't go from obviously I think most men are not attracted to rail-thin mom no well you see on the runway of overcorrected right but they didn't go from like like Kate Upton plus they didn't go for some women who might be a little bit bigger no they've gone for people who would like look at the chart of the BMI they would have to extend into the chart this is readily unhealthy the tons of fun people sorry and something something also that I wanted I always feel bad for bigger women out there and you let me know if you're a bigger woman because um Garrett wants to meet you I always feel bad ouch for a bigger women who like one of the perks of being a bigger woman is you know larger upended and they have like that they have the blue the blue vein you don't I mean like the blue vein going through now does anyone know what you don't know no don't tell us more for for larger women who have flat pissed you flat butts is that a thing it used to be you wanted a more curvy woman right you would go with a bigger woman but then when you see a woman who's big and also like from the side is like you get certain people just look like you know you have a lot of South Americans the Colombians Cubans they're very curvy and then you just go south of the border like mad Mexicans I mean no ya look like bumblebees it look like bumblebees a lot of little things look at all the greatest Mexican athletes fantastic athletes yeah but they still like they they don't look ripped look if you see Cain Velasquez was the Mexican heavyweight did he look the same as a lightweight champion and that they're always like current like they're fit but just smooth yeah look the guys in Bollywood movies and then you look that fit me then you go to some guy in Iceland and they're like 350 pounds with a six-pack yeah that's true I don't know the point I really don't know it's different cultures have different Union the point is we are the world finally this week the 25th annual Asian junior you know and cadet table tennis champions been watching it and we do want to I don't know I have no idea you think I'm joking but because the monitors really small orge and all Asians look alike also not like bumblebees though no no they just look like they're going to crawl down the stairs in a stop motion fashion yeah and then go I'm like ah I should have known this house was haunted little grudge boy oh I should have known better than to trust you little boy and but yeah table tennis champion we here by the light ladders but we'd like to expand our horizons or a lot of people don't know that we have sports betting pools it's more international right so we'd love to know who your pick like to mix it is to win for the 25th annual Asian junior and cadet table tennis championship is it you quanto polyak man finchy sin how about Chang huge M Lee Han man Choi chun-kit perhaps timing way Kim moon song or cow genjou also been cooped in John kicked at situ chin could it be that you favor PACU Kyung foul why to Pyong Hong Kong I don't know to be your interest at ladder with crowd or a desk router and I want to hear what you oh I forgot there's also there's also a leak hi Yi yang couch in and fool white you know no it's qu not jus it's a different thing Mel Gibson cut out I feel like every time he has the key every time and the PIMCO I mean I'm not even sure yeah we change it no he knows the new pin comes getting into them just hit with his nose like he's in the HP do you think with he sees like a big woman with the blue vein you think he calls her sugar blue veins probably so for people who actually remember his DUI report of his crime so bad call the officer sugar [Laughter] doesn't just commit a crime just going well past it put your ass up that's like hey hands at hands at ten and two right be careful no no move no no no no time the Jews plus Wars and you're definitely spending a night in the drunk tank what what what I do all right so let's get to this is this you know I there's been so much outrage over this I watched the special I encourage everybody to watch the new specialness legend sticks and stones is a special it's had the left in meltdown mode of it over the last week in case you've missed it you clicked on my face so that's a promo for his special which is now available on Netflix six and stones it has been controversial I think that Dave Chappelle talking about trans people it's not Dave Chappelle at his finest and he doesn't he's talking about hey did you know she she used to be a man yeah totally unbiased the people her at her just in case you know he's never pull the wool over the eyes on old Stephen you played so much spot the training you're good talk about a special called sticks and stones this is what's so funny it might as well just be called screw you if you write a negative review of this because you're offended you're taking the bait and they took the bait they take it couldn't resist well something else that I've noticed it's a lot easier and we'll get to the the Rotten Tomatoes the critics reviews and I wanna actually leave a review below because I'd like to see what you guys think because we're not all accredited reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes apparently you know they rejected us not long ago really no good reason well yeah I can see why I noticed though that there are a lot of written written reviews that you can see they're negative but not a lot of video review and the reason for it is they don't want to show clips because if they show the clip to tell you how offensive it is most people will see the clips and go with this funny [Laughter] so they can just write about me they don't want to keep it in the context I'm gonna be able to isolate the language and then scream bloody murder offensiveness ran say but definitely don't watch him to make up your own mind well he oppresses trans people who know the joke is you can never upset the alphabet people that's not a thing but they want to tell you he said that we should kill trans children no what are you saying they're quarterback well if you look at the run tomato score there's like six people on there yeah and they're all negative yeah out of all the people that review movies and TV shows and stand-up comedy where are they right cuz I think it's funny and they can't say it's funny the right we're gonna get lambasted even keep in mind by the way Dave Chappelle is explicitly anti Trump k-pro relatively speaking gun control Pro sometimes pro-choice kind of keeps you guessing he takes jabs at everybody in this special okay even a headline to protest against Trump's so cut the Muslim ban and I was on a Muslim ban but for the sake of trying to keep this short I'm going to say yeah will refer to it so then why the outrage basically it all boils down to the fact that Dave Chappelle jokes about trends genders yeah which should be fair game cancel and over hoops right away totally done and before we get started we have gotten started I should say before we continue before we get started like what have you been doing this whole time no intro you're on drugs no it's important to note there's a trend amongst a lot of the critics of Chappelle yeah like the Rotten Tomatoes one of the reviewers I think we have a screen Ian Thomas Malone transgender Amanda Carey at the Advocate transgender contra points who's embarrassed quote for Chappelle transit that's one he used to be a man yeah woman yeah now aa woman used to be though just because I wouldn't want it to cause any offense thank you yes so that might provide some insight and might give you some it's why the reviews are so negative but we're going to look a little more closely as to how they've covered it okay well one of the things that I love about it too like that obviously is a big deal but the abortion stuff where he talks about my money my choice and he says if yeah I'm wrong then maybe we're wrong I was like that was awesome it was fun yeah it was hilarious we can figure it all out together yes exactly what I think is about that joke and if you look at the founding fathers joke that he makes which should upset sort of conservatives right because it's great yeah there's not nearly the outrage and the writers from left so they've got perfect special as a litmus test because the abortion bit where he basically goes and he says that he's pro-abortion that he thinks a woman's right to choose and then he goes and says and I think I shouldn't have to support I can at least abandon him sorry spoiler alert I'm pretty sure using the joke and so the right doesn't get outraged because it's comedy over someone saying that they are pro-choice pro-abortion but the left gets outraged that he says you know what maybe we're all wrong this is why I think the special is so important what do you think it's hilarious or not I do think he handled this pretty brilliantly yeah yeah just seeing who gets upset so now a couple of things that they've done here this is something you see a lot the left they take comedy seriously right they've been reporting on this special I wouldn't even say as though it's an op-ed in a newspaper they've been covering it like it's a news article yeah in a newspaper look not even the op-ed section of Fox News I got even Hannity or Carlson they're acting like it's Shep Smith yeah just straight down the middle this is the first I mean that they're back checking the Babylon be now on Twitter right what's up in that world this is what well of course because they're so used to that sort of comedy that all their comedy that they get is mostly super hilarious what are you talking about I mean if you go from Samantha bee or Trevor Noah to this special you up is down he doesn't even have an accent this guy's black woman Transpo from this special these jokes are really obvious and something to Norton talks about and I think this is important to kind of keep in mind why is there no pass for comedians for some reason there used to be more of a pass for hip-hop artists a little bit less now except for a little no sex who came out as gay who could have possibly seen that one coming but they gave it a pass quite a bit you know something go out and sing about gang banging and jizan hoes and selling crack they didn't a problem with Ludacris or jay-z right it's about free speech but then comedians if they tell a joke it's meant to be taken entirely seriously whereas really it's the art form that is supposed to have the most amount of leeway and someone being facetious or sir like a jester absolutely it's the lat it should be the last safe haven for free speech in this country and yet it's not mocking white people you know he does and I don't want to go where the identitarian is do you like warzone okay because a white genocide no I think it's funny when a black man does the basic white guy yeah all of them do and none of us can show here's another thing that they claim they claim that Dave Chappelle is punching down right this is why they're so upset and this is really typical of the left because we've talked about this their worldview is predicated on idea of societal structure of classes of oppression and violent granting the automatic moral high-ground to whoever they view as the underdog that's why you support Palestine over Israel even though they kill children they target them deliberately that's where they support people the antiphon aoc raises money for an to fight even though they had weapons and they were attacking cops so they just see you if you're the underdog if you have less power than you must be inherently morally right so in this case they argue that Chappelle is a bully because he's punching down at transgenders and lest you think I make this up I hate that we have to do this clip from The Young Turks thing like you're doing it to be funny and to joke but a lot of yes we're saying similar things are not doing it for that reason right so this is all of a sudden like okay so if someone else is using it in a terrible way and they're using it to foment aid and to commit hate crimes or whatever we're gonna call them these days and now all of a sudden if you tell a joke about it you might as well be wearing it right that yeah any less relevant if I say I prefer grape kool-aid to blue kool-aid you know I'm a Crip okay and even do because at home and he goes I agree you know hold me respond to like wait wait wait wait a minute you said you breathe air like David Duke does Mike friggin raced I know I'm the only person landline in speed dial so this is what C or D is it is Dave Chappelle and especially in watching he clearly demonstrates that the lgbtq is he refers to his alphabet people they are in power right and he does any he under Kurds this with some very funny bits he talks about how he he wasn't allowed to say off on the Chappelle show and he realized he'd written an unwritten rule in Hollywood right again he talks about the Alpha people he's not punching down at all he's punching up this is what's important is there any case in point is there any more powerful you know this happiness because you have some legal documents at some point here is there any more powerful organization out there that you can think of outside of Google YouTube maybe maybe Facebook but they're up there right when we're talking about corporate overlords for some reason when it's convenient for the left they they often don't mention Google and YouTube but let's assume they're powerful let's say not number one because I don't want to use an extreme example to make a point I don't want to I don't want to get per Billy here don't do it because you might fact check me i actually amazon is worth more and if you shoot in from the hip I didn't realize we're gonna fact-check a joke here you go CEO of YouTube look at her cowering before the LGBTQA a IP alphabet community the decision that we made was very hurtful to the LGBTQ community really sorry about that I'm really personally very sorry and I it was not our intent and will speak to people from the LGBTQ community make sure that we're incorporating that going forward in terms of how we think I am truly truly sorry for the hurt that we caused a community I really do apologize for the for the hurt that we caused that's harder to watch the Maggie Gyllenhaal so correct them correct not exactly but she does a gross disservice to the International Clint Howard look-alike foundation I just want to make sure that you and will not speak for all of them very clear the world's most powerful big tech organizations shudder in fear at the mere thought of a video suggesting that hormone replacement therapy for six-year-olds could be unhealthy and that it might be found to be trending that's what she's talking about she's talking about this channel by the way and this is the entire purpose of comedy I think a lot of people missed this the whole purpose of comedy as an art form is to speak truth to power is to poke your poke your finger like your rahm emanuel in the shower in the chest of the person who has authority the court jester was the only person allowed to mock the king at all yeah yeah that's what it's designed to do that's what Dave Chapelle was doing and then these same people out there say well listen how dare you bully I think you're the bully silence exactly right since the 1970s or 80s or 90s when the the LGBT community kind of started their movement or even kind of progressed further every single company start I know not start progressed they were lying dormant stop it every single like a separation in the United States right now would bow down if this community went after them they would they would issue an apology like that this organization has more power than almost any other organization in this country right absolutely and and one of the just extent on that like one of the one of the questions you asked is where's the power let's go back to who the reviewers were right right no one else no one else has the power to be able to put words on a public website like Rotten Tomatoes except for these few who have decided that they are going to vilify the jokes that Dave Chappelle saying and they're not willing to say that yeah you know actually he's punching at everybody Ron they only want to focus on the path of the fact that they're punching it their particular brand of authoritarianism which is in fact really proving that right well he's a black Muslim keep in mind he's a black Muslim and he made funny things trend he thinks the LGBTQ it's kind of weird let's be honest a lot of us do it doesn't mean that we hate anybody but he thinks it's a little bit odd that's what he talks about that's his greatest crime here a Black Muslim comedian who's largely shaped black American culture for our generation he's effectively this generations Eddie Murphy right it would be tough to argue against that he just made fun of people who chopped off their cocks that's not a stretch didn't say he hated them he said that's kind of funny all right let's bring butch notification Bell hit it if you're subscribed because apparently subscriptions don't mean anything or just bookmark the page you can check back every single day that's the join up Mugler blood of Kuran slash mclubbe you get dave rubin now he's going to be here at the blaze when the show launches we will give you the exact it's pretty soon I don't know the exact date yeah here's another thing that they claimed to the left and handling.this and I want to see if you disagree with any that we're talking about here because I understand this is a little more nuanced I hate using that word but it is here they're also saying the left are saying that because Chappelle said these things in this special it must mean that canceled culture is just a figment of your imagination it feels like a lot of comedians reach that point all they want to talk about is the stuff that they're not allowed to talk about that they always talk about yes yes they're not allowed to even though they did all nine it's almost as though that's a comedian's job Bruce it seems to me by the way he's straight it seems to me that Lenny Bruce choose wants to go up stage and like Point shine a light on societal taboos exactly this dealer makes the point it actually comedians are like the last line of defense and so if they're talking about this saying we can't say certain things that tells you that the the culture has gone this is important to note is is yes ship helpful because he's already extremely famous but as he points out in his special famous people aren't immune it's easier for them but look at Kevin Hart Kevin Hart was banned I'm hosting the Oscars because he effectively tweeted a gay joke now if he's not actually Kevin Hart you know what happens he's not banned from the Oscars he's banned from speaking at clubs from performing at comedy clubs he's banned from speaking at colleges so they have a little bit more leeway but they're not completely immune and by the way famous people they have their reputations destroyed for far less so here's something else to to keep in mind Chappelle his clip from Netflix or he's talking about Jesse small a Jesse small spoiler alert for BBC malaise it was trending number two on YouTube with um bleep you use the word and the enemy say the n-word he would say the n-word Allah so he said so repeatedly he said in this and it was unbelief and I can't even say you wanna see just you're hearing the baby I'm saying the actual word so he said and is gonna be a summit there's gonna be a march you know I don't want to say the word I'll be at the front that March just a quarter of you though yo the least defended if you repeated Dave Chappelle's bit - Dave Chappelle and use the words that he used now keep in mind so he was allowed to make those comments because he's famous there's so many way our channel was nearly banded just for having the word figs on a shirt just for being suggestively it actually didn't say figs it had a picture of figs yes yes so that was clearly meant that it was a different word yeah we wanted to let people know that it was that fruit also something like if we didn't have that people might confuse it for a date ooh that's true most people don't know they're figs from their dates so hey if you need more evidence by the canceled culture is real contra points the transgender used to be a man by the way right there you just watch a bashing Chapelle on the intercept not anymore my friend to make sure you get it right not anymore France from one I need to review can we go back it's an easy mistake to make good one at first glance but surely a woman now so counterpoints contra points was canceled yesterday for not being woken up for trans twitter was it can run against c disease a cow yes but there's still look there's still this lasting damage from people like this who are out there screaming at people like Dave Chappelle dancing you can't joke about this and it was a hilarious bit like the card like you don't want them to drive Vic that was hilarious the only thing was so funny again the whole thing it was it was a double dog dare you to do what you're doing and you're doing it you're going he thinks we're not oh is this reverse psychology he said this we're not gonna well we're gonna do it we're gonna we're gonna go right we'll be right where he wants us yeah you know all the other alpha and you know all the letters in the alphabet we're laughing and saying that's exactly right it is remarkable to me this was also something to um left us they're convinced that um Chappelle this is the argument they finally Hughes in case you didn't agree is it he's just out of touch with the current audience it seems like he thinks like this guy knows everyone feels the way he feels but they won't say it right so I just don't think that that's the case the problem is he thinks that those people laughing in that big room are still how the entire world is a comment crate if they're feeling to really listen to their own audience woman what he's basically saying is he thinks that everybody in this theater laughing thinks that's funny and he's wrong or somehow noted I think the other alternative interpretation is that they're saying that every person in the world who thinks this is funny somehow made it into the theater right no one else in the entire world a single thing to laugh right corn was shuttling them in for votes right dave chappelle towards the country and I bet people still laugh in other places I would imagine so just travel with him many people he's out of touch yeah I guess he's out of touch though if you look at the Rotten Tomatoes critic score versus the audience 99 percent from the audience waiting for them to remove the audience score so this is reliable yeah he is showing that the left is demonstrably out of touch so you could contrast that with Hannah Gatsby's terribly unfunny Nannette special it's got a hundred percent on Rotten Tomatoes seriously from the critics panned by the public only 40 percent do you see that's where she goes there's nothing funny about self-deprecation self-deprecation is self-humiliation you're a fat lesbian Australian self-humiliation is the only card you have to play that's all you got lady don't take it away a mini card I say this humiliation is largely the only card I have to play is she new zealand i have no idea austrian lady together well you know the idea or we're gonna go ahead and say oh yeah it's fine we're gonna we're gonna lumping this idea of what you decide is funny and if i don't think it's funny that no one should think it's funny and if you think it's funny you're a racist yeah I mean how many I mean could you imagine if a conservative was to go to a Black Muslim comedian and say you are a racist they would the the left would go nuts well this is what they did with conservatives they would say you were racist right if you didn't vote for Barack Obama so now they're having Black Muslim comedian who is married to an Asian woman by the way and they can't say but now he has done exactly what conservatives have done he's not conservative he's a liberal dip chiffon I'm not using the word leftist because I think he's one of the few people who is deserving of the title liberal he's more classically liberal you can be pro-gun control and still not be a part of the anti free speech outrage mob and I think that's Dave Chappelle so remember that next time he does something that you disagree with conservatives don't doggie pile on them or try and get him banned just say I didn't agree with this one I didn't like the special break and move on but um this is important first off the the videos on Netflix their YouTube millions of plays usually they're getting about 25,000 play it was very very her video but they couldn't silence him calling him a racist because he's black but he did the same in the Conservatives did and then he went off the reservation and he expressed an opinion that they don't like so they go home something we have to use the same tactic that we use against conservatives to silence them we can't say racist I know black people can still be transphobic transphobic yeah that's what they do it's the same exact technique they're just going to keep going down the list and that's why peas and crocodiles is fetal but Nanette from Hannah got to be a hundred percent you know what else while we're talking about Adam touch knock down the house a hundred percent from critics twenty five percent from the audience so I have to by the way Nanette had a gas three hundred percent and knock down the house when two percent I to do research as to what else had gotten 100 percent rotten tomatoes yes there are not many no no I mean usually you would you know there'd be some semblance of condi was excreted what do you want what do you want to watch tonight Citizen Kane or knock down the house Schindler's List the same 101 one hundred percent one percent if you just wanted to see he was out of touch with the general oh my gosh but does anybody really care about the critics scores anymore this isn't a genuine question because you've got like the public scores to be able to look at what people rate products online what they rate movies what they rate whatever right do people really even care anymore like Vietnam they are the most useless people in the world right now I can look I can look at what thirty thousand people think and get a really good idea or seven transgender people that rate this well then I think I'm gonna take the twenty five thousand people right migrate for was was eighty reviewers certified reviewers and it got a hundred percent and then the audience score was like a thousand five hundred odd Ian scores and it was twenty five so right yeah but if none of this works saying that he's a bully saying that he's transphobic saying that he's punching down saying is that up touch what do they did this is what the left always does with comedians they just claim you guess it that he's on front he doesn't he's talking about he's kind of stuck at this very basic level that he can't get past and it's in alright he could just not do the trans jokes because he obviously hasn't don't joke about eating very incisive to say about it and so it's it's actually I was sort of embarrassed for him watching him nothing incisive to say Wow just you know we oh the news commentary was missing from your comedy neck like special do you mean that he just I he just needed to know that he shouldn't joke about your thing right used to be mad woman now so just make sure we're clear I mean it would be fine if he just didn't do the trans jokes oh yeah and by the way don't make the trans amputee jokes and then you have somebody else going and don't make the trans Aegeus jokes because I believe that I'm a six year old girl named Stephanie who screws harley-davidson riders and everyone says don't make jokes about me then you have Hannah cats be saying don't make jokes about lesbian fat Australians who refuse to do comedy and call it a comedy special I mean at what point you just just just admit you don't like it and move on I'm embarrassed for him oh well I'm sure let's get Dave Chappelle on my landline with the speed dial one of the most prolific comedic minds of our generation all of a sudden this is something it's important to note all of a sudden they did it with Dennis Miller became unfunny overnight right no I didn't claim it's embarrassing they do the same thing with more MacDonald Greg Norman Donald Dennis Miller they did it at one point with Bill burr when they thought he was getting problematic and now they're doing it with Dave Chappelle how did he become so unfunny so quickly yeah he's like Jesus where he touches mic and he's losing his powers well I think it's obvious because you know he's not selling out any of the locations multiple nights in every city across the entire country many of which in black neighborhood yeah I mean clearly no one is going it's it's obvious that this is a zero percent rating when people go to the live show yeah well I mean this is funny I feel like with comedy I'm kind of the average Joe right I can laugh at funny stuff on anyway spectrum thank you very much you can shut up this is funny for everybody right he makes fun of the white method zombies at the end I thought that was hilarious as well like if you don't laugh at this if you can't laugh at some of the stupidity that we see in the country right now and have a comedian making these points that are actually pre intelligent points that he's making right and making them funny if you can't look at that and go that is pretty good you just don't know how to laugh I will say this and I think this is a pretty important I don't want to say important observation or something like chanc which by the way it makes me really said I know I know Young Turks clips right and we can't run them anymore once we pass them in subscribers we're gonna have to livestream when we pass you understand so much less money but I feel like we'd be bullying punching again do you guys think that let me know subscribed or should we ever make fun of them I don't think it's yes I don't want to be a bully nope okay I don't want to be a Dave Chappelle oh I don't want to be a Black Muslim but they do this they've done this with Dave Chappelle and they've done it with with us on this show what they try to do when they say this person isn't funny they separate the actual joke from what offends them right they did this with when they go well what Stephen Stephen credit claims it's jokes but I don't think that calling someone a lisp speak a Mexican is a joke well that wasn't the joke that's what offended you the joke was go watch the apology video that's 20 minutes long of jokes that's not the joke look with Dave Chappelle the joke about people driving the games driving the car and trans people making the ride feel like it's way longer than it needs to be that's the joke you were offended by the fact that he made fun of transgender so they say well I don't see the joke in making fun of transgenders that's not the joke you're separating what offended you from what the actual joke was and that's why they don't want to run the clips and here's a general rule that I use when it applies anything jokes are commentary right if you extend the clip that you see that typically generates outrage extend it 30 seconds in either direction it'll usually go one of two directions if you extend it it's either less offensive or you understand the point to it or it gets worse for example don't do that joke about Christine Blasi Ford yeah the authorities still what are considered distinct possibility that she's a lying whore was the joke yeah yeah well the Young Turks I hate you know we can't use them anymore once we go to surpass them but that last ship is gonna be a lot of fun um when people extended it 30 seconds in either direction what they saw was that we use all of the evidence as the setup and the punch line was a police officer and people said oh you know what I don't even necessarily but it's it's really not as offensive as you make it seem now if you extend it for example someone saying that I don't know I like seeing American war heroes getting killed in Iraq and we deserved 9/11 you go oh what's that that sounds that and you extend it and it's just I'm going seriously effing think we deserve yeah 9/11 seriously I hope this guy gets taken out by jihadists and you get a will that I excite provided more context it's almost like it's worse that's a rule that I use separate what offends you from the actual context and content of the joke and then whatever it is that offends you give it more context give it 30 seconds and eat in both directions and then if at that point you're not sure give it a minute in both directions it's usually pretty easy to find out where they're coming from and there is nothing sadder than while we're talking about this then watching woek leftist explain comedy to one of the greatest comics of our time I think that's what bothers me about this so much right now is this this this more discern izing this red I hate to use the word virtue signaling we do have to get to John O'Hurley a little bit J Peterman let's assume though that the left is being genuine I always typically assume that they're being genuine let's assume that everyone is actually offended and genuinely hurt by these jokes okay here how about this you don't have to find it funny you just have to acknowledge that it's comedy let's start with that start with that context over content and then maybe we can find some common ground otherwise it's just point-scoring don't have to find it funny just admit that it's comedy all right John O'Hurley J Peterman coming up right after this we have to go Mel's not around at least I think it's time to go I hope you're gonna come with me from the network that brings you louder with growl people I truly admire and respect comes a man who goes by many names straight white supremacist neo Nazi alright racist sexist homophobic Jesus Voldemort Optimus Prime kylo Ren Falkor secretly a conservative who also happens to be gay you see what just happened there I just played some identity politics in my the Rubin report is coming to blaze TV we're trying to talk about Big Ideas in an honest open way that's it yes that is it subscribe to blaze TV through mug club today where not only do you get this show but apparently you get dave rubin now too so that's cool [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] hello my name is Teresa and I am a lesbian did you know that lesbian couples face many of the same problems that also plague straight couples this ranges from petty family squabbles all the way to domestic violence in fact the Peconic crimes occur at even higher rates and straight couples living in rural areas according to research almost 44 percent of lesbian couples experience domestic violence compared to 35% of straight women 26 for gays not to be a debbie downer or anything but I was actually slapped by my girlfriend on the way here it's time we put an end to the senseless violence by providing shelter for victims and well carpeted rooms please donate at battered lesbians org and let's make sure that no more lessees take beatings from their partners you too can stop the abuse by giving generously and battered lesbians to org [Music] you [Music] now quarterblack what is he saying and I seen I see Zuzu doesn't make any sense it's from a TV show it's just sound it so who does he think he is Bob Dylan it makes no sense our next guest I'm absolutely thrilled to have him on the show you know I've talked about some guests that I've wanted for a long time and then some guests where I just go oh my gosh if we could get and get him great because one of our producers and now I'm gonna let the cat out of the bag you know Brendan he was back there he's looking at the monitor he goes wait is that J Peterman that's what I said I said yes and he said I said did you not look at the guest list so he's fired but it's flattering to our next guest because everyone knows who he is because that he's done so much obviously his that his show a man with standards is a solo show actually right now he's gonna be performing it Feinstein's at Vitello's Feinstein's at Vitello's I think September 20th 21st he can correct me if I'm wrong there you know him potentially as J Peterman and Seinfeld host of many different shows including Family Feud the national dog show which I want to talk them about I watched every single Thanksgiving he's what you call in the industry not a triple threat because he's more than a multi - it but mr. mr. John O'Hurley how are you sir well I'm great and I appreciate a wonderful introduction it doesn't seem to go far enough so continue if you'd like well I don't have much else to going now one thing else is you you don't mind you when people bring up J Peterman because you've you've done a lot but that's that's a role I think so many people will remember you from because it's one of the most beloved characters in all of television that I don't wake up and I pinch myself for the a the joy of performing that role on the time that I did and for everything that has followed ever since then it's I've lived a blessed life because of that I got to play in that championship team and a championship season that's a good way to look at it seems that we've talked about this quarterblack work Nia seems people who've done other things aside from one iconic role they don't have a problem with people bringing it we've had some performers in the show like don't bring that up I don't have people like team can you say sure about Superman because they've done others so once you're accomplished it seems like you're not bothered but we've had people go both ways but I'm also horrendously unlikable mr. Hurley you're on the program for a multitude of reasons but recently you spoke out this has been all over the news against the action specifically of some Will and Grace cast members Deb Debra Messing they were talking about I want to provide some context here Hollywood fundraiser for Donald Trump and then Debra Messing tweeted out let everyone know who's attending and this was seen as potentially kind of a modern-day blacklist and even making the rounds talking about this can you kind of explain for people who may not be familiar with it what your reasoning was for speaking out and in how you view the situation because it's lit the internet ablaze well I I have no I I can't reason why they would say something like that but it underscores the further problem in Hollywood is that for some reason Hollywood has a liberal mentality and I understand that but I don't what I don't understand is the lack of civility in that other alternative points of view can't be equally absorbed and and and entertained it's as though they've enjoyed the bully bully pulpit by using them by using the strength of their position in Hollywood to to kind of silence the the I wouldn't say just conservative thought I would say you know any type of libertine type of any anything alternative to the liberal way of thinking doesn't work in Hollywood and it's what is so sad is that I hear this on every set people will come up to me and say well I'm so glad that you're a vocal conservative because we're afraid to talk around here for free for fear of being let go right I said isn't that lawful yeah we live in that type that we are the freest most prosperous country in the world and yet are entering this one spot of other of this our human experience our entertainment has to be so sequestered into one style of thinking that's it right as though nothing else exists and and no one else can have an alternative I find that shameful now have you always been more right leaning more conservative or was this kind of a development because it certainly seems to many that you're more outspoken in a very civil way I want to be clear you're not going around throwing bombs but it seems that people are more aware of it now have you always been this way I'm sure I didn't quite understand the question you were have you always been more conservative versus more of a development throughout your life because you've been in the entertainment industry for a very very long time well I've always I think I've always been I've always been a conservative I just didn't understand what I was but the the principles I think that I've developed in my life I think paralleled the conservative thought and and I won't apologize for them they're well thought out they're well based and and I think they deserve a voice because I think I deserve a voice it's as simple as that and I also the other thing I feel is that I'm a little curious as to why this political tone is so important in Hollywood you know I'm one of these actors that subscribes to the Spencer Tracy School of Acting witches say your lines hit your marks and go home don't make a big thing about it you know I mean a celebrity is defined as someone who gets to do a lot of things that they have no business doing right and I just like to just do my work and go home and I don't lead with my politics I don't live by politics and you know oddly enough that's when I find that kind of distinguishes the conservative mind is that they tend to think of themselves as responsible for their own destiny in life and they don't require a government or a support group of any sort that they're more individualistic and so consequently they're tougher to find and there's certainly tougher to poll as we found out in the last election but I seem that seems to it to coincide with conservative thinking is that people just end up you know I just do my work and I go home and I don't make a big deal about it right it's it's tough to meddle effectively in people's lives who base their worldview on not having people metal you know all you have to do is all you have to look at the caller ID at 6:00 p.m. at night and you know you're not answering that phone call exactly well that's that's probably why I don't know how you frankly I don't know where you'd find him you're certainly not gonna reach him on the telephone that's a good point I don't know maybe email if you're Nigerian prince it seems to me those phishing emails yeah you answer those first because actually I have my investment attorney working on my retirement plan through some very very prosperous and high some potential Nigerian I don't want to push those because that's that's my right I understand not so much an attorney as it is just a hobo with a paper sack and a to a toothpaste that's that's mine he's I feel my retirement is in good hands I don't fully understand the difference we are a steward tax deferrable but he seemed like a friendly chap somebody just said that I find interesting you talked about Hollywood in the bully pulpit now they sort of predicate this this resistance idea and the idea of effectively not doxxing but releasing the list of people who might support Trump they predicate this on the idea that the bully pulpit is a president right the president United States is a Republican therefore they must be the underdog but you referred to Hollywood as the bully pulpit and I do see it that way I'm curious as to why do you believe that Hollywood maintains more power over the culture at large than say the president does Hollywood I'm sorry what do you believe that Hollywood exerts more power than say the president because you use the term bully pulpit and and I would agree with the sentiment that Hollywood has a greater bully pulpit then let's say President Trump and Twitter but they act as though they're the victims and conservatives are the bullies they they feel absolutely no reservation at openly and publicly shaming the President of the United States and I've never heard that before and I've never heard it so done with such you know as though yeah its we're all just members of the good-old-boy Club and our job is to insult the president as much as we possibly can there's just a visceral anger towards this man that that supersedes any sort of civility and and and I hate it I hate it we have no respect for the office of the President and and I'm ashamed of our industry and in the way that they portray themselves and the fact that they feel that they have permission to do it at the expense of Believe It or Not a very silent a silent population that feel differently but aren't allowed to speak up well I guarantee you that there's a lot of people at the Academy Awards that would love to have stood up and say you know boo yes just that way too boom that's how they would have said that would be somewhat pedestrian excuse me but I'm jutsu on that beat you know let me ask you this because obviously you know play for multiple seasons J Peterman on Seinfeld and that's really it was rated the number one show of all time until the wire supplanted it I don't know how that worked I don't maybe you have some friends no wire I don't know anyone who loves the wire I don't know what it is everyone always wants to say that you should love the wire but when that lists change and Seinfeld wasn't number one I was pissed anyway I'm it's no Seinfeld back then on that set because we know obviously that Larry David has been more of a liberal activist I wouldn't say liberal but he's talked about certain issues was the tension is palpable back then in the entertainment industry as today or do you think it's developed at a rapid rate i I think they have found I think the industry with with Trump's inauguration I think found that they just gave themselves permission to say whatever they wanted to I don't know that I I don't know that I saw it as much during the Obama administration but I do see definitely that there is a visceral hatred for this human being and it supersedes any any ability to absorb the good things and the promises that he's kept in his administration which is what I I don't have to love my president I don't have to love him but I do respect him and I do respect the things that he proceeded he would accomplish anything's that he has accomplished and I think he's and I think in face of all of the obstacles and the derision that he has to live through every day I don't know another human being that could do it or live with it I'd be off a bridge if I had to go through what he had to go through every single day but he has the mentality and the temperament to to end and the thickest skin I've ever seen on a human and human being and he's able to to function outside of it and I think he has the the good of the country at heart and again I like the things that he's accomplished because they were the things he said he would accomplish right and I think that's why a lot in Hollywood don't like him because he has accomplished the things that he said he would accomplish final question before we go to the web extended because I do want to pick your brain on dogs a little bit you've said that some people have come up to you and said thanks for saying this because we would like to speak out but we're afraid of losing our jobs have you had anyone come to you and with the with the opposite kind of sentiment you know poke their finger your chest and say hey buddy hey chief you better cut it out pal no I have never had anybody try to curtail or censor or edit anything that I that I say but then I think about what I say so I can't think you could find too much offensive about what I say what I do feel from people is that I am attacked we're feeling the way that I feel right to me and say well I used to like you but I no longer like you because of your politics it's those I leave with my politics well I'm not my circumstances I'm a human being my politics help basically organize the value and the structure of my life they are my relationship with my government but that's all they are they are my politics yeah well I would imagine that someone thinks of themselves a little more highly than they need to if they say hey hey mr. O'Hurley just so you know I used to like you you don't you don't know me by the way enjoy your lunch oh it's a great church or try the French toast you don't know me but I used to like you and I don't anymore checkmate all right we have to go to the web extended here talk a little bit more generally the the show is a man with standards fine scenes at Vitello's Los Angeles do I have this right it's

the whole blaze catalog you know yeah the only thing gayer than the play cats is actual cats I agree yeah but we really man I will say for a low budget we really have been making a go of it over that the prop Department you're welcome it was not a fit what are you eating chicken bro okay alright I'm gonna get him your desperately seeking affirmation for the black purple drink Trayvon wood or wood chip right you know in this segment I often you know often talk about ways kind of to improve oneself we talked about that quite a bit or paths or techniques and invariably it usually comes down to something like discipline and consistency sometimes gratitude but I wanted to talk about something today that isn't necessarily sexy may seem a little bit more existential more philosophical but I think it's equally important and for many of the same reasons so I don't know did you guys know about the Kevin O'Leary from Shark Tank the accident that he had no audio a heart an accident no no that was just cancelling the Oscars no Kevin O'Leary it was a crash he crashed into another boat at night and killed two people Wow yeah killed two people now I don't know all of the details but hard to get the details and this is kind of what would sort of provide us some inspiration for this segment because I was trying to get the straight answer on the story and I couldn't the initial story that I read said that their lights were off right it was at 11:00 at night so what we do know is that it was at 11 o'clock at night and the wife who was I think driving the boat passed a sobriety test there was no there was no under system from what I understand or certainly not above the legal limit and then I read that no the lights were of this other boat and it's a tragedy of course it's it's really sad I'm sure that Kevin O'Leary is really torn up about it ah then I read that kevin O'Leary and his wife fled the scene of the crime okay this was from one new source then I read another one that said the other people the remaining people on the other boat fled the scene of the crime and then it turned out that both of them had technically fled the scene of the crime but they both went to shore to immediately call for medical assistance and there were phone records for that and the reason I say this is because the reason I talk about this I bring it up is because I think sometimes we're always looking for someone or something to blame and sometimes there isn't somebody to blame this is a really unfortunate as best I can understand it and I know some things might develop here so don't hold me to this because I don't have the full story none of us do yet um it's an unfortunate accident it's really unfortunate aches could have been made certainly there could have been some carelessness involved we don't know it doesn't seem that way right now but no one's a villain here no one's a bad guy here and sometimes we're looking for answers and I know this is really unpopular to say we talked about this and Ash Wednesday this week for those for mud club members talking about the school shootings the mass shootings what we need to do with gun control you know what there aren't any answers necessarily are there some solutions that maybe people can come up with are these conversations that we can have absolutely to see how we can improve our current situation I think we should always be striving toward self improvement but the idea that we have answers right now that anyone has the immediate answer to solve the problem I've heard people say well we have we have more guns than anywhere else in this country and that's why we have the suicide problem oh okay so do we have the top suicide rate in the world no we don't we have more guns and we have more guns than Somalia per capita do we have worst violent crime in Somalia no we don't so what's the solution taking the guns out of the hands of people who aren't committing suicide in record rates by global standards we're taking the guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens who are not committing mass piracy as those in Somali there aren't necessarily any answers and we're often looking for a villain right we're looking some maybe someone who sold the guy the gun maybe we're looking for somebody or Dan Crenshaw with aoc who might have lent a friend a gun right how can you do this aoc said do you know that that your friends who are borrowing your gun are more than likely domestic abusers that was an actual tweet think about that more than likely most likely domestic abusers where'd you get that AOC and then we want to talk about common ground right well notice I can you just assume that this person's friends are all serial felons violent felons who beat their wives you're gonna find common ground after trying to vilify somebody what you really mean by common ground is you actually want someone to agree with you you just want to beat someone into submission whether it's Dave Chappelle whether it's Dan Crenshaw or myself and so what happens is they try to vilify somebody because they always look for someone to blame and we all do this by the way a lot of people act as oh we're super separated from politics we hear this without lis I just don't like the division in politics you think that only happens in politics have you ever been to a Thanksgiving dinner you can see have you ever been to a wedding you can see people line up on one side of the dance hall and then people line up on the other side of the dance hall this happened most recently to wedding I went to but that's they were easily recognizable because of her Mennonites but here's the thing we're always looking it's it's a reflection of our selves politics it's human nature and all human beings are looking for a villain they're looking for a boogeyman they're looking for a scapegoat sometimes that's not the case and it's an accident here's what I'm going to tell you because of that because we understand that because we understand the condition of human nature err on the side of forgiveness Noah's not sex now obviously I'm a Christian so I believe in forgiveness it's built it's built into the faith okay atheists out there tantric Yogi's stay with me anyway not only should you err on the side of forgiveness because it's right because you'll probably make fewer mistakes but it's also good for you it's better for you I can honestly say that right I can't think of a single person throughout the entirety of my life who I wouldn't forgive right now they asked for and I no less that sound like virtue signaling let me tell you some it's a real flaw of mine I find it really hard to forgive people who don't ask for it people who've wronged me or people who've hurt me if they were to apologize the easiest thing for me to do my instinct is to forgive I'm typically a pretty empathetic person but forgive someone who doesn't even want it forgive someone who doesn't even think they were wrong oh that's hard so which action is the right thing to do when you're in a scenario let's say the kevin o'leary snare to go back for it okay which action do you think would lead to more personal happiness fulfillment your own personal salvation then to spend the rest of their life looking for someone to blame in the face of a horrible tragedy it's completely natural and I'm not saying by the way that you just forgive and forget someone who actually beat your wife or or or raped your daughter of course not there still needs to be justice that's not what I'm saying I'm talking about forgiveness in the sense that we go through with our in our day-to-day lives and the hate that we and I don't mean hating it empty LGBTQ because I mean analphabet people joke but actual hate that we harbor in our heart toward our fellow man we ask you this why should you be disciplined we talk about that a lot why should you be principled why should you be consistent in your endeavors why should you be grateful because it's the right thing to do it will also improve your life immeasurably often they go hand in hand sometimes doing the right thing is really hard in the short term in the long term I tend to believe that will improve your life the same can be said for having a forgiving spirit do this think of someone right now think of someone who's pissed you off who's wrong you've been clinging to it you've been grinding your teeth you've been ruminating on it okay I want you to take a second here think of that person you got we all have them could even be here you're pre-kindergarten teacher I bleep it bleep that because I don't want her watching this but that's a story for another day all right have you got the person got him in mind now let it go forgive them and this isn't some kind of a new-age thing where I'm going to be playing by knurled Delta beats forgive them move on with your life move on to the discipline the consistency and taking all the other steps that we've talked about that we know and you know will lead you to a better life in a better self but you can't do that you can't take those steps to improving yourself unless you get past yourself and that starts not with forgiving yourself not with loving yourself as Calvin Klein wants you to wants you to believe in speaking your truth no no you don't get past yourself and you don't improve yourself by just focusing on yourself you get it through serving others and you know it starts with forgiving others try that tell me who doesn't improve your life I'll see you next week oh that's right next week debates [Music]
