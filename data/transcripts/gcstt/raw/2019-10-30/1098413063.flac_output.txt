Shared emotion that have an enormous effect on how well we doing business especially in this digital age when physical interactions between business owners and customers and amongst customers is an overlooked Dynamic one of the coolest ways that you can create a fan ocracy is what we call get closer than usual and this idea comes directly from neuroscience and we interviewed several different neuroscientists about what actually goes on in your brain when you become a fan of something and in particular what's happening is that when you're a fan of something you're with like-minded people

that is something that comes from our ancient brains so what that means is if you're with somebody who you really enjoy being with a really close friend or somebody who shares the same fandom as you do or the company that's creating this thing that you're a fan of very positive human emotions are happening in your brain but if you're close to people you don't trust like in a crowded elevator or a subway car something there's very negative emotions that happened and it turns out there's actually degrees of how close you get to someone that gauge this powerful human emotion about being close to people so the farthest away is 20 feet or further and that's called public space"], [0.9662066102027893, " and public space humans don't really track people we know they're there in the back of our minds but we don't really track them inside of 20 ft from about 4:50 to about 20 ft is called social space and in Social space our human brain we can't help it begins to track people and we track people because our brain wants to know is this person a friend or Foe or a possible mate and we can't help that human reaction so that's why when you walk into a room you begin to track the people in that room because you want to know are they friendly or they potentially dangerous and as soon as you see a friend in that room you have a very positive human emotion if you see someone that's you sense danger of it's a very negative emotion this means that as an organization wants to build fans the more you can put people in a room"], [0.9694027304649353, " couch are like-minded fandom or

and that's from about a foot and a half to four feet that's cocktail party distance and the cocktail party distance is the most powerful human emotion cuz it's even closer and so this concept of getting closer than usual and getting literally physically closer to people is an important concept around Phantom and you know it's interesting I've been to 15 business masteries as a presenter and

something sad you literally feel sad your brain is firing as if that is happening to you what this means for all of us is that we can use digital Communications we can use video and we can use photographs to crop an image as if we were actually physically close to people so we can create a video and crop that video as if we're in the personal space chapter 4 feet away from the audience
