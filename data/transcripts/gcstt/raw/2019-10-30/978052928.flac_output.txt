on how European cultures of the last Thousand Years approached divination'], [0.9445691704750061, ' but the practice shows up in so many other places as well the indigenous people of North America for

South American cultures in fact the name of the Aztec god tezcatlipoca literally translates into smoking mirror a reference to the use of polished obsidian as a scrying device which is interesting because the Englishmen John Dee who served as an advisor to Queen Elizabeth the first in the second half of the sixteenth Century dabbled in divination throughout much of his life and one of his key Tools in that process at least if the rumors about him are true was a small round hand mirror crafted of black obsidian whether or not it was actually used by him it's a tantalizing connection to the

Christ shows just how old this idea really is the wise men from the East as it said have long been thought to be Persian priests known as Magi according to historian Owen Davies most ancient writers like Pliny the Elder believe the magic itself and therefore divination was invented by this specific group of priests and the fact that the biblical wise men interpreted a celestial object and Then followed it across the Middle East certainly lines up with that idea'], [0.9493833184242249, ' but divination was about more than dreams and mirrors and looking intently at the night sky it was about

and this wasn't purely a Christian belief either according to historian Mitchell Roth for about 400 years beginning in 12:15 almost every single culture in the world included trial by ordeal in their legal system because in the face of you I known the help of the Gods was often needed"], [0.9579305052757263, ' the basic idea behind trial by ordeal is relatively simple if someone was murdered there

Justice'], [0.9706836938858032, " one type of trial by ordeal that was common in Europe was known as trial by fire of course you've probably use that phrase at one point in your life usually it's a hint at a trying or painful experience but in the Middle Ages its name was a lot more literal a trial by fire usually involve some variation of endurance in the presence of deadly heat sometimes the accused was required walk on burning coals while other times they had to dip their arm into scalding water to retrieve a stone it all depended on the culture you lived in and the local traditions of

method of divination for justice was known as trial by water just think of that classic Monty Python and the Holy Grail scene where they discuss dunking the accused witch a bit of Comedy that was

swallowing a piece of food and trial by being another connected to food this one involving a being that was poisonous trial by diving seem to be limited to India and Southern Asia and involve staying underwater long enough to be proven innocent but the most bizarre test as far as I'm concerned was known as trial by Blood"], [0.9620083570480347, " keep in mind in the case of murder there's a lot of emotion there's pain and lost as well as anger and confusion people want answers in the biggest question is usually about who the true killer was so trial by Blood serve the purpose by giving people a systematic way of discovering that person's identity"], [0.9598399996757507, " here's how it worked once the search for the true killer began the body of the victim was placed naked on a table or floor in a common space then the suspects will be led one by one to where it where they were instructed to circle the body three times then they would approach the body and touch the wound that had killed the victim if nothing happened they would be considered innocent and released from custody but if they're touch somehow caused the wound to produce fresh blood that was seen as a sign that they were guilty"], [0.9545221328735352, ' historians call the process cruentation from the Latin crew entire a which means to make bloody according to forensic psychiatrist Robert Britton this tradition
