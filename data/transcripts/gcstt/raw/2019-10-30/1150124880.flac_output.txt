Given the conversation we just had about feeling which is of you yell at me I feel small and vulnerable at risk and if I yell back I feel strong and powerful in and in control and so I'm going to do that as a gut reaction even though it might get me the exact opposite outcome that I'm trying to get to"

      " All Souls day with the Catholic Church added later on because they hadn't been completely successful in converting the Celts with November 1st and All Souls day is a little bit spooky to because it was a day that people would pray for the souls of their loved ones trapped in purgatory so the beginning of what we think of when we think of Halloween when did that start probably around the sixteenth Century that I think is the earliest references that I have found to it in terms of it being Halloween and not salad and the first few references that you can find to it or with parties people celebrating bobbing for apples was a ritual that was in there right from the beginning and then a little bit later on you get a lot of this sort of telling ghost stories in fortune-telling that kind of thing and when did the idea of trick or treat in the phrase trick or treating when did that all start"

      " oh I know this is funny because people think that trick or treat is very old I hear this misconception a lot that it goes back to ancient Celtic practices that The Druids dressed up no it really is less than 100 years old it began as an American custom it came about in the late 1930s because up until that point in America Halloween was being celebrated mainly by young boys who would go out and play pranks on that night and the prank should become so destructive by the 1930s that a lot of cities were considering Banning Halloween and fortunately some of them were smart enough to realize that they would have more success by buying off those prank players so they created this idea of parties in costuming and rewarding the kids with treats for not going out and committing those tricks and the idea of going door-to-door and saying trick or treat in expecting candy that came with"

      " we get the phrase trick-or-treat about 1927 and and it actually started in Canada but we don't get it combined with the whole you dress up in a costume you go from door-to-door until really look the late thirties and even then it took a while to get to spread all the way across the country it kind of got interrupted by World War II because of the Sugar Ray schening and they're just want a lot of that reach to hand out and then it really picks up and and goes full-throttle right after World War II and that's when you get the company's coming in and saying hey Mom you don't have to bake treats for these kids anymore here's pre-packaged candy and you don't have to make their costumes anymore here are pre-made costumes so I would imagine that Halloween was a big bun to do the candy industry oh yeah it was mainly in terms of candy candy corn which was invented around the turn of the last"

      " went insane and now Halloween is one of the biggest days of the year for beer consumption and the idea of dressing up in costumes and masks and things went when did that really take Hold Ya the whole idea of costumes kind of goes back again to when people had to buy off these destructive pranksters who were costing cities lot of money because they had moved into the cities they were breaking light fixtures they were starting fires and so the this was the height of the Great Depression people didn't have a lot of money to spend so they would get together and they would do these things called House to House parties and the idea was that each house would contribute something different to the overall party in the first house would usually give the kids a really simple costume it would be like a sheet over their head to be a ghost or maybe just even some suit smeared on their face give him an old coat they could be a hobo that kind of thing so that really is where the costuming part comes in"
