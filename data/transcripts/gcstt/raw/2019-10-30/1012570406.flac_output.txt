      " talks when were talking about making an impact in the whole world is that the overall number of people you impact the world it's it's the people you impact in your own part of the world and focusing on that not not being famous not having a worldwide platform but pouring into the people in front of you not overlooking people you don't like this person right in front of you is not less less worthy of your ability to impact them then somebody that you don't know over in Africa I'm sorry it's just reality so if your true about 1 impact people what you should be you should start your own backyard you should start in your own Community because if nothing else if you're really doing it to impact people you could do it more effectively if you're doing it because you want to make money you got to own your own territory the first place anyway either way it's what you should do and people are looking 10 steps down the road instead of focusing on all the opportunity right in front of them"
