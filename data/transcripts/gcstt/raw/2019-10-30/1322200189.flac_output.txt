he went on to say that basically back then any 80s murder was basically like chalked up to only being related to gangs or crack epidemic like bad things happened in bad neighborhoods and obviously we all know that bad things happen everywhere to everyone regardless of race or religion or economic status but this was kind of the attitude back then and this murder was rocking the community and especially Jennifer's close-knit community of friends they'd never known anyone who could hurt like this stuff like this again didn't happen to people like that they were young and Rich and carefree and youth often carries with it a sense of invincibility bad things happen to other people death is so far in the distant future and there's no reason to be afraid of it they were basically all these

vacation or they go out to the Hamptons for the weekend or to a country house somewhere and they would just leave their kids behind in the city with no supervision and it's just not a big deal to them but like I said Jessica didn't grow up like them this wasn't her normal though she did really Embrace this after her parents divorce and she moved in with her dad and Soho Jessica and Peter and her Prep School classmates were kind of her get away into a new scene all of its new and cool and like adult right like it's very grown-up thing to have all this freedom and this whole crowd makes the

were having a great time but we were not okay and quote"], [0.9674617052078247, " so did you go back to police like piecing together her night Alex gives a bunch of names to the police about who all was at dorian's that night and police go talk to those people to get more names and start building a timeline of who was there at what times who left early who sale a who left with who and as they

has scratches"], [0.9718498587608337, ' on his face like fresh deep scratches he also has a weird hand injury which the lie detective recognizes as being common among boxers who like hit wrong now initially Roberts like super polite super cooperative and he even volunteers to go to the police station so that they can talk there at the precinct when they go to the station they begin their formal taped interview and police ask Robert about the scratches on his face and he actually jokes about it and lifts up his shirt to show them matching scratches on his chest and he says that all of these scratches like face and chest are from his cat and police are like'], [0.9791085720062256, " okay well then let me ask you about a specific friend of yours when is the last time you saw Jennifer Lovett now Robert tells the police that yes I was at dorian's I saw her there the last time that I saw her was like right outside of dorian's but we said goodbye kind of went our separate ways and I didn't see her again now the whole time that they're talkin Robert is Uber like not nervous like you think he would be sitting in an interrogation room but almost his attitude is like kind of mildly annoyed about this whole thing like it's just so inconvenient that he's there and after a couple of hours he actually starts to get rude and basically like he's put out by the police disturbing him for something as silly as a murder investigation and it's then hours later among his annoyance that he starts to change his story"], [0.9764028787612915, " now he says well I actually left dorian's with Jennifer he tells police now that they decided to leave at the same time they didn't just like part ways outside of door now he has them walking together up 86th Street in the direction of Central Park at this point the police pump the brakes for a second like it's usually a sign of something big when statements start changing and they're thinking okay we may have our prime suspect in our hands right here right now which would be great because the media is already all over this thing so it to make sure nothing is messed they call in the assistant district attorney and they ask Robert if he's willing to make another statement and they want this one recorded so he's like yeah for sure let's let's start rolling so watching the video the thing that gets me the most is Robert whole attitude like I don't know if you've ever watch any of like the Brat Pack movies from the 80s but he's got this very in Thai"], [0.9710867404937744, " sealed air about him like if you seem Pretty in Pink he totally reminds me of like the James Spader rich boy attitude like consequences are for other people and even in the second recorded interview he still super, as he starts to tell his story about what happened the night before now according to Robert he does see her at dorian's they do leave at the same time but this time they aren't just like walking up the street together this time his story is a Jennifer wanted to go into Central Park with him and he says he wasn't interested in any of it and he just wanted to go home but went with her anyway and he goes on to tell police and the Ada that she went to the bathroom like somewhere off in the shadows when they got to the park then she came back and started putting the moves on him even tying up his hands behind his back with her own underwear because according to him she says that she thinks he looks cuter if he's tied up"], [0.9628636240959167, " as Robert continues with his story he tells police that Jennifer then sits on his chest facing away from him reaches into his pants and sexually assaulted him scratching his chest while she did it and he says he's in pain he scared he couldn't get away because his hands were tied and know right away red flags are going up for the cops in the Ada because they don't buy any of that now a lot of their skepticism came from the idea at the time that they believed men couldn't be rate which we know is totally false right if you happen to anybody regardless of gender but I got to say I'm kind of with the police on this one I'm having a hard time buying the story that he like couldn't get away was Jennifer like super tall or strong like I guess I'm wondering how was she able to overpower have so no she wasn't like super tall is over 6 ft tall"],

police don't think there's any way she could have done what Roberts saying unless he let her do it no Robert continues with his story and it doesn't become any more believable according to him eventually he gets one hand free and manages to toss Jennifer off of him he says after he pushed her off then she just doesn't move in at first he says he thinks that she's just like kidding around but here's the thing when he's talking about her to please a telling them the story I push her off he says something really strange he doesn't use her name he calls her the body like the body didn't move which is super strange but it's also a contradiction be"], [0.9175075888633728, " if you if you thought you was joking around and kidding but then she's not just a body like you wouldn't think she was a dead body it doesn't make sense so when police ask him what he did next no one could have expected his bizarre response"], [0.9747194051742554, " you've heard us say it before Ashley and I
