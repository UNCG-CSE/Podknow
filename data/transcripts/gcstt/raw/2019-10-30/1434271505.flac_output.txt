sabotaging rhyme self-sabotaging and then nobody does anything about it and that's why I love so much about your book it is and you quizzes and all these great things now you have six steps that we can do to then I guess become less of a self sabotager can you take us through some of those steps totally so you know for me I think realizing that it's rooted in our biology was to stop number one even though it's not called set number one in my book I think that's just the beginning of how we take this journey and really it's biologically rooted because human beings all only have two drives

yourself to them it's like a never-ending turn your high school or you and yeah it's so true I feel like it's just such a comparison all the time to other people's highlight reels you know it's constantly sore like their highlights of their lives and you're thinking all the ways in which you don't measure up and Kayla to your question of like why we do it well I don't think it's always conscious but I do think that certain things make us predisposed to do it more so than others and so I made this acronym called life that explains that the underlying drivers of ourselves sabotaging they range from lower shaky self concept in an area flag to like internalized beliefs we learned as a child to fear of the unknown or change and then finally accepted me for control and I find that almost everybody I talked to her words with directly they will say that either"], [0.9710779786109924, "one of those factors resonates with them or like several but either way that those are like the

your thing and if I knew what I would end up being and I don't completely wrong sometimes happen and what's so nice about it is now knowing that okay this is the area I need to work on which was low

job of making all the questions Universal and then having us realize what we need to work on that will thank you yeah I think it is it is scary to try to take the assessment cuz you're like really want to know this about myself I sometimes yeah but I guess I tell everybody like if you're interested in self-development at all like it's not always going to be roses like someone you find out stuff you like who I really did not like that but that's cool because that discomfort as human beings like makes us want to go far because we don't like that discomfort we don't like it when like our words don't match our actions or our actions don't match our thinking and so like when we have that kind of dissonance like we're driven to change and so I think that's really like the Catalyst for change

Thank you and then it for the final step for step 6 it's create a blueprint for Change and I've heard them more described as like vision boards but you essentially want to accumulate all this information that the readers learn about themselves and apply it to this last chapter one day I want to write an op-ed about like why vision boards don't work because I have done in their inspiring but it doesn't necessarily mean that it helps you accomplish it so they are inspiring and visual tools are amazing and so I can't stay like that vision boards are all bad but it's more like you get to put like your your positive images on this on this sheet of paper on this poster but then"], [0.9651373624801636, "like no point A to point B like how do you get from point A to point B and so the blueprint for change is different because like a blueprint of a house anybody who looks at it will be like okay so the bathroom goes there and this is what it measures and here's where the door is right and this is how I built this house and that's really the idea of the blueprint for change is like not only are you putting the positive images there you're making sure that all of the steps to take to change your behavior also on that same paper and you're making sure that your values are feeding into your goals that that's the way at the top of the blueprint and that you're always resent her on that and so the idea that it is sort of like your kind of tool kit at a glimpse you know you can just look at it and be like I know what I need to do I know what's driving me today like and I know how to get there if your arm is done but everything's written up so that last step is really sore adding everything together and my putting it all together in a special tool that you can record and I love how you can use you tell us to pick a specific element everyday to focus on and then also to make it interactive where once some things done just you"], [0.9700286984443665, "add more to it you can always add more to your blueprint as needed so it's not just you finish it it's done then you can just so you know right cut paste on top of blue printed it always changes depending on what you want to do and so yeah it's not like a used it once and I throw it away it's like let's keep recycling in and putting you things on it and it's setting you up with a with an enamel goals and that's what I'd actually gives you that like you know I can get steps it's little steps as opposed to like there's this one big thing in the years that's were probably people go wrong with a think about goals to is that like of course it's awesome have big old you should have huge huge goals but you also need like the medium and small goals and signs you have like a big goals and like they don't fill in the rest and it's like let's fill in the other steps of the ladder likes about the top but like what what's what's wrong what's wrong to what's wrong with three right to get you there

and they were doing math and like who likes math and maybe some people but most people do not like that and there were two groups of see what they were given different goals so like one group of students I just told them to 50 pages or whatever like that and then to the other group of pages each day over 10 days it's 50 pages total but they found that when they instructed the kids to do five pages a day that they actually reach the 50 much quicker and that's my day went above and beyond that where is like when you told someone just do 50 pages like they just didn't Dumaguete to 20 or 30
