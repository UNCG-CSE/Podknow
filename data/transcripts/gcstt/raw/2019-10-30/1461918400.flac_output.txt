      " made up by the rumor mill best had an answer for that as well the culprits were children in an interview for the documentary killer Legends best said if you think about it this is a terrific kind of prank it's easy enough to come by a pin and easy enough to stick it in a candy bar and then run in and say look mom there's a pain in my candy bar"

      " best theorize that the childhood need for attention from parents led to some children tricking adults into believing that their candy was dangerous but even in the face of this evidence the endless fear machine of whispered rumors is impossible to stop a few years after the study was published the advice column ask Ann Landers read another article renewing the warnings about the dangers of Halloween once again she repeated this mess to her faithful readers in recent years there have been reports of people with Twisted Minds putting razor blades and poison in taffy apples and Halloween candy it is no longer safe to let your child eat treats that come from strangers"

      " even in the face of a complete lack of evidence Halloween the sadist was a myth that would never die in the eyes of many parents the mere possibility of danger is more powerful than the academic studies disproving it as definitive as Joel best research was the myth of the Halloween sadist is almost synonymous with the classic term stranger danger and just like the Halloween sadist stranger danger is itself a myth perpetuated by parental paranoia statistics have regularly shown that children are at greater risk of abuse and abduction from adults they already know then by random strangers Halloween becomes a stand-in for whatever group is undermining Society in the eyes of concerned Suburban parents or even law enforcement"

      " as recently as 2017 over-enthusiastic drug enforcement agencies stoked fears that certain marijuana edibles were being designed to appear similar to Halloween candy the fear of unsuspecting children being drugged without their knowledge was alive and well there was no real risk of deception the FDA required all marijuana candy used to be labeled as such and no instance of weed dealers attempting to drug children have been recorded but as we have established the spread of an urban legend is completely immune to facts or evidence"

      " Halloween is a holiday based on fear it is the one night where we let the darker parts of our imaginations run wild ghosts ghouls and goblins run freely among Ordinary People on the night of October 31st people are very good at determining what imaginary monsters scare them identifying real threats on this night of nightmares is surprisingly difficult"

      " should we fear roaming gangs who made mistake are innocent Halloween costume for arrivals color coded uniform like trash fires on Mischief night or should we fear a stranger who seems friendly on the outside but slips a poisoned piece of candy in amongst our Loot and Landers wrote that the dark side of this holiday is that hundreds of children will be injured and some baby killed but they're real dark side of Halloween maybe something far less easy to defend against the possibility that fear will cause you to look for danger where there is none and while you're so focused on stoking fears of some fictional Boogeyman you're more likely to be blind to the very real threats that exist in the world"
