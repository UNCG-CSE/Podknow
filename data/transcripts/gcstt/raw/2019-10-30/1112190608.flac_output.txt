have flies and what you do is you you amplify those personal flies as the doorway that leads them to the mouth of the supernatural so there is this sense that even a small transgression can be so

some kind of display you know listen to some sort of like warning to the community what it's just a sick I will need someone might say oh it was an oversight or whatever but that oversight are you kidding me that and that kind of trauma is something that we live with so even if we don't know Mike Brown that might not be my son we know it could be our side that could be our street right and it
