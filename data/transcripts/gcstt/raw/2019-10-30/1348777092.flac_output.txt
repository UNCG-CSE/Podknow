Sorry but everybody's different I mean we all the episodes for me it was like I moved to New York City and I knew I was you I want to do more comedy and eventually start this podcast Reina went to culinary school and she took up photography and she just started pursuing these things that you travel a lot of things that I just wasn't doing I was like what I have left absolutely like actually changed her whole life she was sitting and yeah I don't"], [0.9805616736412048, " cancel it fine I guess relationships too and if I moved to close to my family but I've never been closer to my family like they are just the most important thing in my life and you said you know when you were with your ex fiance you lost touch with a lot of friends and now I'm you have more girlfriends than anybody I know what side for me and I just think it's a part of its that too right yeah let the relationship just be my whole life and I do that if you want to do that but like I didn't Foster friendships I didn't make an effort to go out to dinner with other girlfriend which he was beat when you be late at work or something I just stayed at home I he didn't really have the money to travel I didn't travel he didn't have the money to like take Hobbies up and take classes I just didn't take classes and I just let that be okay and like I said that's fine I was young and nobody told me to build a life I was proud of you. All right I was thinking like a society just tells you to be a wife and a mother my mother never told me to get my Mother by my parent's house for years old I am very loving and supportive parents like Ashley"], [0.9374767541885376, " we're not together in my home so my mom said like God forbid a man leaves you have a job you can fall back onto that's all that's what I grew up on have money but

we do is looking at your pie and it sounds like your pie was filled with relationship relationship relationship so if you look at a pie and like you divide that up into different slices of how much energy and time you're spending on relationship on self-care on play on education on on work and I know with the woman I ever knew that pies very skewed the slice of the pie reserved for a relationship is usually 60% maybe even 70% and that happens often slowly you can start off with I'm an independent powered women and then you're like what he travels a lot for work so I just have to wait leave my weekends open in case he sprayed decision decision limit after limit that you breed like I just want to see my friends this weekend because and then you get to a point where suddenly it's just all relationship and that pie what's that like white from"], [0.9730569124221802, " being independent woman who's doing SoulCycle and like doing like women's brunches to like 70% me and him yeah I know like how the fuck did I got here why do I feel so disempowered and so I think a great exercise for anyone listening is right down your pie how does that look like right now is it balanced is it you know 70% relationship is it no relationship at all and then write another pot draw another pine what is a more balanced healthy pie that you can strive for and if you're in a relationship now just making sure you look at it till I remind yourself like oh you know what I got to add more self-care I have to add more Community or if you have a tendency to be codependent and wanting to merge with your partner creating a pie and remind yourself to not do that because you want to keep a balance will and nobody wants a partner that there the whole pie I mean maybe some controlling men but I think for the most part healthy Partners don't want to be your hoe"], [0.963778018951416, " hi and I think that's we think that people can pick up on that and that's not just specific to women I don't want some of that super needy and I don't want to feel like I'm someone's whole world and if and if we break up there likes going to be over so I think it's for that too it's just to attract the right type of partner totally backed yourself into that corner you're suddenly in a situation where like you have to accept everything that person is doing cuz hopefully you have to do without it yeah we had another Gaston I'm Lindsey Lindsey metselaar from a podcast call we met at Acme"], [0.9722632169723511, " she just said when you think about if you broke up with this person what would you have it's nothing a good mic drop ya exactly anything else that you feel like we don't want you to give away your whole break a bouquet of the wrong people to come at any other just unique tools about getting through breakups that you want to share whether there were related to renew or not yeah so I think one thing that could be very helpful for anyone who's trying to let something go is actually creating a ritual and a rite of passage around it when you're going through a break-up there's a part that's dying right there's a sold relationship that's dying and and you're making space for the new and so honored that have respect in the ritual of that and what we do at Renew is one of the nights we have them write a letter and it's that same letter that I wrote to my X-Men"], [0.9721646904945374, " 30 years ago and in that letter write down what happened the facts of what happened not your interpretation then write down your own accountability and what happened because it takes two people to be in a relationship and it's not all he's an asshole she's bitch it's not all bad and then take a look and and see what is it that you learned what did you learn about yourself there's such great lessons are our relationships teachers that pain teaches us find those lessons and then write down what you're letting go write down what you are forgiving and then write down what you're grateful for maybe that was the push you needed to leave your hometown to start investing into your friendships again to realize that too much of your identity was wrapped up in one other person and feel the Gratitude of that and thank that person for helping you learn all of that and after that take that letter and burn it and if you need"], [0.9563727378845215, " repeat this process multiple times I've had women at Renew who after the boot camp have done it multiple times go and do that but it's very cathartic absolutely price recommended every time I get on get on stage episodes was about how to get over break a leg right now and Ashley said like just make the pros and cons list like physically sit down and look at the only thing in the cons, so you don't love me the way that I deserve to be loved and I just like love that you said that it's still like resonates with me like 50 episodes ago if that's the only thing in the cons call Mike do that right that last in like look at that all the time and so I mean you say to light it on fire if you don't have to let it run back and I think the pros and the cons list is a little different yours is more like reflecting the relationship in the good that came out of it but I think the pros and cons of us is looking for that it's just like in the moment get the sun writing this was not the person for me and this is how they made me feel and this is why they"], [0.9715269207954407, " aren't the person for me and I just to say I don't know a woman out here and he was my friends are really love their lives and their successful in there where they want to be no one has ever like I still wish I was with my ex are at the break up with is still the worst thing that ever happened to me like I know we've all been through a terrible breakup salt me and all of my girlfriends and I think everybody reflects on it as it was supposed to happen and I'm so glad it did and I can't imagine being with that person and here's what it taught me and here's what it did for my life over all you only don't get to that realization when you just keep trying to hang on to the relationship I hanging onto the pain and not accepting reality right and it's some it's easier said than done but if that person is going to be with you you shouldn't want to be with them deserve somebody that wants to pick you up. That's what a relationship is two people choosing to be in it yeah"], [0.967660665512085, " well this is amazing really I'm thrilled with this thank you so much I can't find her if you have one thing okay so the last thing I want to leave you with is sometimes we create a relationship app in our heads and so what this means is you might go on a few dates with someone and it starts off pretty level they like you I like them and then you start daydreaming about the person and they said they wanted to retire in Bali one day and you wanted to retire and Wally one day in your life your soulmate bells are ringing and so in between your you're creating the status of Henry playing the fantasy and it feels so good and your body actually can't tell the difference between what's happened the past the present and the future so that's why when you keep telling the same re-traumatizing story of"], [0.9758487939834595, " happened with a pass breakup and catching infidelity you can be flooded with tears because your body is actually creating stress hormones will the same things happening it when you are creating a fantasy about someone I coined this future trippin and so it's it's creating all these feelings of the chemicals of dopamine and all these feel good chemicals and suddenly what's happening is you're feeling Skyrocket for that person and then you might go on a few more dates and suddenly something feels off the power Dynamic is a bit off and then you're clamoring for their attention you want more and then it falls apart and then you're like completely heartbroken this is a very common thing that happens at Renew with the women who have tell their stories where they were in these relationships and in their head they were married and had children and retarded Mollie like five times already where is in the head of the person they were dating they went on a few dates had some good sex and that was that"], [0.96843421459198, " and so if you have a tendency to do this and if you have a tendency to meet someone get really excited and suddenly you're feeling sorry Skyrocket what I would suggest you is to do what's called the stop sign exercise and what this is is whether you're ruminating about the past and critics Society or your future tripping about a future that hasn't happened imagine close your eyes imagine a big red stop sign and then say the word stop and then look around you and just start to look for everything you're grateful for I just be like Oh I'm grateful for the beautiful sky right now beautiful for the Rave I'm beautiful and I'm grateful for this cute dog and just keep going because what that's going to do if it's going to distract your mind from the original thought and eventually if you keep practicing this the first few times that might be

life with this person and it's what you were busy and fulfilled and kill it in life and doing other things in your hobbies and work out and you have a scheduling you're really living life you just don't have the time and energy to do that I think I love you said visualization for wine like people like my visualize stop sign I'm like yeah it's a big like that you would like to visualize it and
