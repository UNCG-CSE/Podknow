what you want and it's a horrible risk cuz it doesn't just lead to World War one but the interwar years rise of Nazis World War I mean it's a disaster but Germany had a decent chance in that war they

Empire what do you get up and and getting them all fired up patriotically and in the second world before the second world war you see the same Dynamic going on in Japan in the book Japan at war in

Mission of Mercy sound very different but what motivates a person to want to go do these things are sometimes the most idealistic and high-minded reasons so there's a real irony there when the
