      "is going to win really easily in 2020 but whether voters see this as a way to sort of a register their vote of support for President Trump which I think is the case that he's going to be making when he campaigns in Kentucky and Mississippi this weekend okay let's start with Kentucky digging in who are the players here so Matt Bevin is the incumbent governor elected in 2015 you may remember him because he ran against Mitch McConnell in 2014 in the primary but then went on to to become the governor later on which was really a surprise even then and he is actually for Kentucky even though it voted heavily for Trump by 30 points is actually but it's sort of ancestrally democratic it sort of the other and it has Appalachia there as well and he's actually only the third Republican Governor since World War II in the state so I mean in the state legislature didn't shift to Republican"

      "troll until 2016. He is being challenged by Andy beshear that name is Vaguely Familiar sounding yeah because the thing that Bashir is really trying to play up is the idea of respect and the reason for that is because Matt Bevin is one of the lowest rated Governor's approval rating wise in the country only 34% and according to the latest morning consult poll on his approval rating in part of that is because of how he has this sort of a cervix style you know he's kind of a tea party guy he says what he thinks is on his mind and because of that he's really aligned himself a lot with President Trump because as just notes it went by almost 30 points for Trump in the presidential election he really needs the present to pull them over the finish line but she reposes President Trump his top supporters want to impeach our president Matt bevin's moving Kentucky"

Add he plays up the stairs Scare Tactics you can see these members of MS-13 gang is like climbing over the wall and he says you know Andy beshear stands with the illegal immigrants he talks about how he's pro-life and so he's really he has nationalized this race to an extent that we typically do not see any Governor's races on to Mississippi this is another race that were watching who are the candidates so Tate Reeves is the lieutenant governor and he sort of your establishment style politician but he's kind of wonky and nerdy and then you have him running against the Attorney General Democrat Democrat there Jim Hood his ads he's in his pickup truck you show some carrying he's with his gun he's pro-life and so it really is a very drastic different style there I think we have an ad from that to vibrate my own hook carry my own gun and drive my own truck a democrat in a deep red State this is how you do is like the perfect candidate that you could create"

      "in a lab however this is I think of the three states this is Republicans best chance and here's why there's a little quirk in the Mississippi it's actually still a Jim Crow era law that they are challenging in court but probably not going to be decided in time where I can and it has to not only win a majority of the popular vote they also have to win a majority of the State Legislative districts or like this many electoral college if they don't do that then the race actually gets kicked to the state legislature where Republicans have a supermajority so that is sort of Reeves his insurance policy and Democrats I talk to you they acknowledge it's really hard for Jim Hood even for all of his word of likability and things in the fact that he has been elected Statewide before to do that right Louisiana is the last date on our list here and right now there is a Democratic governor John Bel Edwards he is up for re-election and President Trump certainly doesn't want him to win so Republicans would have called him and Ashley this sort of accidental governor"

      "we have seen a recent elections this increasing rural vs Urban Suburban divide that just The World vote and Barry White parishes there was really up and Edwards really needed High black turnout especially to when he did not get that to that is what he has to do in order to win on the 16th these three races really are going to test the limits of partisanship in a lot of ways because John Bel Edwards is a Democrat who's the governor in the South it's not the kind of thing you see very often but he's been able to have this kind of record where he wants to say that he's reaching across the aisle and working with Republicans in the state in fact so much so that he doesn't really even talked about the fact that he's a Democrat. Edwards is the only Democratic governor still in this deep south Interstate to we are going to take a quick break and when we get back we are headed to Virginia closer to home here where guns are at the center of the races that will decide who will control the legislature their support for this podcast in the following"
