category is something he calls a duct taper rather than fix serious headaches many organizations take the easy route their paper over the problem David has a revealing story from his own life this was quite early on my time in the UK University system and they had this shelf in my office I was a little worried about it some kind of precarious and one day does completely ripped out of the wall

second category of Bossier jobs David this one involves managers will come up with meeting us assignments for their subordinates you call them taskmasters that's right now A Taskmaster is a type of bullshit job which involves one there's two different types actually one of them is simply a supervisor of people who don't need supervision and a lot of middle managers wrote to me and said that they have that kind of job no often they've done a certain job they got promoted to management so they knew what was impaled doing the job and they knew the basically they didn't need supervision at all but they had to pretend they were supervising them anyway but another type is exactly what I was describing the case of universities people whose job seems to end up being creating paperwork and unnecessary task Brother people to do so again to go back to middle management example say you did have a job and you got promoted to Supervisor on that job and you knew they didn't need supervision

give them paperwork to do to make sure they're hitting their targets and then they'll be something to file and process and we'll have something that you can do the classic example of comes from the story of a woman named Chloe she was one of the few people who was in academic Administration in the higher echelons who is willing to come forward and admit that's too and she said well you know I took on this job as a non-executive d-does non-executive basically means you have no power you don't control money so your your strategic you're supposed to come up with ideas but you have no real

when he isn't you're going to be us jobs that I designed to paper over problems that an organization cannot or does not want to fix David also describes a third type of BS job on the surface these jobs are not pointless but the only reason an organization has them is because other organizations have them"], [0.959945797920227, " did it cause the people who walk these jobs goons I asked him what he meant by the term I had to make that up because so many people wrote to me we've jobs that I had we anticipated jobs would involve a certain element of aggression which might have seen necessary or helpful to the corporation they weren't completely useless but not the people doing them felt shouldn't exist anyway largely because they felt the entire industry or profession was unnecessary so telemarketers for a great example with the special offer for telemarketers felt strongly that I mean 95% of telemarketers I'm sure feels strongly that if all telemarketers were to vanish many puffs of

feudal rents but know if you really look at the matter who are they protecting The Peasants from other feudal Lords so we can wait there for another few the Lord is feudal Lords & Beyond necessary"], [0.8365758657455444, " that's what that's why I called in goons there's an element in there but on the other hand you know they're only there because other such aggressive people exist"], [0.9600493311882019, " David says another BS job is the flunky these jobs primarily exist to make someone or something look impressive classic monkeys of the past of including things like Gorman or actually why you always read about them in Alice in Wonderland Louisa 19th century books and he's really fancy military looking uniforms with the thing they actually did was they ran in front of people's car just looking for bumps in the road so it goes all ideas if I have a servant just to do this with one basically kind of Superfluous not really totally necessary thing I'm really rich and important so you should know that"], [0.9704033136367798, " and That's a classic funky often flunkies will be assigned one very minor tasks sort of like the guy who tweezers the Lord's mustache before a jouster something like that but really they're just they're so that everybody could know I've got lots of servants but in the corporate world is very much the same because in the corporate world the actual status of an executive is often measured by how many people work on her so he has no incentive to get rid of unnecessary employees and in fact you often find people saying yeah I'm I'm just there to make someone else look important seem important receptionist's often say that obviously some receptions are very busy and have a real job but there are some receptionist who knows maybe they get one phone call Jack to otherwise they change the candy bowl or water the plants or something to basically they're just sitting around"], [0.9716836810112, " so white lamp perception is that all you know if it's just one call a day do I get to take the call themselves right the reason why is because if you don't ever receptionist you don't look like a real Corporation one reason that companies end up with BS jobs is that it sometimes difficult or impossible or unpleasant to get rid of people who are not functioning well you mentioned the example of the of the guy who's apologizing for the carpenter not showing up now it could just be that getting rid of that guy hiring another Carpenter might be administratively owner is so talk to me about this idea that part of the problem actually just be you originally and how organizations work and instead of basically you know getting rid of the person you don't want to find me the person you do want you end up sometime just keeping the person you don't want or now hiring an additional person to come in and do the job that you actually do need to get done I was one of my favorite examples actually because I know the taskmasters

one reason that you end up getting so many bowls of jobs in large bureaucracies if someone has seniority and no good reports up well it's almost impossible to fire them so if suddenly they become a drunkard just know lose interest in the job become bad at what they do the easiest thing to do instead of getting rid of them is to hire someone else to do their job because I or someone else to do their job you can't admit that they're doing their job right so you have to make up a different job and then often you have to walk them through get the mosquito tell them what to put on their TVs

things become celliant only after you started doing the job so it's always our our psychological biases partly to blame for the proliferation of BS jobs I think it's partly to the world talk to people want something for nothing on you think about economics what is economics teacher basically that we all want something for nothing that you know people wish to get the maximum benefit for the least expenditure of time and resources an effort so so no according to economics anybody who was handed a job where they're paid good money to do nothing should be happy as a clam you know so one of the
