So funny is I would like when would I ever use this but you would use it because you present during all the timers at the collection so it's funny it like there's certain things in school I don't know if you thought about this but I was like there's no way I'm going to use this but it does make sense around me to get into the industry cuz a lot of people going with expectations I like what is this going to be like and you just can't really imagine it to you there right yeah I know it yeah I think he know I wouldn't say at the end of school it was you know I had my craft fully developed or I knew everything I needed to know like after school is when the real work really starts and that's when you know"], [0.9580073952674866, ' take all of these foundational things that you learned in

actually interned but I really believe in internships you know if I've had a lot of interns myself it's about my career and I think it's such an important part of you know getting your foot in the door and really broaden your perspective and seeing like a great snapshot of behind-the-scenes what goes into the fattest a career in fashion because there's so much work that goes on and you really see the reality of it come to life and you see you know just how much work goes into developing a line and watching a creative team work together and how fast pace it is so I think internships are great but yeah and I actually never did find myself which is kind of surprising actually is ice a lot I did I did I interned in a couple of showrooms so I experienced sales I did a PR agency I did magazine"], [0.9727146029472351, " which was it was a smaller one cuz it was like during filming so it was kind of limited but I still I got I got to see so many different things and so we having it all within the industry but they all just like took such they all require different skills and different interests and for me and hurting was sort of like a trial not so much like it wasn't as a surly about like them hiring me it was more like am I interested in the right when I was like I'm not like for me mac the magazine industry and it was I don't know what was that for you to kind of realized right away you know and that's what's great about interning as you can just see you know there's so many different Avenues you can take in fashion and it gives you early on an idea of okay yes no yes no this is for me this isn't and then you kind of can just keep moving forward and find your own path"], [0.9792864322662354, " are you involved and I called has a great internship program do they really do during summer or is it it's it's happens in summer and then fall through I think it happens two times a year okay yeah it's a great program though so are you involved in the hiring at all I do yeah I am I do a lot of the interviewing I got to be involved in the interviewing process there which is really exciting so I get to meet with a lot of the candidates myself which is great so if you're I've only done like a handful of interviews for different jobs throughout my life I've conducted interviews and it's like a weird thing cuz I feel like I've interviewed I've been the interviewee more than the interviewer ask people questions what are you looking for when you're sitting down with someone I'm looking for someone who's passionate who's highly-engaged who you know I

you're looking for them to be a part of but I think just someone who's engaged focused passionate who is able to package their ideas and articulate themselves really well when it comes to their work because that's something that's a skill that you just in the industry need to you know really need to be comfortable as and you need to be able to you know everything that you do you have to present so how you package your ideas is such an important part of your role as a designer so I definitely do look at the portfolio how their lips are the presenting their work yeah it's the first thing you mentioned was personality because that's honestly the biggest thing for me I think as long as you're willing to learn I never expected in turn to to come in like fully prepared and with all the knowledge that that's why they're there of course but just like someone who's really like a team player and they're just there"], [0.9612511396408081, " do to be helpful and to really experience the

just just try and beat you know really positive and an easygoing and that's going to give you yeah I mean that's everything right we when you're interning it's all about just being open and absorbing

[0.9753340482711792, " so one thing that I love for you to explain because I think people liked somewhat of an understanding of what goes on behind the scenes when you're developing a line but it's always it's really interesting to me like how fast-paced it was like what I see when I started working with Kohl's like it's a it's a very large well-oiled machine but it's just so many moving Parts it's crazy do you want to give like a really quick description of like start to finish how you would desire a line and when I say a line close has monthly collection so do something when you do so I think you know when I think about the process of developing a collection or align the the most important thing to start with is a really Clear Vision right you have to really invest the time with yourself thinking through with your fist yourself your team with you thinking through you know what is it that we are trying to achieve what is the story we want to tell and it just putting the right amount of energy into"], [0.9753686785697937, " because without a clear InFocus Vision the rest of the execution of the line is it can be really challenging so I think for me but such an important part of the process and it's something that we do so well where do you find the most inspiration is it you know just kind of paying attention to what trends are out there on the runway and high-fashion is it entertainment is it yeah is it what what is it that usually directs that there's different sources of inspiration number one is always the customer we're always looking to our customer for inspiration whether it be how she's wearing the line what she's fine when she's not buying so she is always number one second is you know we pull inspiration obviously for much is happening at retail at large and having your finger on the pulse of you know this is a tapping in the market and set the trends that we're seeing showing up this is how we're seeing color evolve how we're seeing you know outfitting shift and the way that you"], [0.9625726938247681, " cool. Inspiration is comes in multiple facets it comes from you know shopping internationally it comes from paying attention to what's happening on runaway to paying attention to what's happening commercially in retail and then also you know being analyzed the designer of hitting a lot of attention to just your own intuition and noticing like what it is you're responding too and really paying attention to what feeling that evokes and analyzing okay you know I might be looking at something and it makes me feel a certain way I'm gravitating towards it because of the color or the print or the pattern and really spending time looking at that analyzing it and yourself why and then applying that to your work now I feel like a lot of times you pull like artwork or like photography and it sort of pulling the colors out of that and creating a story that way and I should mention that not only are you doing this you're also having to take into consideration The Collection that delivers the month before and the month after and making sure that there's a flow there so you can't just have like a random story every month"], [0.9599245190620422, " you're also like you're like being creative and you want it to look different in fresh and new but you wanted to sit because the reality of retail is that like nothing it's not the entire collection sells out in the next ones delivered like there's a lot of crossover so it all has to like nicely said together but stand apart that's what we've been challenging me to me I was crazy as we're working on so many different deliveries all at once and then you know isn't it I always find it I never remember what year it is because it's you know we're working on spray or the same time so all of the deliveries to start overlapping yes and then also when I come to New York and I'm doing all of my meetings all at once every every category has a different time lines are parallel Ray the fact is that right yes so I'll go from your meeting and apparel to like handbags or shoes which have like a really long lead"], [0.9778716564178467, " I'm so I'm always asking what year were talking about cuz I wanna make sure like things are aligning that's one of the challenges I have always faced like when looking at the collection is a whole as you want to make sure it's always cohesive each month but everyone's developing a different times and it's like you don't necessarily want to have like shoes lead the apparel but then also like shoes has a wider collection it's all very confusing when you have to have we have to build their Peril concept for the shoe line even get started being the I mean yeah yeah you so there's so much you have to think about okay so you've developed the concept you've made your Beautiful Boards you have the fabric swatches you've purchased artwork which is always really fun to live in his heart rate and may you think that to those who never been in a meeting like that it's basically a different Studios that come with giant suitcase and they have just like a hundreds and hundreds of other little friend like to buy two pieces of fabric that they flipped their own you flip through all this artwork and you pick you up you purchase artwork from art"], [0.9740240573883057, " best to use on your garments and sometimes it's easier even like buying a piece of art for like a single flower sometimes you love everything about it sometimes you're like this is beautiful we have to change every color like it's just such a thought and I don't know those are some of my favorite meeting it's important part of the process rights to artwork and oh yeah it's like you know it really does it speaks for you when you're not there to sort of speak to the DNA of the brand when you're walking to the store and you know the clothing is there the art in the color is heard of the voice of the brand right if you think about it that way so it's so important to make sure you're getting that right and that the motifs in the color and that the use of pattern really captures the essence of yeah you're trying to achieve I don't always understand like how much that goes into that right like for example this year animal prints were really big and so like as a brand we have to look at that and say how do we interpret that like we're not going to do like a classic leopard print patches"], [0.9690293669700623, " us but we can do like a micro leopard in like nude and blush that you like barely see it's more of a texter but we're still addressing the trends the right leg and even just like the medium in which the arts created to like we're always going to look where we going to love like watercolor is in more painterly interpretations of florals where is like other brands are going to do like pop your graphics yeah I just the our work is so important and and we have so much fun looking through it so then what do you do next you got it all so okay so yeah you have your vision you have your art then you start sourcing are Fabrications right so I'm not a part of this cuz this is the least fun I did I did I did my time with sourcing and dealing with minimums and all of that.

industry whether you need to know how to sew to work in design and why there's so much inconsistency when it comes to women sizing"], [0.9208434820175171, " Katie wants to know if you know how to sell I do know how to sew I mean I haven't done it yet I haven't done it in a while but I was thinking about actually getting my sewing machine out of storage and starting to cycle again but my Brother sewing machines that we learned on his school the really high power ones we had to like put your foot down and like sew a button repair a tear I embroider does that count I can't have definitely can I have a whole garment like I'm like a needle and thread I don't think I could do that now I mean maybe back in the day right out of school but now they think I can make a pillow neck pillow"], [0.9749640822410583, " was that wants to know what are some friends that never really go away like what are things that we're always maybe it's not every season but it's like a really eat like a wrap dress right as a good example like that's never going to go anywhere I also think about just items or outfits that never go away just looks like looks at just are a Timeless and season last and then just are always going to be classic things like a white tiene moto jacket back to make a great pair of denim that sort of look in the items that support that look you know those are always just around things like all white dressing you know those types of Trends they're just they're always going to be cool there always going to make you feel great a wrap dress is another great example of a good Blazer like the perfect Blazer definitely yeah I think it's trends like that they're going to the Silhouettes are going to shift through time so that Blazer it's going to be shrunken"],

black dress yeah like the shape might change Orleans yeah they send the trend in how people are addressing but the idea that you know that trend is going to just stay up forever Jen wants to know why pockets are so sorely missing and women's clothing took a question I also think you know have you ever noticed the pocket bag the size of the pocket bag in women's pants is what is really short so tiny quarter I know it's and then you know guys can't they have like the longest time ever I mean that has to do with the way your fitting the Garment right because it's flat it's more flattering to have a smaller pocket bag you know on app and then it is having a bunch of fabric do you want the gene to fit you well at the pan to fit you well and then you know the same goes with like the reason"], [0.9597844481468201, " maybe isn't as many pockets on women's clothing it's because the place it might be off or you know the placement off and off and hits right at the hip right so I mean I've altered clothing and have pockets removed white denim I always have them taken out cuz they show crew I just sew it shut and cut the honestly I would say every pair of white denim in my closet is for my own line and I'm very fortunate because when we shoot it we have a tailor on so we can probably cut it out can you just cut the pockets out real quick it's always a pleasant surprise egg when I have a full skirt and then I find a pocket I'm like oh cool but the reason I guess the simple answer that I would give is that it's usually hits in an unflattering spot or it's costing right it will cost more to have PA yeah I mean if you can spend more money on a greater like a good Fabric or a better quality fabric then he might have to lose the pocket so he's our sisters compromises you have to make"], [0.9793079495429993, " I'm so sorry Jen"], [0.9178236722946167, " there's not a lot of pockets in our stuff"], [0.9633338451385498, " Katie says women's sizing why is there so much inconsistency so I think she means like from Brandy Brands like that can't be right I mean we'll see each brand fits on its own fit model right in the fit models are provided by an agency and the way each brand fits their garments might be different because of the ascetic so we know within our brand we want everything to be comfortable we wanted to be versatile we wanted to have like the perfect amount of ease and just the right places so that's how we fit our clothing and then another brand might want things to be a bit more bodycon or a bit more you know low-cut or I don't know whatever and so the way that you know that brand fits their garments is going to feel a little bit different"], [0.9722772240638733, " yeah everyone has a signature fit and also I've I've experienced this I'm sure you have as well like where bran clearly got a new fit model that had a completely different body type because like all the pair of jeans I buy for a couple years and then I go to buy the same pair and thus it's completely off and they're like whoa something happens there and I know that like from us we're always just doing our best to cater to a customer so like if we make a certain top for a pair of pants and we're getting consistent feedback about the rise or you know maybe they needed more room across the bus do you know whatever it might be we're taking that into consideration in our fittings so we're really just doing our best to fit a garment that will please the most amount of people that are trying a lot yeah I got going to go easy on I mean we read this customer reviews daily yeah yes because I think a lot a lot of people are really helpful though go on and say I'm this hate this way this is my cup size and this fit me and you know and I I think that's helpful I always tells me weather decides he's down"], [0.9240157604217529, ' yeah read reviews but also'], [0.9533299207687378, " if you buy something really that you really like right and I serve you because you're more likely to give negative feedback then positive and isn't people take reviews like I said really seriously so like if you ever buy something for Moline you really like Take 5 minutes and don't be

that when we travel internationally for inspiration when we're building Concepts and instead of collecting ideas early on in the season I think a lot of people think that that just sounds you notice so easy and So Glamorous but it's so much work it's so much work and you know these trips are great I love them but there's just a lot of work and heavy lifting that goes into it so I feel like that's the one misconception that I think a lot of people have that just threw a walk in the park or something I don't know yeah I think that there is a misconception I think that a lot of people"],

don't really think I don't think a lot of those old rules as their least still apply today do you I don't think so but I wear white to a wedding but I think is Attica Trolls but yeah I think that we're also living in a moment but if action is all over the place right I mean there's there's definitely trends that we're looking at that people are following as far as color and silhouette but they're really I can't run the last time I saw someone and I was just like that's why I called because like yeah anything goes now which is great it's really exciting it's inspiring it really allows
