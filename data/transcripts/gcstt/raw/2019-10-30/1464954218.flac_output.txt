of Cherokee Nation and the deputy Attorney General of our tribe it was passed in 1978 by the United States Congress and research leading up to the Indian Child Welfare act in the Congressional hearings found that one third of all Indian children in the United States were in out-of-home placement and between 85 and 95% of those children were in non-indian or non-relative placements this
