have to like I heard this person and I didn't acknowledge it at the time and now it's too late like I'm not going to text them for years later and be like sorry I'm so sorry that was really shity of me and I think about things like Replay in your head in your like wow I cannot believe I did that I was talking about this last night with McKayla because I was like you ever just be country sometimes

what do you do with those feelings of I hurt someone because like you have hurt someone someone else's hurt you like that's just kind of the way that the world is at a certain point like you you have to forgive yourself when you've done those things I wouldn't say like immediately be like it's fine like I was a dick and it's okay but I think after a while you have to stop torturing yourself I do there was a guy freshman year college and I don't talk about him very much partially because I feel really guilty cuz I was an asshole what did you do"], [0.97737056016922, " so he was like at the sweetest guy he literally was like cheek pinch like adorable guy and that he was really nice and we made out at a party once I was a very drunk forgot completely I didn't forget about it I knew that it happened but then I saw him at a day drink like a little bit after that and he was talking to me and I was like yeah well you know like if you make sure you say something too and I said the guys name and I was like that I say hi or something and he's like yeah I'll make sure to tell him and I'm like snow really like I haven't seen him like since the other weekend like I feel bad like we haven't like talked and he's like I mean we're talking right now and wait wait I did not follow that you were taught I was talking to him and I had forgotten what his face looked like and then I was like okay like what do you mean we're talking right now Kylie was being so mean he's like yeah"], [0.9527665972709656, " and said his name and I was like no you're not you're lying why you fucking with me it's not funny and she was like so her but then we continue to like have a flirtation like he liked would text me to come over and be like totally totally but then I would go hook up with someone else in his Fraternity in front of him but then still continue to text and I think he was my date to dance and I hooked up with another guy in front like it was so bad and it was the same thing as like what can I do that's going to make him not be nice to me"], [0.9773092865943909, " I still don't know what the line was but then he like changed like I broke him like and then all the sudden he turn into like a womanizer and like those douchebags is because of a girl that was a douchebag first like you so pure and then and then he does like it was bad like he was like the fuc to round he heard a lot of feelings any was he did not like me but that's fair because I was an asshole to have yeah and I always wanted to apologize and all his friends but I would tell his friends like I want to apologize and I want all this time they like knowledge he would ever like you can now it's like too late or something I ate me alive like most of cuz I was like I was so mean but like it wasn't about him like I was in such a bad place at that time like I was using him to get over somebody else and Link it was yeah we've all been there like we've all been out all we have all been the asphalt I'm kind of being an asshole right now"], [0.9710834622383118, " completely honest but you have to forgive yourself at a certain point in The Kite how do you just have to apologize like if you can apologize to his friends from high school with my neighbor and he's this huge football player and we were very close but he was like in love with me and it was this problem and I don't know why I wasn't in love with him because he's my type this is the question that I asked myself over and over again I mean he's like why am I not into this person but why don't I like him so he would have parties all the time and I would go and Lily like make out other guys at his home like I broke up with my boyfriend my then-boyfriend and I've always liked you and yeah whatever should get to try to hook up with him and his house and I'm just like so turned off for some reason which is weird because he's a hot man he's probably knew him too long and you went too long I literally like"],

I was like okay like I didn't care if I saw him at a bar at home maybe like a year ago and I was like I am really sorry to whatever for whatever I did to you like years ago like I ruined I don't know why I did that whatever and he's like oh my God like it's fine whatever but that wasn't a cleansing moment for me it's so important to get those cleanses the opportunity to do it yeah I actually felt great I think it takes a lot of self-reflection to realize when like you were the person that really fucked something up yeah it's funny cuz when you remember those moments it's like a faint memory because you're so self-centered when you do it yeah I did I actually do that like when can I really did that it was really that part yeah cuz your your mind is somewhere else I guess when you're doing those"], [0.9571743607521057, " but I think that's important to remember to look when somebody hurts you a lot of times it's like not use Centric and about what they're just so in their own heads in that moment like they're just having a moment of bad of their own making like it's rarely really about you like when I think about the guys like every guy or girl that I ever did something that genuinely I feel horrible about like there's nothing wrong with those people like there were good people I just would be horrible like I said there was something going on in my life yeah yeah I just wasn't I wasn't wanting to handle and so I was being bad like I know not bad but I just wasn't being the person that I know that I am I think we all do that though yeah"], [0.9654280543327332, " but it's I mean I do think of you have the opportunity to apologize apologize and I think that if you don't you have to don't lie awake at night and replay it and think I wish I had and I wish I hadn't sometimes that turns into well if I hadn't and maybe this would have happened and maybe that would have happened and I could have been like this and this and all the sudden you've created this entire fantasy world based on something you didn't do and it's not more regrets then you started legs because I'm a bitch and like all the sudden you hate yourself like you can't talk to yourself like that would you talk to your friend like that maybe you would not care if your friend did Something 2 years ago that was like really mean and they know they feel bad about it would you be like by the way I let me just remind you you are a huge Bishop I think self-awareness is like my most liked a very important quality that you have to have it takes two"], [0.9706377983093262, " yeah and I guess I guess that's what this is about self-awareness yeah yeah because I think it's really is something you don't want to admit about yourself so you have never I never want to admit that you're like wrong about something you never want to admit that you were mean or you were at the the one that fuck something up or you were the person in a friendship that was toxic like but you do have to do a little self-reflection and be like what was it me like I think it's easy to blame things on other people but if you find that every situation you're in is someone else's fault you left at look at it and realize that part of it was probably the common denominator I mean my sophomore year college like blue dick but at the same time like I was being somewhat careless like this by the fact that yes people in my storage is being content like overreacting to a lot of things that didn't need to be reacted to yes that's true but also like I was being Reckless like I was like yeah"],

reason I'm innocent I'm a victim everyone is so mean to me like grow up no one's there are people who are victims absolutely but mostly like we're all we're all autonomous we all make decisions sometimes you make a good decision off and you make a bad decision and acknowledging that is the only way to live a life that's not messy and we were all messy but like not like burning relationships myself I was going on messy but not like I'm ruining every good thing in my life and I don't know why my see if ya like you want to stop doing that self-awareness it's so pretty sure it's true that we are I would say sometimes I'm too self-aware but I guess I'm trying to think of people that I've really hurt it hurts hurts really bad it doesn't about I was very guilty"], [0.9644381999969482, "
