My uncle found a dog attached to a tree and it was all muddy and shit they basically saved the dogs and then he couldn't have the dogs already had too many dogs and then they give it to my mom and dad the dog's name is Lenny and the interesting thing about Lennie is he's never been but fucked by a human now my mom used to tell Lennie whenever you got in your nearest but let it go and because of that my mom thinks Lenny was butt fucked by a guy hey I mean dude when she said it I had to go to the doctor to get my jaw wired back onto my face is it hit the floor dude we were like his previous owner that's what she said my mom 70 a few years ago when she was in her late sixties she said why I think you got butt fucked by one of his previous owners or something like that because when you pet near his butt he ground my brother and I looked at each other for a week and a half just standing there I would like Mom the dog didn't get butt fucked by a guy you know and she was like well and then sit and then yesterday we brought it up and she was like I mean I don't know she tried to backtrack but you really fix it I don't think I said that I don't think I should like Trump I didn't say that exactly I would like to eat that cuz you said it you said also imagine being butt fucked by a an owner and then your previous owner went to go pet your butt and you just growled you kidding me you'd run away dude that was the funniest fucking thing man my mom is crazy like she calls me fucking Kranks for no reason she calls my brother Maffei and me cranks My name is Chris dude she named me that my brother's name is Matthew because I'm Massi just hate cranks hey Maffei locked also she said butt fucked oh man what if he did in my knees like she's the only one that knows yeah do it so funny

long to do this but it did Apple is coming out with an apple card of because of course it is understand the only thing more of course it is is that my mom thing look things letting up butt fucked by previous owner okay Apple card is coming out apple is coming out with a card first of all people don't come out with the card but it did naturally and everyone's going to buy it why because Apple
