I think they think the first thing that people should know about in terms of broadly across the country is that suicide is a Public Health crisis around the world and end in the United States September is National Suicide Prevention awareness month so this is that really important time to make sure people are aware of how how much more awareness we need around suicide suicide rates in the United States has actually been increasing over the past two decades and it's the 10th leading cause of death for all all people in the United States. So even though it's not always talked about it in some places it don't have you and there's a lot of stigma a lot of people are dying because of suicide so that's over all across the country then for young people this is a particularly serious issues suicide is the second leading cause of death for all young people in this country and in some states for example Utah suicide attacks you the number one reason that young people diedheartbreaking every time thinking about that because we know that suicide is preventable but it it's still it's still the one of the leading reasons that you keep on and then for lgbtq young people and for your listeners may not be aware when I say lgbtq by that we mean young people that are gay lesbian bisexual transgender queer or questioning about who they are for lgbtq young people they are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers so it within this broader Public Health crisis and Public Health crisis for young people it's particularly acute for lgbtq Youth and that is why the Trevor Project existwe are really excited to bring a new series to rise together the idea of rising together has been primarily about our attempts in pursuit of an exception of relationship Rising together as a couple but we started as a different set of questions what about Rising together with people who live it unlike us what does it look like to rise together as humans what does it look like to be in community with people who are not like you we really passionately believe in doing life with people who don't look like you vote like you love like you believe like you come from the same socioeconomic background as you all the things because we are better people when we understand a narrative that is not just our own we are perpetually reaching for growth growth happens in places where you are disrupted from something that you know we are pushed away from something that maybe feels comfortable or normal for the opportunity to learn in that discomfort and so we want to introduce you in a series two stories of people who had in their life experience things that may not feel totally normal or comfortable to you and the hope is that in here bring their stories and thinking differently about life through their lens maybe it helps you as a couple to grow are really excited to talk about an organization that beat we both have been involved with for quite a long time and that is the Trevor Project the Trevor Project is an on Prophet group that's existed for over 20 years that provides Suicide Prevention education hotline so many different pieces of support to the lgbtq community the number one provider of Suicide Prevention resources in the world that true that is true it is amazing this is something that has been really close to both our hearts for a few reasons I think a lot of you know my story but if you don't I lost my older brother Ryan to Suicide it is September and September is National Suicide awareness month if you've ever lost someone in that way you understand how awful and debilitating and guarding it is but also this specific organization is important to us because we have so many people that we love and care about who are lgbtq and if you're not familiar lgbtq is lesbian gay bisexual transgender questioning queer it's all the things and we really believe in a community that loves and accept everybody and the idea that and I want to be really clear it is it is for everybody but Trevor Project mostly supports youth so I want to make clear that this is an organization that was created because children and teenagers were questioning their sexuality and rather than have to come out to parents or Community or family who might judge them for that choice they were killing themselves epidemic rate so this is something that we have supported for a long time and we lived in La we've go to The Gallows we would support financially Dave got involved with them and his work at Disney I used to volunteer when I was in events and we invited their CEO to talk to us about the organization the work that they're doing and to really give you a narrative that maybe you haven't considered before but I hope that if this is not if you ever heard the stories if you don't understand how serious this is if you don't understand that suicide is the second leading cause of death for teenagers like if you don't understand I hope that you will listen to this episode with an open heart I hope that you will put it on social media I hope you will tell other parents and other teachers about it is a conversation that we need to be having hi I'm Rachel Hollis for like 15 years and we have four kids foster parent support kids as well and we're running a business together is a lot of things do you have in your life so if you want some tips and tricks on how we get through all the things together so I will you tell listeners who you are and what you do my name is a meat Patty Leon the CEO of the Trevor Project we are the world's largest Suicide Prevention and Crisis Intervention Organization for lgbtq young people and I have been in this role for I just over two years now how's it going it's going really well so I am I am new to this role but I'm not new to the organization I started as a volunteer answering calls on her 24/7 phone Lifeline 8 years ago now so I've been involved and have loved this organization and just been continually moved by the fact that the Trevor Project stay is literally saves lives of lgbtq young people every single day and when I saw an opportunity bring my skillset and help the organization to do more of that and expand it it was just an opportunist couldn't pass up especially with the huge huge increase in demand for services over the past few years and it's important for us to say to so we have been longtime fans and supporters of the Trevor Project we have gotten the gala I remember years ago when I was an event planner meeting with your team when it was much smaller trying to volunteer to throw the annual fundraiser because I believe so much and what y'all are doing will you explain for listeners who aren't familiar with what it looks like what your services look like on a day-to-day basis and why they are so needed we actually have a number of different programs a lot of people know us fast for our 24/7 phone Lifeline that's how we actually got started 21 years ago and we still operate the country's only 24/7 phone Lifeline for lgbtq youth in crisis but it's 2019 and there are a lot of young people who would never think about picking up the phone so we also offer crisis Services via text and chat again available 24/7 expanded that service to be available 24/7 earlier this year so you know on that platform we also run another program called trevorspace which is the world's largest safe space social networking site for lgbtq youth where they can reach out to each other and get peer-to-peer support when they're in crisis when they're not in crisis when they just need someone to talk to and not feel alone and potentially know that they're not the only ones like them in the world that's what cover space is there for and then we also run education research and advocacy programs can talk more about all of those but at a high level or education programs are designed to offer lgbtq confidence suicide prevention training schools are research programs are designed to increase the amount of knowledge and evidence and research about both mental health Canada LGBT cue you and if we're a number of different initiatives in our advocacy peeing but our biggest focus is on ending the dangerous and discredited practice known as conversion therapy we run the largest Grassroots campaign to stop conversion therapy in every state in this country for listeners who don't understand why this is necessary because I I guarantee there people listening her like I don't get it why why does this exist why do I didn't even know that suicide was an it can you can you unpack that a bit of what are the statistics right now in this country I know we live in Texas there's a massive hurt here in with Texas you can you just explain the age of your collars why this exists in the first place and what they're encountering at home or at school that would put them in crisis in the first place the I think they think the first thing that people should know about in terms of broadly across the country is that suicide is a Public Health crisis around the world and end in the United States September is National Suicide Prevention awareness month so this is that really important time to make sure people are aware of how how much more awareness we need around suicide suicide rates in the United States has actually been increasing over the past two decades and it's the 10th leading cause of death for all all people in the United States. So even though it's not always talked about it in some places it's still taboo and there's a lot of stigma a lot of people are dying because of suicide so that's over all across the country then for young people this is a particularly serious issues suicide is the second leading cause of death for all young people in this country and in some states for example Utah suicide is actually the number one reason young people die but how heartbreaking every time thinking about that because we know that suicide is preventable but it it's still it's still the one don't need a reason that young people in this country die and then for lgbtq young people and for your listeners may not be aware when I say lgbtq by that we mean young people that are gay lesbian bisexual transgender queer or questioning about who they are for lgbtq young people they are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers so it within this broader Public Health crisis and Public Health crisis for young people it's particularly cute for lgbtq Youth and that is why the Trevor Project exist and make sure we can be there for every lgbtq young person if they might be in a home or people don't accept them if they might be in a community where people say that they are who they are is evil or wrong if they have somewhere to reach out to you and get support where people can tell them that they are beautiful the way they are that they are deserving of love and support and can let them know that they are not alone it's interesting because as I was finishing up my time at Disney part of how a meeting I've met originally was I walked into an opportunity to be a straight Ally for the pride group at the Walt Disney Company where the community of people who identified as being gay on campus had an opportunity to come together and represent a little of what it was like to do life and it be in a professional setting as a person who happens to be gay and as for me again like I mistakenly in almost every instance where I did not identify as the person who I was walking in the community with thought I understood what it was to be like someone who ultimately had a different life experience and it wasn't until I was immersed side of this you know opportunity to really hear what it was like to Grapple with sexuality when you're young to feel different to worry about what other people might think that I realized frankly some of the privileged that I experienced for when I realized that I like girls I don't even like it was a it was a conversation that came out of a small group with this Pride organization that I got to be a part of that made me realize the things that I never had to experience our part of why a Trevor Project exist because of the different way that processing life stages in the way that you are manifest for people who happen to be gay in the suicide statistics in particular thing that I you know I like we've been involved in charity and and work around mental health and suicide for a long time because of Rachel's brother having passed but it wasn't something that ever occurred to me and then once you understand the statistics there's this will now that you know you have to do something about it it's a crisis like you say but it's a magnified crisis inside of this community for me that the my brother committed suicide after battling schizophrenia and depression for most of his teenage life and I think the reason the Trevor Project has always had such a place in my heart is because Ryan was battling the horrible horrible mental illness for for so long the idea that a young person or any person would consider taking their life or take their life because other people didn't like who they were because they felt like they were wrong it just such a visceral response to that because God were all created in God's image and we are here for a reason and we are made this way on purpose and and the idea that all around this country right now and I want listeners to understand this in your communities right now there are teenagers who want to die because they don't feel like they would be accepted if you knew who they really were and that is fundamentally wrong on every level like these are kids and you're someone's kid I just it it makes my like Mama Bear like what are we doing how can we help what are the things that you guys have found that have made the most difference I know the call centers have been such a a huge part of what you've built the foundation on will you talk a bit about what those conversations are like I know you were a volunteer in that place for a really long time what was that like and how is that helpful to someone whose grappling with all the things I will definitely have people who obviously care so much and who are role modeling what it means to be a loving supporting member of a community at a know we need more people who are allies were coming in and saying I may not know exactly what you're going through but I'm hearing what you're sharing with me and it's helping me understand how I can be more supportive and people who are talking about young people who are paying cuz I leave there so many people who don't want to talk about suicide who don't want to talk about the shame and alien people feel and I think until we can be comfortable talking about that we can't help to direct people and get people motivated on how to change their behavior and make sure they're coming from a place of love and caring and support because that really does make such a huge difference in the lives of young people absolutely I've been answering calls I still actually take calls on our Lifeline so I've had a lot of really incredible calls I think some of the calls are some of the calls are really beautiful in the sense of their young people reaching out for the first time and saying something like I'm trying to decide if I should come out no one knows that I am gay and I think if anyone ever found out they wouldn't accept me and I just don't know if I can come out what people would say and when that's what of conversation happens we share with that young person but actually you just told me that you're gay and I want you to know that I'm incredibly proud of you for sharing who you are and I still think you're as amazing as you were when we first started this conversation and helps that it can sometimes help them to understand what it is like to share who you are and not have people react with that with that sense of head or rejection but we also have a lot of really challenging call that I remember one that I took a number of years ago from a young person who is I want you to stay but they were calling from the Midwest and their father had found out they were lgbtq and had said you're disgusting you're an Abomination before God you have disgraced the family I've left the gun cabinet unlocked leaving the house right now you know what the right thing to do you know how we always say this is not an ad this is an ad it only took us how long of shouting our love for Peloton from the rooftops and they find they were like did we just become best friends we did just become best friends and only took about 7.6 months of obsessed with their bikes I don't have a Trad but I want one like I'm here for all the things it's one of the best workouts I mean just like pound-for-pound minute for a minute you get done and you're drenched and if you like you did something with a community of humans live out in the country it was too difficult to get in and out this is super convenient if you don't understand how it could be so magical it's cuz you just haven't tried out if I get and you need to call this bike the best cardio machine on the planet and peppermint Health the hollis's are telling you that this is the best cardio machine on the planet right now is offering a limited-time offer you can have $100 off except trees when you purchase the Peloton bike and get a great cardio workout at home go to one peloton.com and he's promo code rise together to get started peloton.com and use the promo code rise together to get started also just see you now my two favorite instructors are Robin arzon and Cody Rigsby tell them Rach sencha I think West with all the progress that is made in certain parts of of the communion parts of the world there are still people who are so afraid and so filled with hatred that they could stay silent for their child to lose ended up being a very long conversation to support this young person and get them to a place where they could be safe but what I what I said to that young person part of what a civilian person which is which is what we said it so many young people that we hear from is that there may be people who don't accept you for being who you are and your father may be one of those people and there may be other people like that in your family and Community but I need you to know that there are many people in this world who will not only accept you for being who you are I will celebrate who you for being who you are and I want you to know that I am one of those people and I am incredibly proud of you and when we say something like that we just often hear no tears on the other the line because it is someone who their whole life has been afraid of rejection and then if they may have come out they may have felt and heard that rejection in the harshest way and to know that there are people in the world who see them for who they are and who accept them and celebrate them for being her there. Started messaging literally can save lives of people and said that is so it's what we do I'm on a programs when people reach out to us to let young people know that we see them and if they're beautiful the way that they are and we also try to help people and educate people. They can be that sources support for people in their lives and that there is a really important statistic that having just one supportive person in your life in reducing lgbtq Young Person's risk of suicide by 30% and I hope all your listeners know they can be that one person be that person sending love and support working people in their life to people they come across and letting them know that they're in a lie and supportive of their people who will be there for them listening to this and your suit grappling with a conversation that maybe you haven't even thought of before it's important to think of that privileged that you have never had to have someone say like I accept and love you the way that you like you never were longing for that because you always had it at and maybe there people listening her like oh my gosh I know exactly what you're talking about because I was this way because of this thing I have wished for that my entire life but if what we're talking about doesn't resonate with you that is a privilege the fact that you just got to grow up you just got to be in relationship you just got to do all of these things and you never had worried about what someone else would think of you for that or how they would treat you how they would speak to you is a privilege and in that privilege is a responsibility to show up for other people who don't have access the way that you do we walked with two of our best friends we watch with them as they came out for the first time as they told everyone that they were in relationship as we watched the church Community react to that and people who love them and and and cared about them so well on you know last week and suddenly knew something different about them now we're super hateful and we having we can't possibly understand how hard or painful that was for them but we certainly got a front row seat to just a little bit of how all of the sudden you were someone else all of the sudden all the things that we loved but you are a best friend you are sister you were this and and now I learned this one thing about you and it changed everything and it's just it's the opposite of the way that I want to live out this life and build this community we you know we're so dead set on the idea that everybody is welcome here and that there's Beauty in doing life with people who are not like you and not and not doing life with people who are not like you so that you can change them but doing life with people who are not like you because it softens the edges of your heart and it changes your perception about what the world is doing this episode their inevitable you cuz there's enough people that listen there will be people who are frustrated or upset by the fact that we're having a conversation about supporting the lgbtq which by the way to is bananas to me like this is a resource that is literally saving lives that like showing up for and loving Thy Neighbor is the tenets of why this organization exists and yet because of something that for whatever reason why they were taught the way that they believe their there's a decision that the idea that we might celebrate the saving of lives of people who identify in a certain way would give them pause for wanting to be supportive of it primarily just to me says you probably haven't been in community with anyone knowingly I mean you have been but you just don't realize you have been who's gay that would have had the opportunity because of their proximity to you to change the way that you think the stigma taboo the whatever that might be that gives you any reservation for wanting to be supportive of somebody who's doing good work to try and prevent the loss of life makes me want to pull my hair out and I hope your people are listening who might be feeling that way I think our message for them is it there may be people who have different views about policies and things in a related to lgbtq people on and I think we understand that that is the case what we hope that everyone regardless of their religious background or political beliefs or how party they belong to is the idea that every life is important every life is worth saving and lgbtq people do exist and we know that by supporting them and send sharing love and affirmation with them that we can help save lives and so I think we've actually done at the Trevor Project we've done work with religious groups and communities of Faith who don't always agree with us on every topic I need some of the work we've been doing I'm with many other partners in in Utah in particular which I mentioned earlier has a real crisis with suicide in that state DD LDS church the Mormon church has has been doing a lot of work and actually been talking and supporting efforts to decrease lgbtq youth suicide because they realize that lgbtq people and they want to make sure that they can be safe even if they may disagree with that certain people in our community about what laws and policies might be we should all be able to come from a place of hopefully love and saving lives are here do you feel heartened by what do you feel like there's a shift in Media or social that is more accepting and more loving and the reason I ask is not all social platforms obviously some of them are just an absolute dumpster fire but I recently got on Tik Tok yeah yeah it's like basically like for 12 year olds and I got on it so that I could create content that was specifically for middle schoolers and high schoolers and what I am so like I could cry I'm so blown away by the representation that I find any acceptance that I find on that platform in particular and I think it's because it's mostly run by kids that it feels like future Generations are going to be more accepting and loving then certainly when I was growing up in the 80s do you feel like that too or am I just getting served content General Arc over the past few decades has certainly been two more overall acceptance for lgbtq people and and I think you're right that minute believe that people are born inclined towards good and torque loving people and their forces that can impact that that that can generate more heat. I think that overall Arc it is is cracked and it also is true that there have been moments in the past few years were there have been very public events and and very hateful rhetoric in public that have in some cases created backlashes towards love and acceptance and that often has actually impacted some of the most vulnerable and at least understood parts of the lgbtq community in particular people who are transgender and non-binary we saw at the Trevor Project the day after the presidential election in 2016 are called volume at Trevor Project more than doubled in a 24-hour. Time from young people who just felt alone and hearing so many people in public think about taking away rights from lgbtq people were not sure if there was a place for them in this world I do believe that the overall Arc of the moral Universe Universe bends towards justice but there are clearly been setbacks and some backsliding and I think that's why it's so important for us to continue talking educating people and really encouraging people to come from a place of love and support and Karen so for listeners who here that's with a lot a lot a lot a lot of parents who listening and they are let's say they're grappling with his conversation maybe for the first time and they're trying to think of how can they better parent the Next Generation to be accepting to be loving to have those conversations I would argue that my kids are more hip and wise to what's going on in the world then I am but if you're listening to this in your parent do you have any advice of maybe you don't currently have anyone in your life who is lgbtq but you want to make sure that you're raising a generation of people who accept everybody what does that look like in 2019 and Beyond yeah I think it's such an important thing for parents to be aware of because kids kids listen to hear everything and there be another maybe and and off Off the Cuffs to Rivermark that you make using a word that is a slur or a word about we're not like those people are something negative and young people pick that up if they're not in lgbtq person they might pick that up and begin to think well if my parents think that then I'm not going to be accepting of those types of people and if they are in lgbtq person even if they maybe you're not totally aware of it at that time they might remember that comment and it might be a reason that they are not comfortable talking about who they are with you it might be a reason that they feel alone on a might be reason that they're afraid that they'll be rejected by you and all those things can put that young person at much higher risk of negative mental health outcomes and mnf's including urge parents to do is to really try to use inclusive and loving language as much as you can you know to talk about people who are different than you and how people are all people are different but all people are deserving of love and respect and making sure that you do know that you love them no matter who they love no matter who they end up being because I think it's those types of messages that have such a deep impact unit one thing I mentioned the beginning of the conversation is a lot of work we do around on ending conversion therapy we just had a study that came out of the chode that two-thirds of LGBT two young people have had someone try to convince them to change their sexual orientation or gender identity and we found that young people who undergone conversion therapy are more than twice as lead to attempt suicide as those who did not so that the idea of trying to change who who your child is or who someone is the idea of telling someone you're not valid who you are is not valid or or someone that we want to be associated with that literally leads people to to want to kill themselves that has an impact on their house and so really just urging parents and everyone to be really really careful about your language and making sure it's as loving and inclusive as possible I mean coming out of my experience with Disney I ended up getting this tattoo on my arm it says a lie and it was kind of a two-fold prompt 1 a reminder of the responsibility that comes with my privilege for having not had to think about whether I need to convince people to love me for who I am and how I was created but also I wanted to be a regular conversation starter with my for kids that I'm going to be an ally and advocate for them whether they decide to have a job that's out of the house or in the house where they end up identifying as gay or straight where they end up doing frankly whatever because imma love them and I want to make sure that they feel that love in part I wanted to create an environment that would say please be comfortable to come and have a conversation with me no matter what the thing is because you can't come to me with something that's going to make me decide that I'm not going to be a supporter of you I mean certainly you can make choices in life that I'd have to have a car station accountability wise with you but there's no I can't I honestly I can't think of something that would be a non-starter for a conversation and part of being an ally in this context or any contacts is just making them feel comfortable enough to come and be honest about what they're feeling the lot of times the people who find suicide as the option or there because they don't feel like they have someone I can go to and have an honest conversation to run I think for when it comes to losing someone through suicide always think of my dad always said about my brother like it was a it was a permanent solution to a temporary problem because everything that moment that you're feeling the emotions all of those things it is it is passing but if you have a gun that the decisions done like there is no coming back from that and so I think the ID is that like it's why I got on Tik Tok that's why I create content that specifically for this age group there is so much pain in this and we all work there right we were all in middle school we all went to HighSchool it's awful it sucks for everybody but I think if you're listening to this and you are a parent or you just care about the Next Generation and you don't understand the things that these kids are grappling with Beyond like questioning their sexuality or trying to figure out who they are the pressure of grades the pressure of bullying or popularity or being the right size are there so much pain in this age group there's so much more access to information they're on social now so not only did they get rid of that magnifies everything and now you add this thing and the Judgment of family or friends or your community and you risk the like a permanent decision of what was this beautiful life that didn't even get the chance to be what it was supposed to be so I think that it's about being in conversation with your kids I think it's about being aware of what's going on your if you I promise you your kids know more than you think that they do and this is it's it's exactly what you said it is an epidemic it's a huge huge problems will you I know except remember when y'all you and Dave talked there you were saying there are parts of a country where this is significantly more of a problem than the prices at or states where it's harder than others well I let you know that there are a difference is an overall and an overall rates of of suicide and I mentioned Utah is a state where suicide is the number one reason that young people died but it is also the case that this is a major major Public Health crisis and every single state in the country and I had something bit well this can't be a problem in New York City or in San Francisco on West Hollywood and turns out to be the case that there are that there are people in crisis everywhere and their people who feel alone and a rejected everywhere it is also the case that there are a lot of communities that you know there might be stereotype that they are not not supported places and in in even the most the places that are the most conservative the people might not expect there to be support their lgbtq people there and their parents and families there that are just filled with love and pride play children and for their neighbors and for their church members are meant for their community members and I think that's what we're trying to encourage at just after that was so moved by both of you talking about things that you do that maybe you just sort of take for granted but gave you. The fact that you are such a visible Ally I mean that you know I heard about that from our our our mutual friend Ricky stress you see the chair of the Trevor Project board if people people at Disney knew that you were an ally and I may be many of them came up and talked to you but I am very confident that there are people that you made a real difference and their ability to feel safe and comfortable out who they are that maybe never told you that maybe you never spoke to them but just knowing that there is someone who works with them someone who's successful that that that sort of messaging some of which is conscious and some of which is not those are the types of messages they have such a huge difference in making people feel supported and loved and comfortable being who they are and so I just I just want to make sure that people listening don't underestimate the huge difference that they can make small subtle things that you do in letting people know that you support them that your person that they can talk to if they're in crisis that you are support of lgbtq people that literally could save someone's life and you may not know that that happens right away you made my dad about it years later but don't underestimate the power that your words and it love can have some good thank you dang it I feel it burned my goodness which was the whole point of did you give us obviously crisis is ongoing and there are so many people that you will help but do you have stats on how many calls you taken do you have any way of kind of capturing the magnitude of the impact that the Trevor Project has had over time what we we know how many people we have been in contact with across all our different programs and platforms I mean over the years it's it's millions and millions of people that have been impacted or touched in somewhere by our work we actually we don't know how many people how many lives ultimately were saved by what we've done we we we did an independent evaluation of our programs a few years ago and scratching nervous about doing it because we never really measured how successful programs for and how they impact on these independent researchers found that 90% of the lgbtq use that we served on a crisis program saw a significant reduction in their suicidal ideation write 90% as a really really high number and intervention and they saw the. Impact not just at the point of Crisis call it up Weeks Later they continue to see that reduction and suicidal ideation so we we know that we know that the work that we do on saves lives every day and that's the worst so focused on continuing to grow and scale our program so we can make sure that every lgbtq young person knows that they are not alone and can always reach out to us for help if someone is listening and they want to get involved they want to be helpful will you tell us some ways that we can do that back to their number of ways of people are listening and want to get involved there lots of information on our website www.
