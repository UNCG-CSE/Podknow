I'm going to tell you about this book I found it's called Hitman a technical manual for independent contractors it was published in 1983 by a Colorado publisher called Paladin press just how the author Rex feral begins how I could he in good conscience reading instruction book on murder Rex feral talks a lot about how to stay Anonymous and he recommends using a fake name it's obvious he did this when he wrote his book the name Rex feral is too perfect for a literally means why he wants you to think he's dangerous so with all the Mysteries around this book the biggest one is Farrell's true identity the publisher is always protected the author their real name can't be found in court documents and it's never come out in public which is fitting because in his books he promises that he will always remain elusive that he'll never be caught but I wanted to know who would write an instruction manual for murder and why so I initially set out to find this Rex feral but the truth behind this book was so much bigger he followed it step-by-step to come in and murder my family and my brother that day so you can figure out with other books couldn't cuz you'll look out Legacy of Motown Legacy everyone who's there whatever they did good bad what they say in the ugliest you know it's all part of the Legacy got woke up in the wee hours of the morning and there's been an explosion and they located a dead body he was obviously good at concealing his identity he literally just kind of fell off the face of the Earth media this is Hitman listen And subscribe at Apple podcasts on the iHeartRadio app or wherever you listen to podcasts
