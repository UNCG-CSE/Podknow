Com bill for mobile bill for real life from wandering I'm Lindsey Graham and this is American history tellers our history your story the violent encounter between Dutch Captain Daniel van krieken back in his small party of soldiers and local Native Americans in 1626 sent shockwaves through the young colony and a warning sign back to leaders in Europe and take him back to John embroiled in a fight between the Mohawks in the Mohicans in an area that would become Albany New York the incident showed how risky and tentative the Dutch Enterprise in the new world was while England was establishing colonies to the North in New England into the south in Virginia the Dutch position themselves in between they called it New Netherland it was based on land explored by Henry Hudson 12 years earlier initially there was no Central Hub to the Dutch Colony it began with tiny numbers of settlers 6 here 10 they're setting up communities all up and down to vast region Hudson had traveled their orders were to build homes start farms and establish good relations with the natives they were spread out in the belief that this would support the Dutch claim to the region having so few settlers in any one location expose them to Danger with the killing of Daniel van krieken back in his soldiers the strategy for settlement was revealed to be flawed new plan was needed in an island in the harbor at the mouth of the river which I'm so far been overlooked suddenly became of great interest he was called Manhattan according to Legend the Dutch bought Manhattan from the local Indian tribe for $24 it's one of the most infamous land deals in history but what actually happened the significance for both parties and its lasting Legacy is far more complex this series is written by Russell shorto and based on his best-selling book The Island at the center of the world this is episode 2 buying Manhattan imagine it's January 16-24 you are an 18 year old woman standing on a small group of people in the courtyard outside your church in Amsterdam you are all wounds a french-speaking minority from a part of Europe that would later become Belgium your meeting in the church to discuss something important one of your elders lifts up his hands to get the attention of the group and makes an announcement company seeks to find willing settlers to help establish a Dutch colony in North America anyone willing to sign up will be giving free passage across the Atlantic and all the means necessary to setup settlers will be expected only to farm and trade a middle-aged man in the crowd laughs and speaks up who would be crazy enough to take them up on that go to the middle of nowhere be eaten by Savages I think the Dutch view us as a fool because we speak a different language but a young man whom you've gotten to know slightly name yoris challenges this well what's wrong with this offer it's the possibility of a new life we will loans be we have no future here I'm I'm thinking of taking the offer if he pauses and glances quickly at you if if I had a partner to share the adventure with me the others laugh they know the two of you have been flirting but you don't hear the laughter you only hear the loud beating of your heart you speak up with more Force than you intended I agree not only that the reports about the new land are very promising they say the natives are peaceful and good to trade with the land is beautiful and very fruitful it sounds like a paradise you and your ass trade glances once the crowd has dispersed and it's just the two of you he can't help himself back when you go to the New Colony will you marry me there suddenly the dangers and uncertainties of such a move come flooding into your mind and ocean passage you know is a perilous thing ships are hit by storms in her swallowed up America is an alien continent the very name evokes a black hole of wild terrorist but what's your situation here you're an 18 year old peasant girl Amsterdam is a big bustling place but it's not your home you came from a tiny village in the Woodland Countryside and you're an orphan you don't belong here you don't belong anywhere or do any want you have no definite future so you answered quickly and with conviction yes and no I will go with you but no I will not marry you there in the middle of some wild forest we will do that right here before we leave once the young couple yours rapalyea and Catalina Treecko made up their minds everything happened very quickly they were married in the walloons church in Amsterdam on January 21st 1620 for 4 days later their ship departed for America as they sailed away from Amsterdam they were leaving behind one of history's most remarkable events the Dutch Golden Age The Young Dutch nation was in the midst of an unprecedented boom wealth was flooding into the cities of Amsterdam Rotterdam and the hay and new advances were taking place in every conceivable Endeavor Rembrandt in his fellow painters were revolutionising art taking it away from the traditional religious subject matter instead pay me pictures of ordinary life and Sciences the so-called natural philosophers were looking through telescopes and microscopes and penetrating the secrets of the world around them dust control over far away territories such as the rich Spice Islands in Asia was fueling this growth in the small European nation was on the verge of even greater wealth and as part of its outward push the Dutch Nation aim to launch a new world Colony but with so much opportunity at home the Dutch West India Company could only attract settlers from the bottom rungs of society recent immigrants and minorities that we're struggling to get a foothold people like Catalina and yours they had a little stake in the golden age for them the Wilderness of America beckoned the Atlantic Crossing was unlike anything Catalina and yours had ever experienced about 30 couples and families most of them will loons boarded the ship New Netherland in early March of 1624 the captain Cornelius May steered straight South passing the coast of France and Spain and headed into the rough ER Waters of the North Atlantic passing Morocco on Route toward the Canary Islands finally he turned his sails Westward and beat a course across the Atlantic leaving all sign of land must have been a terrifying experience while the Dutch were born semen the balloons were mere Farmers menu from had never even seen the ocean before fortunately the wind was with them which made it a relatively short passage only two months in total in early may they steered into the great Harbor that form the heart of the Dutch Colony the same Harbor that had first drawn the attention of Henry Hudson years earlier but no sooner had they done so and they spotted a ship flying the French colors Captain May announce to his passengers that there would be a delay possibly a violent one he was under orders from the state's general the Dutch governing body to defend the Dutch claim to the territory Captain May communicated his orders to the friendship which replied that it was here to claim the territory for France javelina must have had a few hours with mounting anxiety has the messages went back and forth she couldn't have helped but consider the possibility that her dream of a new life in America would end before she even set foot on the continent after a while and once Captain May showed he was prepared to use his cannons the Friendship back down as the Dutch escorted the French vessel out of the harbor Catalina and you are soft firsthand the uncertainty of New World politics this might look like a Wilderness but European powers were already thinking ahead maneuvering to control pieces of it the Dutch ship continued his voyage and sail past the thickly wooded island of Manhattan and continued 150 miles up the Hudson River to a spot near the Cohoes Falls there they disembarked and rejoiced at the feel of firm Earth beneath their feet and then they got to work on their first two tasks building a fort and get a crop in the ground after the forts for vaccines were they busy themselves with constructing individual houses and by mid-summer the settlers had simple but serviceable homes in the grain they had planted was Rising high from the fields the first year or so the settlement was peaceful Serene even there was the richness of the land tomorrow lack in the wide muscular Rises of the mountains their reason for being in this location was trade the Hudson river which ran north-south intersected with the Mohawk River which went East West the West India Company had founded the colony of New Netherland as a for-profit Enterprise and its Directors Place their hopes on the fur trade your ass in Allina Health establish that trade with Native Americans who track beavers and other animals along the Mohawk River the Indians brought their pelts down river to the fourth the settlers traded for them packed them onto ships and sent them down to the southern reaches of the Hudson River then their fellow colonists transferred them to larger vessels to make the transatlantic Voyage back home and answered him the beaver pelts were processed into felt which was highly prized in Europe because it was both lightweight and warm the Dutch trading Expedition got off to an excellent start in their first full year your ass and Catalina and the other Ford Orange settlers obtain close to 500 otter pelts and more than 5,000 beavers from the natives for which they traded guns pots knives and other items of value to the local people at the same time they were busy Building Homes and planting crops they were delighted that first Autumn that their grain wheat Rye barley and oats a drone as high as a man once a floor noted and after that three ships arrived from the home country whose name's the cow the horse in the Sheep announce the precious cargo that each carried the animals grew strong in the fertile land was a bounding with grass in pasture slowly through grinding after your ass in Catalina and a handful of other stuff we're making a home out of this Rich Wildland and then you're after they arrived Catalina Norris gave birth to their daughter Sarah which was the first child of the New Colony relations with the local tribes were good to Catalina said they were all quiet as Lambs in those years ready and willing to trade the settlers learned enough of their languages compiled rough dictionaries and as they visited the native Villages the Dutch reported home what they were like the drawings are circular with a vent hole about to let out the smoke and mostly made of the bark of trees asleep on the ground covered with leaves and skins the women so skins into clothing for pear bread hook to meet Bala Manhunt with arrows the Dutch settlers became fascinated by the ways of the surrounding tribes including the organization of their society there is little authority among these nations one report said they live all equally free in East Village there is one who commands in war but wants to fight is ended his authority ceases they are very much afraid of death but when they are faced with it they are very brave the peaceful life of the first year of the settlement ended when Captain van krieken back. His Dutch soldiers entangled in the dispute between the Mohawks in the Mohicans suddenly the paradise that Catalina had dreamed of while still on the canal side Inn Amsterdam vanished into years of hard work look to be erased instead of farm animals and crops she was faced with corpses riddled with arrows and shelves of crippling fear now she and her fellow settlers were digging not to plant crops but to bury the dead as they dug the graves the settlers discuss what to do could they flee back to Europe where the Native Americans who have been so open and friendly before about to turn on them slaughter them 4 Luongo a ship arrived from the southern part of the river with news and new orders the leader of the colony had been ousted and was being sent back to the home country yours Catalina and the others at Fort Orange where to board the ship and head south it was a new leader He travel throughout the colony he understood the flaws with the initial settlement strategy and he

hire if you are some Catalina have been too busy establishing their settlement to pay much attention to events further south than the colony they had time to get caught up as I sail down the river the first director of New Netherland was a man named William verhulst and he was unpopular from the start he cheated the Indians in the area around the harbor the colonists were outraged at this because they were outnumbered by the native peoples and they depended on the whole reason the Dutch settlers were there was to trade with the Indians the men who are running the colony from across the ocean understood this as well they had given her holes to clear instructions saying that he shall see that no one do the Indians any harm or violence to see if macher scorn them in any way but that in addition to good treatment they be showing honesty faithfulness and sincerity in all Contra the settlers knew if the native peoples of the region came to just trust the Dutch they were all doomed so they set up a committee to decide what to do about their unscrupulous later and just as they were meeting the news of the violence in the north reach them ventre can back had an effect on the same thing as verhulst gotten the tribes of that up River Region angry with the Dutch settlers and people had died that news seem to push the settlers in the south over the edge they dismiss verhulst and looked about for a new leader as it happened one of the first people to come to New Netherland and the directors of the colony had assigned to her house as his assistant and just returned from a trip to the home company his name was Peter minuit and everyone felt he was smart and capable and at 46 years old a man of solid experience and a universal choice to lead them then we had traveled up and down the east coast and had developed a keen understanding of the geography of New Netherland the problem with the colony from the outset he determined was it settlement pattern because they were so concerned about the English taking over the Dutch have tried to protect their claim to the territory by putting a token Outpost in every part of it but that meant that no part of the Dutch colony had enough people to truly defend it making matters worse for Halstead done a bad job of selecting a base for the colony it was clear that the great Harbor at the mouth of the Hudson River was a natural heart of the colony but verhulst who decided that a small island in it should be the capital the Dutch called it and not Island now known as Governors Island it guarded the entrance to the Harbour so might have seen two suitable choice but he was too small to sustain a large population everything therefore needed to be rethought starting with a capital but if not Island was not the ideal location for a capital minuit recent right across from the harbor lay the southern tip of another Island man maybe for Halsted thought it was too big to defend from in we though it had all the necessary features at 12 miles long he was big enough to sustain a large population its southern tip was John it into the harbor could be defended against attack from the sea and it protected passage of the river and Into the Heart of the colony had Forest streams Wild game land that could be formed to the new Dutch leader Manhattan was a key to his Colony future imagine it's late summer sixteen twenty-six you are Native American village leader of the Muncie speaking tribe called The Witch casket you and your people use this land mannahatta as a seasonal hunting ground right now you're on the southern tip of the island with a soft flapping of the water at the Harbor's Edge behind you before you is a large Circle comprised of two groups your fellow with casket and the Dutch who came to your area two years ago the man directly opposite you mean we is making gestures to his people and then to yours extending his arms wide showing that he is a man of Honor you can be trusted the addresses you in a formal tone by this agreement we enter into alliance with your people we will age you if you are attacked and if we are attacked you will come to our assistance we will be as family we will share this island of Manhattan you then repeat the terms by this agreement we enter into alliance with your people we will Aid one another we will share this island mannahatta we offer these things as token of our understanding you hand over amount of blankets and Furs then we speaks again and we give you these as tokens of our understanding man weave man come forth and begin laying items on the ground before you copper kettles knives muskets gunpowder silk when we speaks again all of this is a value of 60 guilders in our money but that is of no consequence because these items while they are good and strong are only as good and strong as our word we will keep our work movies man in your casket people celebrated and dance long into the night you and then we shared a pipe together underscoring the bond the two of you and your two peoples have forged then at some point in your Dawn one of the white men Soldier approaches you with a question so where will you go now you don't understand oh you remain here but now that you sold the island surely you will go elsewhere to live in Hunt just as the Europeans have some understanding of your Traditions you do as well if there's you decide to address this directly we will remain here sold is one of your words on ours asked me to me he understands it will be as he said we will share and 1/2 nevertheless something interest your mind along with the man's words that foreboding the Dutch were the most literate people in Europe in the 17th century they were also highly legalistic people all transactions had to be writing but that doesn't mean they believe that with a few pen strokes and then exchange of goods they would become owners of the island of Manhattan they were great Travellers worldwide traders who took pains to understand the ways of local people's most of them knew that for the Native Americans it was no such thing as a real estate transaction in the European sense they knew that for the people of the region and arrangement for land was more of a defensive Alliance minuit especially would have understood that the plastic people were allowing the Dutch to use the island along with them and that they were promising to help each other and yet one such an agreement went beyond those two parties and was discussed among Dutchman in Europe is lost all subtlety and took on a life of its own the exact details of the so-called sale of Manhattan aren't Preserve in history noor's the deed which was certainly written and signed by I thought it said what has survived is a letter written by an official of the Dutch government to his colleagues Peter Skagen was on the dock in Amsterdam some months after the agreement was made when the ship arrived from Manhattan he wrote a letter to the directors of the West India Company in which you summarize the contents of the ship as well as the news at 4 on high and mighty Lords yesterday the ship the arms of Amsterdam arrived here are people are in good spirits and live in peace the women have also born some children there they have purchased the island manhatas from the Indians for the value of 60 guilders they've had all their drain sold by the middle of May and reached by the middle of August I sent samples of the summer grains wheat Rye barley oats buckwheat Canary seed beans and flax he went on to report the cargo the ship containing thousands of animal hides Beaver honor mink links and muskrat as well as a great deal of Timber in his report Peter Skagen reduce the complexity Arrangements that mean we had made with a wood casket people to a simple sale of land evalu the pots and knives the Dutch given to seal the deal at 60 guilders a little later on in the 19th century a translator reckon that amount at $24 and so was born in this a legend of a fabulous window in which worldly Europeans Hoodwinked the simple natives but those who executed the treaty did not see it as a simple transaction they were all Europeans and Native Americans trying to negotiate a way forward in a world that for as anyone could imagine would continue as it had been for Millennia just see sky and unending Forest and that way for both parties basically understood would have to be undertaken together the natives who sold the island surely didn't feel it was theirs to sell any way to years later when we second-in-command wrote a letter to one of the directors of the company in Amsterdam and rather casually mentioned that the island is inhabited by the old Manhattans documenting that the natives didn't go anywhere after the sale in fact he noted where the local Indians plant corn and that they live in a constant state of Amity with the Native American tribes on the mainland so that they prefer to stay on the island this little tribe share the island peaceably with 42 another report back to the home country and yet there were signs of future trouble some Dutch settlers view their Native American neighbors with suspicion repulsion the natives are always seeking some Advantage by thieving send another report and a minister who was sent to the colony was blunt in his feelings as to the natives of this country I find them extremely Savage wild stranger to all decency on civil and stupid as Garden poles proficient in all wickedness and godlessness devilish man who serve nobody but the devil they are all together in human while there were those in the colony who had befriended Indians founded know them intimately father has had the lowest possible views of them and this ministers report didn't bode well the Dutch had Ambitions for the colony and their Investments to protect nuance and subtly would not hinder their Enterprise American history tellers is sponsored by Sleep Number we all know the

settlement Peterman we decided at the southern tip of Manhattan Island would become the capital of the colony the new city of New Amsterdam the central structure was to be a Ford wasn't very impressive for outer walls built a mound of dirt that people routinely complained Pigs Would route into and Destroy but slowly it went up inside where Barracks for soldiers and just be on the 4th the first row of houses wind up looking out onto the harbor there was a warehouse where the Furs were kept while they're waiting to be sent to Europe there was even a canal just like in Amsterdam the town was laid out in a regular pattern 16 streets and all the new Homes and Gardens behind them one of the first was built by Catalina and yours they purchase land on Pearl Street around the corner from the fort the records of the colony show them growing in their lives along with the colony buying a milk cow borrowing money buying Farmland cross the river in the village of brokelyn in time they had 11 children Sarah their first we've been born up River with Mariah tobacco planter attended his crop in an area of Manhattan that would later be called Greenwich Village Sarah and her husband would have a children and in fact yours in Catalina would eventually become a kind of Adam and Eve of Dutch Manhattan their offspring's offspring would continue to multiply until over a million people could trace their roots to this couple tied the knot at the balloon Church in Amsterdam and how to ship to American settlers like Catalina and yours came to known Manhattan intimately heading northward they followed the Indian Trail leaving the city and plunging immediately into Wilderness areas that would later become the most Urban anywhere on Earth were for the settlers at the time places to hunt or the Stop and gather fruit the ground near the river is covered with strawberries once after noted which grows so plentifully in the field and one can lie down and eat them near the exact center of the island was a little stream where they could stop to fish and the settlers name the Indian Trail that ran the length of the island to Heron bag with a gentleman's way later to be called Broadway as those first years flew by more and more settlers arrived because life was still good in the Home Country many of their Rivals were from ethnic minorities people who like Hatley and yours were left out of the economic boom at home polls Danes Scandinavians Turk and Italian Manhattan was becoming a place unlike any other a multi-ethnic port for all sorts of languages could be heard and religions practiced religion and attitudes toward it was becoming a defining feature of the colonization of America in Europe he was a great age of religious Warfare when religious intolerance was official policy in most places as Nations competed to get ahead aligning people around a shared religion is often an essential strategy religion was such an inch Gary Force it stood to reason that a society comprised of a mix of different face could only dissolve into chaos in France and Spain for example religious intolerance was considered good policy the same was true in England which was why Christian sects that wanted to break from the church of England went elsewhere in search of new homes while the Dutch were settling Manhattan the English Puritans shows their own colony in America in New England as a shining City on a Hill their New Jerusalem there they would have the freedom to follow their structure form of protestantism alongside them in England or another religious sect the pilgrims were in fact a break away from the Breakaway they thought the Puritans didn't go far enough in the reforms and they to left England but they went first to the Dutch provinces which everyone knew was tolerant of different faiths these pilgrims spent 12 years in the Dutch city of line but a group of them left for America because ironically of the very tolerance that had initially attracted them in Leiden their children mingled with people of other face in the pilgrim parents didn't like that the Dutch policy of Tolerance it come about in part because the Dutch provinces are flat that's easy to invade or flee to giving Dutch cities large immigrant populations secondly the Dutch found that tolerance was actually good for business it helped fuel the golden age in North America New Amsterdam also enjoy the fruits of this liberal attitude toward religion there was always an element of chaos about the place but it was functioning with its mix of peoples Peter minuit felt good about his City and his colony and its success and he wanted to reach out all of the Dutch in New Amsterdam knew that the English pilgrims set sail from Leiden to the Plymouth Colony just a few hundred miles to the north and so many we decided it was time for them to visit imagine this March of 1627 un ambassador from New Netherland sailing into the port of New Plymouth home of the pilgrims here
