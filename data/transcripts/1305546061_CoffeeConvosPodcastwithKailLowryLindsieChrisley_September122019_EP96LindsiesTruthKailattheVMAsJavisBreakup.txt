hey guys welcome back to another episode of coffee convos podcast Highland be like I haven't talked to you in forever it's definitely been a hot minute but not on podcast not on the podcast yeah and you were always texting on RBS everyday but I'm just saying Mike about stuff it just feels brand new right so where do we start because honestly that has week without no takers.what is the last week kicked my ass so hard that I was truly like there has to be a rainbow after this horrible storm like there has to be my no with Becky was great I mean you know she would highly requested a night you know what I was sad that you weren't there because I really wanted it to be the first time I had first of all I would had wanted her to be on the podcast with you in person and that's why I think that yeah even though she was very highly requested I was putting it off because I wanted us all to be together for it but it didn't work out that way so I told her that maybe the next time we were saying you got you can come here and we can record in person because I really want you to meet her jobless Ryan Road and from what I heard it was funny and I had posted like all the stuff on the Instagram everything in obviously everybody loves Becky From what I understand she's turning straight women into possible lesbian so I'm just I just watched her all to a Latino around her I don't a lot of people were talking about I'm like really funny stories that came through about people who'd actually crash weddings before and I was just like what in the actual hell is Billie Holiday's what am I reading right now because I didn't get to listen to the entire episode about like 20 minutes and so I'll keep you updated on what I think about it but I was like what it was like being by yourself cuz I haven't why did it with Katie Moore in for one episode but I'll right there and I think Susie might have been there for that episode too so my first time and it was my first time doing like go behind-the-scenes work for it to like we wrote to notes so I was like I just kept typing and typing and Diana was like okay this is not I'm not doing this right so I would like check for me after I did because I was like what the fuck am I really supposed to be typing here like what am I typing so I texted Adam and I'm like I feel like I'm literally just doing like you know when you go to court and you say type every single thing that's sad and everything that happened my God episode so it was fine I'm so glad for all the people that commented under that post their ready for me to come back I was ready to come back to but obviously like my life was a whirlwind last week actually for like the past two and a half weeks I guess it's been so I'm going to let kill talk about her nonsense of stuff that went on last week and then we can kind of get like more into that honestly though I think it really life hit you hard like so fucking hard and then on the tail end of that I got hit in the face with with baseball bat basically so at least that's what it felt like I was first lie and I went to the VMAs and when we got there we both ended up with strep throat I don't know how we didn't make out in Chiang so I pick her up from the airport on Sunday we driving to the city Monday morning we both wake up and we're like oh my God we have strep throat so then we get start getting ready and I sit mind you I had no outfit for this fucking event and sit down in the chair for hair and makeup and Evette calls me and they had bear since Saturday so I knew they thought okay we'll keep them for a couple nights here monitor his progress got really sick on Saturday night and I was like okay well if they're going to keep him regardless I might as well go to the DMV because I was unsure at first because I didn't know how long they're going to keep him or whatever and they said they were keeping him regardless so I was like okay well I might as well go cuz sitting at home I'm not going to it's not going to do anything so right I sit down in here and make up on Monday are you have strep throat still don't have an outfit for this fucken event and I got a call from the vet and they're like bear has a big Mass on his spleen and he also has gastroenteritis so that is inflammation of the stomach large and small intestines and so that explains why he basically had uncontrolled bowel movements for the past week and I couldn't figure it out I thought maybe he was mad at me but I know that sounds so dumb but if you have a dog sometimes you think okay well you know I was really busy this week I didn't get to take you on as money walk so I didn't get to you know spend as much time with you so maybe he's or maybe I'm just missing him having to go outside so I thought I don't know

going to help like it's not going to do anything so but on the other hand he can basically collapse at any moment and bleed out so I'm just crying and they're filming this they're filming all of it because they're filming me and Leah in the city together for the VMAs and I'm like what the actual fox sound like I'm not going to do the surgery if it's not going to benefit him long-term I mean he's only seven and a half and they're like a weekend like right, for if it's not going to really do anything so then I'm like What's another option they said we can check with an ultrasound in two weeks I said well if I'm altimate we not going to do the surgery it doesn't make sense to then do the ultrasound because I mean at the end of the day we are talkin about money here and I've already spent just to have him in the vet from Saturday until 2 until Monday was 4400 banana surgery would be another three to four thousand and then on top of that if I was to not do the surgery and then do the ultrasound it would have been the visit plus the $400 ultrasound but he would be so uncomfortable and in pain in note for those two weeks until ultrasound if he even made it to the ultrasound so came home God I'm just about to cry oh my gosh don't cry it was it was rough but I mean I guess hindsight I say this every fucking episode I swear to God is always 20-20 I looked back and I was like all the signs that he was showing that I miss and I thought that it was something else I felt horrible and I already had a vet appointment scheduled for Wednesday at 12 cuz I wanted to confirm cancer heat I found a growth on his leg and I was like okay I am something is something's not right so I already had this vet appointment a regular vet appointment not emergency vet and so I called of that back and I was just like this isn't going to be we have to put him down like this isn't going to be to confirm cancer this is because he has cancer and he's in pain and he needs you know he couldn't get up off the floor on Friday on Saturday night that's why we took him I was at the vet until 3 a.m. ended up keeping them but so long story short I'm dragged so as long as I have we had to put Bear Down on Wednesday last Wednesday so it's been almost a week without him and it's just been really hard I never thought he was my first dog I ever had and I don't feel like he was here long enough for me and I don't think seven and a half years was that long and I am basically explained it to the kids I asked them you know did they want to be there do they have any questions and they all said that they won't two out of three said that they wanted to be there so I said okay I'm not one to sugarcoat things and I want to explain life to my kid life and death to my kids in an honest way and have an open dialogue about it and so they were both really upset and then they came they came to the vet and I held Bear all the way through it and they chose to stay in the room all the way up until they started injecting him so I thought he was really really brave for that and it was just I was difficult it was really really difficult so that's where we're at after that I was hospitalized and they thought I had fucking meningitis but it turned out to be literally that breaks my heart it was Lindsay I was making like the worst the weirdest noises ugly crying so fucking hard like it was I don't think that anyone could have prepared me for and they even asked me there and are you sure you want to be in the room for this and I was like this is my dog like this is my child this is my room so I didn't understand why they would ask me did I want to be in the room of course I wanted to be in the room but then it when it was happening I was like oh my God and I couldn't stop upon the Cry of apologizing to him because I felt like I missed the signs you know and I I feel like he was in pain for a lot longer that I knew and I just did because he's a dog I mean I just didn't think that it wouldn't happen either way that is coming home and you know bear was my eyes and ears when I was asleep by myself Chi-Chi always bark there was anything even a shadow and I sometimes as frustrating as it would be like if the baby was sleeping or something it would it's been really weird I'm the last night before we put them down I knew that we were putting him down and next day at 12 so I let him sleep in my bed which I don't ever do I let him sleep in my bed and I didn't sleep the whole night like I'm pretty much tossed and turned all night and just like knew what was coming but we are we are a week almost a week later and I try to sound so matter-of-fact about it because it is what it is at this point but I mean it's bad I didn't think I would I guess I didn't know what to expect been hard but I think it is hard to because he's been through so much with you like since Isaac spend a baby so I think you know like you look back on all of your memories and he's a part of like all of your memory so it really is like what you know the part of your life that's not there it's so crazy though because we moved into the house about a month ago and right before we moved into this house I had bought Bear all new stop near and Gizmo I bought them both all new stuff new leashes new dog bowls new crates new beds knew everything and so and it was so weird because when I was putting Chris help me put the crate together and they come with the big ones for the big big dogs they come with a divider so like when your crate training your puppies they changed it if I'd rather you go and I I don't know why but I told Chris I said don't throw the divider away and put it in the box and keep the box I don't know why I said that and I always thought you know when there goes I'm not getting another dog I'm not doing it because you know it's just it's a lot and I and I don't think that I could attach myself to another animal the way I did to Bear but something told me to keep the divider keep the Box keep everything and it was it's almost like the universe Was preparing you yes like preparing me like okay you say you're not going to get another dog but eventually you will end this is like Bears breaking in all the new stuff to them pipes pass the torch you know what I mean so that way when I get another one you know everything's pretty it's a little bit broken in just enough you know so I feel I feel like that's that's what I needed I didn't sleep the night that you went to the vet because I kept like waking up like sporadically like texting you I felt I would like some type of like psycho in the night you know like I was like fall asleep and then I would like to catch myself falling asleep and I wake up and I feel like text Cale like everything fine like what's going on but I'm proud of you it's that's a hard thing to go through and I haven't been through it so I can't speak on it but I'm sure there's a lot of people there listening who have been through it and probably share similar experiences with you and I'm proud that you let your kids be involved because I'm so weird we talked about it on the podcast with Brittany that I'm really weird about death and like permanent things and right if I don't do funerals myself and I just I don't do death well so I try always Shelter Jackson from it now yeah and I think it is a very weird thing to talk about and I feel like unless you have to are directly affected by it like how do you even open that Converse bike how do you even open the doors for that conversation so I felt like and I thought I was getting different opinions from people like some people are like oh you know tell the dog that you tell him tell them that the dogs going to heaven and then another friend was like you know be open and honest with you with them you know whether some people believe in heaven some people don't but I wanted to be as honest as I could and in what I believe and I know that maybe my kid's dad don't believe the same thing but I explained it to them from my point of view and I asked them do they have any questions and they kind of said no like they knew I basically said that they're going to they're going to make this best shot and when you are in pain and suffering when a dog is in pain and suffering or any animal you know they they inject them in it kind of just they put them out and then they die and an income heart of the universe and that's and that's what it is and they don't come back after that you know but we have the memories and they didn't have any questions like they didn't ask me anything and I was almost like today not care or is it they understand or I don't I don't really know but it went to press that cuz if they're not asking questions I don't want to see you know what I mean I think you have to kind of like taking in stride and like when they ask questions like when the questions, that's what the answer them but obviously like I said very hard to go through and we talked about Donald being sick on the podcast for but it was nothing like life-threatening but honestly like in my head I went through the state of how would I explain as like if something goes like South really fast like how how do you explain explain so I'm so glad that you were able to share and I don't want you to cry the whole podcast but I'm good I just really quickly to touch on that I the one thing I was afraid that they were going to ask me is do they do this to people right that was something I was like okay I was just hoping it didn't ask because I didn't have to explain it to write what I have to explain it like literally but anyway moving on we are we don't have to be sad the whole podcast tonight there's a ton of like good stuff and other stuff that you're going through that we should talk about and but that was my experience with bear and stuff like that we're praying for you when people who pray I'm sure they are fine cuz I saw a lot of people like sending messages and comments and stuff so we love you but we can move on so that you don't have to practice ask yes just feel like their new body care products they're launching every single day that were exposed to have because you have so many choices your best bet is to look for products that have been vetted by experts. I ran across Flamingo and access their tested and trustworthy and I'm just so happy about it so don't know about flamingos they make body care for women with hair great razor shave gel and body lotion the works by a group of women at here and who realize they were only using men's razors because there wasn't an option that felt right for them and I can totally relate because I use men's razors before Flamingo as well can be such a chore and that's okay because the flamingo shave set is anything but routine it's a $22 value but for you it's $16 with free shipping and it has all of the essentials that I need inside the pouch and because if I travel I just threw everything in there and never forget anything so think about it you probably said more $16 on razors and Blades already with a flamingo shave set you can upgrade for less or the same as you're paying now including the parts that you skimp on like shave gel and exfoliating lotion and they even send you a shower holder which is my favorite Flamingo Shades that features the award-winning products for just $16 and it ships free directly to your door if I were you I tried the flamingo shapes that it's a $22 value for just $16 with free shipping today when you visit shop flamingo.com coffee that's right visit shop flamingo.com coffee so tell me about the VMAs we didn't have outfits we waited until last minute and when we were there we Miss Missy Elliott's performance and we had strep throat so as far as I'm concerned I had no business being there absolutely not. I shouldn't have even showed up to be perfectly honest with you like call Haley posted something about how we were bras yeah are like how you had like fashion mishap or like something I forget like the way that you like put it we did we definitely look at yourself and professional photos and you're like what the fuck was I doing like it would have been good if we were going to a club or something and the pictures made me look like I had a grandma Hill on like the one-inch heel you know and they were like really they were really like 4 inches or 5 inches so I was like wow this is not bad I call those chodes and like I can't wear them they look like Grandma ones and I was terrible Honestly though it was a flea and I can look at ourselves and laugh like people were comparing me to that who is the girl that played in A Cinderella Story the mom to stepmom my mom and I was just like I got ourselves so much for the next award show so I'm not worried and honestly it's just like a joke like we have strep throat we showed up to the amazing bras like fuck it what else can go wrong like I don't even like she was in Atlanta last time she was like want to go to the VMAs I'm thinking of myself like I'm the type of person that I have to have like the perfect outfit like I would have to have like tailoring and like everything like Done Right till is type person that doesn't know what the fuck she's wearing until like 3 minutes before she shows up kurento that's terrifying to me and it's also terrifying to me that I could possibly be put on some type of like in some type of magazine of like worst dressed like that that's more too fine to me so absolutely not to be perfectly honest I'm glad it was you and Leah because y'all can take that in stride and I can't so I mean yeah it was pretty bad but at least you're comfortable while we were sick you know 100% so then I'll miss call 911 to your house yeah I think we should because that was a shitshow also this is all one pic by the way this is literally all in one week in a section 7 Day like time. You guys this isn't like just things that have happened in life collectively over like the past couple of months this is literally within like 6 days so I was texting kale and normally like I know her patterns and I know like when she's going to text back or if she's like to sleep or whatever so I've text her like a million things and she hasn't responded and I'm like okay something's not right and then I tagged her in something on Instagram and that bitch is always checking Instagram so I'm like she hasn't seen it yet so like obviously she hadn't been on Instagram or else she would have looked on Twitter and like so haven't tweeted anything stupid so I'm I like where is she so then at this point like normally I would not contact kills assistant to like aggravate her with something unless it was like super serious so at this point like I'm at an appointment it's like around 11:30 about to say sorry I'm late cuz I could have lunch time yeah she's not still sleeping like she's dead yeah basically was I text your sister and Kristen have my Kristen something's wrong like where is kill all the sudden Kristen text me back like on speed and she's like 20 minutes from her house going as fast as I can and I'm like I knew something was wrong I was like that's it I'm calling nine-one-one and she was like loving hauler am I see if she answers the phone so then Kristen text me back and she's like I told Kayla that you've literally she's literally free to the fuck out and she said that like she can't see and she has like pain down her spine I start like acting like I'm a physician at this point and I'm like oh my God she has meningitis and strep and her spine and like she's she's dying does it go in your spine I don't know like I made this up like I literally thought you were. I was in so much pain all night long I have this it literally I had every single fucking symptom of meningitis and I knew that I had had Mono pretty recently liked in the last couple months and then I also had strep and then I have this like migraine that literally when I tell you like I'm not exaggerating I know I can be dramatic I know but this time like Chris had come and he had taken the kids and you took him to his aunt's house and it was so bad that I truly was like they're swell am I brave there's something wrong like there was so much pain and I couldn't I like couldn't hear sounds and he sounds made me like literally just like want to cringe and I just wanted to cry and it was so so bad when I started feeling it all down my spine and into my lower back and I was like I have meningitis but I for sure do so Kristen actually showed up here and came and she had the key to my house so she came in and she's like kale and I'm still in bed at like 1:30 in the afternoon like I could not get out of bed it was so bad she took me to the hospital and everything shit if you're 20 minutes away you're about to be 3 minutes away like speed up and also if I had 911 dialed on my phone so I was just about to click the other wine and call and be like we need a wellness check on this person at such-and-such address because she has not looked at her Instagram or her Twitter or she has not texted back this line for an Instagram wellness check yeah like I have his so concerned and then finally text me back and was like you know doing these tests and then Chris and I are texting back and forth about like how they might possibly do a spinal tap on you but we weren't going to tell you and let God she told me that and it when she told me that I was like no I refuse I refuse the spinal tap know we were like Christian was like but I'm not going to tell her I was like yeah good idea like don't tell her like I felt like such a bad person like coming up with all of these things like behind your back and like diagnosing you, so I went down the rabbit hole to like the first thing everyone said was meningitis so I was like oh my God so I'm down this rabbit hole on Google like WebMD and I'm like self-timer yes like I'm self diagnosing myself and I'm sure they are telling me that this is just possibly a migraine and I'm like okay first of all if this is a migraine and people get these regularly I don't know how people are functioning and doing life when I literally didn't get out the bed for over 24 hours and I could not function like my kids eat I had to give Lex a bath the night before when I was giving him a bath and it's hearing the water running I literally wanted to die first of all I will tell you I saw him yesterday and you were like I don't want to go to the ER and these people think that I'm coming here for a headache yes that's what exactly what I thought that's exactly what I said to them imagine how many things you can do in the time that it takes to go to the grocery store and like sit in the parking lot in like actually mentally prepare yourself to go in the store because that's me every time I have to go to an actual store anyway what would you do with all that time so at the mom I love taking as much time as I can with my kids so every minute counts and probably laid everything so that's why we love instacart I use instacart now because it's just like the grocery store so busy they never not have enough people on the register and add time to something that you think is going to take 20 minutes so I just like

I think Jackson was like to have been three I'm pretty sure he was too though but I felt like I had a migraine for like weeks at a time and I wouldn't be able to see and at the time I was going to the chiropractor a lot and I know there's like mixed reviews some people love the chiropractor some people hate chiropractor but I was going cuz I didn't car accident and so somebody had rear-ended me and I had whiplash and it was just very bad situation so I did not know that I'm so sorry yeah I was actually on the way to the airport to go to Nashville to film the driver who picked me up from the house we were sitting on the freeway at like 5 in the morning and some truck that was carrying like heavy-duty equipment on it never stopped plowden backblast everywhere like all over me it was it was a disaster like my Louis Vuitton was ruined it had like two flakes all over it it was clearly a disaster so basically like I go to the chiropractor they tell me my back is all twisted up and so I start getting these adjustments and then I start getting these what I thought were migraines which I think they were migraines but I wouldn't be able to see am I because I felt like I was making sure they won't take you seriously just like I would even tell Will I like like this is it like I'm dying and so I went to the ER and I told him I was going on immediately when I told him that I've been seeing a chiropractor they start doing CT Scan they start doing like all this stuff so wait why I don't know I've never been to a chiropractor so I don't know I think because like medical doctors like don't think like Chiropractic is like medical or something like that so they say like don't do it but I love him car part time to be honest so anyway they start doing all these scans and then come back in and you know it's like the worst ever when I come back in and they give you like a referral to a specialist like that's the worst so they come back in and give me a referral to a neurologist do the same thing to me they gave me Toradol Compazine Benadryl and then suddenly gave me a referral to a neurologist and I'm just like I first of all I was already skeptical that anyone was like around me would believe me but luckily Chris believed me like this he truly did he was trying to get me to go to the ER all night but I don't I just don't think that they would have done anything like I'm they didn't they gave me three drugs that I don't even know what they do I had to look them up and they're not even for migraines like they're like four other things that I guess also like help with a migraine so I'm like I'm not going on a neurologist like I'm not doing that I want to know what is the cause why did this happen to me and is it going to happen again well I guess your ologist would tell me that yeah I was literally so freaked out whenever they came back at and we're like they basically just tell you they're kind of like done with you and like you have to go to like this specialist and then like this make sure you send us a message if you've ever been through this because literally when they send you to a specialist or that the recommendation they pretty much like don't do anything else so it's like that's where like their service basically stops and so then you have to this was like over a weekend for me so I had to sit on this for a weekend and then call the special as it was like 2 weeks before I could get into a specialist they actually had ordered an MRI for me so it had to go and have an MRI which is really scary and then the MRI place send the results to the specialist and I had to go for the specialist to read it and so I forget what it was called whenever I was born unless you have had an MRI like you wouldn't know that you had this but sometimes like when you're developing spinal fluid can like get on your brain at the very bottom of my brain there is like a little bit of spinal fluid so I don't know if that could have been infected like when I was having these adjustments are not and a neurologist said that they really don't know like it's not like life-threatening it's not something like it something I've lived with for my whole life like literally since I was developing like I've always had so it was nothing new but it was kind of scary to know that like I'd had something it was like a little abnormal right so I don't know what to expect yeah but I would be I think you definitely should go to the neurologist okay well I mean I definitely will I think I threw out the referral but I'll definitely call back I just left lay of course you did I can I can just call back and just ask for saying you know can I have it but I just I don't I still have the spine pain like even right now as I'm speaking I don't know where the back pain is coming from yeah that's like freakish but I will tell you you do live like a very crazy life so I think that maybe like I'm not going to try to act like I know how to diagnose something but you're always saying yesterday like we had a chill day like took Jackson to Skyzone literally had dinner a bath and was watching TV by like 5:30 afternoon so like that's more like borderline Grandma so I think if you like tried to scale back a little bit like did a little bit less stuff and the amount of time that you do things in then you might like feel better cuz I sometimes feel like you can bring sickness on yeah cuz you're you get like overwhelmed but that's just honestly a personal opinion I don't know if there's like really any true no I do not anytime I'm not a person that functions well off a little sleep but lately I've noticed like I've had strep throat 3 times in the past 6 months and every single time it's after a long weekend of no sleep yeah I don't know if it's a coincidence or not but it's like running myself so thin or like just not you know what I mean and then I get sick whether it's a could be anything like even now I feel like I'm like stuffy my post nasal drip pill and I haven't been sleeping so it's like I don't know I'm not sure but the back pain a little weird I don't know never really had like severe back pain okay so Lindsey you know what I love using lately what I love using New Ulm because I feel like this move has helped me transition until like making Lifestyle Changes everywhere and Noom helps me like get in shape but also just like do better to do better habits and I just keeping track of my body and I love it I think it's it's been really awesome to use in this last couple months maybe that's why you've been in a better mood honestly like I'm glowing I'm radiating I've I think it's new I love it so y'all if you have specific goals that you want to cheat you can do that with noon and it's not just losing weight so you know better self-care feeling confident and clothing have more energy or just you know like an overall glow or if you want to make healthy choices that deals with yourself have you no better mood control Stress and Anxiety new is so great so can help you break habits and I think that kind of goes back to what I was saying and healthy no create better ones so it just super easy and convenient use of the app so Noom is a habit changing solution that helps users learn to develop a new relationship with food through personalized courses so that's why it's different from everything

Com coffee what do you have to lose visit noom.com flash coffee to start your trial today that's noom.com coffee the last weight loss program You'll Ever Need we've just been on The Struggle Bus for like the past at least two and a half weeks kill probably for like the past twenty something years but I've been on the struggle by as like I boarded it two and a half weeks ago and I haven't gotten off yet and I don't like her so you don't even know how you're holding up because I feel like you got hit so hard with so many things and so publicly honestly you want to talk about it like what's your question I'm here for you I'm not pressuring you to talk about anything you don't want to but let it be known that I truly don't know how you're still doing it ask me whatever you want and if I can't answer it then I can't but if I can then then I will cuz I want to be honest okay I mean we're not. I mean I guessed as all of us know we seen the media and we saw that your parents were getting indicted for 12 or so pounds of how many tax evasion criminal activity I don't even know yes like two and a half weeks ago that all went down and before I even get started I just want to say thank you to every person that has sent me a message whether it be good or bad because I'm not the type of person and I talked about this before like I don't really block people all opinions are welcome if you want to try to hurt my feelings that's fine I'll probably read it feel a bit indifferent and then move on about my life it's okay I get it like there's more than just like one person's opinion and it's always not she know the same opinion that I share so I'm okay with that I've received mean messages I've received nice messages and that was you know expected I will say that as far as my parents legal things I'm not really going to get into that other than the fact that it had been reported through my biological Brother Kyle that I had something to do with it and without going into bashing any specific individuals I know what I've done and what I haven't done I have no problem owning things that I have or haven't done however I will not own something that I didn't do for the sake of media to take the heat to do you know like whatever the agenda was like I'm not going to take on responsibilities that doesn't belong to me you shouldn't have to I had nothing to do with my parents Federal indictment to be perfectly honest the years that were covered in the indictment most of those years I was not in communication with my parents so a lot of the years or Mike early on that they covered I was in college so I wasn't even like living at home, I don't know if I've shared you know my whole story or not but through college I didn't talk to my parents so I definitely like what if had no knowledge of anything in the later years they were covered I believe that I was like already leaving the show so I also wouldn't had any knowledge of this like some of that stuff either so I just find it a little ironic that there is some Blame Game things going on and I just really had no involvement and now but then after that whole world wind came out and literally my TV's had to be off at my house for if they're still off because I'm terrified of like what's going to be put on there we have little eyes and ears around here you know so you can't be having things fast did that he could potentially like he's he's smart you know so he will pick up on those things right so immediately I realized that this was going to be a media circus so I contact my attorney and ask if it's okay if I put his email on my Instagram because I didn't want to be answering any of these questions especially like questions for things that I didn't have anything to do with so then he gets a call or email or something like that from TMZ stating that they had obtained a police report from my County would I like to make a comment on so he calls me and tells me that I need to come into the office because you know this is information that he's received so I go to his office and realize that the next whatever for seeable future is going to be hell because now this police report is out there and then the next thing I know my dad's out making statements that I had had extramarital affairs with two people and then actually gives names of people so just to cover up to that point I have been on the receiving end of all of this and for a person that is I have tons of people there supporting me over all platforms but you do get some bad messages and those sting a little bit more than the good ones you know you could get like that and then like one bad one but for people to expect that I'm not going to stand up for myself that I'm not going to speak my truth that I'm not going to come with the facts I don't really know what to say because I'm not just going to allow somebody to go out there and do that and then not respond does that make sense I think I'll go ahead I don't even know why that would be a logical fall okay guy so let me tell you about this

like characters I'm not really sure how to put it in so they feel like they're entitled to give an opinion where they don't necessarily need to or that you know concerns them I'm not really sure how anyone whether they love your family in the show or not I don't know how they can look at the situation and send you a bad message because at the end of the day which you know I stand behind you 110% even if it was you that did it which I know it's not that turn them in it's like they're the ones that committed the act in the first place so how would I don't understand that mentality or for example for the extra marital Affairs like I mean did they look into every little detail of your marriage and decide that you weren't separated or that you actually did these things like they don't even know if there's actual printing on him saying like it the whole situation is so crazy to me while it is very crazy because you know Dan you go down the rabbit hole of he's gone out here and made these statements to the media himself quoted start giving dates that was not the smartest thing to do because if anybody knows me knows these records I know that I'm pulling out if I have to so I started pulling out receipts last week on Twitter of tweets that what happened in 2017 which is kind of like where it all started and when when I had left the show and you know I just really don't appreciate it I don't think that the statements that were made were in good taste like what led me to this point I also was sent screenshots of comments and photos from chases Instagram page where he had intentionally cropped me out of photos and then the caption was like family or you know something like that which is good and great like that's fine if that's how you feel but also be mature enough to realize that since I left the show I have not gone in aired in laundry at all very well could have you could have you could have literally put anybody on blast and you never did so like The Vig Tweeds the taunting Tweeds the low blows of cropping you out of family photos like childish and it really speaks more about them unfortunately it dies speak volumes about character and then I was sent a screenshot of a comment that was made under the photo that I was cropped out of that stated that he only had one sister and that was tonight so you know obviously people were going on there and there was very mixed reviews you know there was some people on there saying like you're bad or like you know you're a bad person or are you know like whatever it was and there was like some good ones on there and the next thing you know the comments are muted because kail and I were going to go and put her two cents on there definitely try the comments were muted and the next thing I know after I have been bashed in the media and been on the defense of things giving accurate statements of what actually was you know going on in my truth my truth I will say the truth because that's not the truth for Chase to go to People magazine and to say that he loves his sister he doesn't understand why he's doing that at that point my attorney then brings out the comments that he has receipts of that he had just previously made on Instagram days before that that the only have one brother then he only has Grace and he doesn't have Kyle's not his brother than either cuz he wasn't in the family photo well so then that leads me to my next thing so then there was a photo posted of Kyle in hospital bed on Instagram and I had gone on Twitter and probably in bad taste had put something about how they were using it for sympathy how I felt and I will stand by that like I do feel that way so looking at the picture that's how I felt and I don't even know them so I mean I don't know people can say well chills only saying that because you know her Lindsey Runner podcast together but if anybody listen to spawn cast you know that we'd disagree called it on 99% of the time so is it really that much everything I 797 but then the next thing I know is running cryptic tweet that I had posted like saying that he was flexing a sympathy card and you're getting like all of these comments are people saying you know like family this family that the like let's not forget what's been done to me in the media and what has literally wrecked my life for the past two and a half weeks and I will gladly say that all of the people that were involved that were accused basically from the statements that were made from the Chrisley Camp have stood by me my husband has stood by me because we know what the truth is we don't have secrets so unfortunately for them but fortunately for me because I live an honest life we have been able to I won't say seamlessly but we have been able to move on and get past the fuckary right and it doesn't take away the fact of the actual issue at hand which is the legal issues and those are none of my business so I'm not going to speak on those right but that's what they need to be focused on and not merging into my lane I mean just to your point I think that it was very distasteful some of the things it was almost like we're in trouble so let's throw this and this and this and this at Lindsay and then take the heat off a bus but at the end of the day the legal troubles are still there so maybe don't do that because at the end of the day you're going to be still facing jail time so created pissed off person and I'm not going to say like I'm there in a mean you're going to like whatever they want to make it out to be to like make it look a type of way I have nothing to do with your life and they have nothing to do with my life Jackson hadn't seen my dad since 2017 so it's literally like two different lives and we share the same last name and I'm also going to touch on that because the people that have gone on the defense for them are saying well if you're you know ashamed of them are if you're this earlier that then change your last name first of all people said that one thing clear yeah let's make one thing clear we all went in this together so no my dad was like this A-list celebrity and then all of a sudden like we came out of the woodwork and we are benefiting off of this last name that wasn't the scenario at all in fact it took all of us to collectively sign the contract to start the reality show so that was my born name and I plan to keep it you don't like it too bad to fucking bad I mean that goes for anybody but I mean that's like oh well you don't if someone were to come up to me and say well you never even leave at your dad one time and you don't fuk with him so you should change your last name it's like fuck off this is what I was born with and this is what I'm keeping so mind your business people say oh well because you know you're married or because you're this or because you're that part of me it's a pride thing because I feel like I have been lindsie Chrisley like my whole life and I am Lindsay Campbell Mary Ellen T Chrisley Campbell butt if I have successes I don't know like what it is but it's it's like lindsie Chrisley is me and I am her right successes should be associated with that and like my failures should be associated with that and I definitely got what you're saying I mean I I went through a period where I wanted to change my last name but at that point I had already been on the show and I was like I'm already kail Lowry like people already know me ask Hillary this is who I've been my whole life so I guess it doesn't really make sense for me to turn around and change my last name like this is who I am this is my brand this is me outside of my family troubles and my family bullshit you know what I mean so I get it I get what you're saying so those are just like a few things that I just wanted to clarify and obviously I'll be able to talk more at a later date but right now with the way that things are and if you're reading you'll realize why I can't go into details about certain things I just want to encourage you to go over to my Twitter read the facts and then I don't have anybody's opinion like either so like if you know Pro whatever your desert you're in different feel however you want to see all that's perfectly fine but just read the facts watch how people operate and I think that you'll be able to see a very clear picture once you do that and I agree a lot of people had you know I do I did that question thing like before we record it cuz we were supposed to record and then I got sick and I forget something else came up but who the hell gets like the flu in August like I don't know I don't know how he is her whatever yeah it's literally been 2 months from hell but the second most commonly asked question from my you know family vs was about the Hobby and More in drama and I don't know like what you can share his obviously like I've had to be a little tight-lipped about certain things to so whatever you can share that's what people want to know the tea is hot on this episode of coffee convos because I completely forgot about that bullshit until you just brought it up the amount of shit we've talked on this whole podcast today has been unreal I know pretty much the entire situation from start to finish because I was called to the scene of the crime and then I was later blamed as the problem so I can get into all of the details however I will say that that was not a mess that I was planning to clean up it wasn't mine called me but somehow I got involved in it and you know oh I just there's so many things I can say and there's a lot of directions I can go here I think nope I don't even know where to go with this I saw the apology that hobby wrote on Instagram and I had actually encouraged him prior to that to make a statement because somebody leaked the story it was not me I didn't do it and I actually was very upset that I was blamed for it because the night that everything happened I was called eight times in the middle of the night so I'm thinking somebody died and that was really upsetting I couldn't sleep I didn't know what to do and then I was later blamed for it but it's like you you can't do that till I call a x right but then also it's like there's a fine line like they're can we also can't be doing that like I ain't like a cop called me also so it was like a cop and then hobby to but it was like we can't blur those lines like those lines cannot be blurred your we are both doing our own thing and I don't want to upset anyone you're in a relationship with I don't want to upset anyone I'm in a relationship with still like that was like if no one died like you can't do that but I understand there was like liquor involved in like other things but I was very upset because I was blamed for the leak and then you know I just I didn't want any part of it but I feel like everyone was tagging me in Hobbies apology and you know I don't really I don't have much to say about it I feel like we all make decisions whether they're good or bad and we all have to either reap the benefits or we have to deal with the consequences and I feel like hopefully this was a learning curve for everybody I hope this was a mistake that he made that he will learn from moving forward but I don't want to say too many details cuz it's not my place anymore but I do hope that my son Lincoln and I do even though I don't really know Eli I hope that they are still getting both of are you going to want to see both of their parents cuz I'm Lincoln's only mom but I hope that the kids are taken care of and nothing is truly affecting them other than you know they're trying to cope. We're getting back together I don't know so long story short I have nothing to say I'm I never want to be involved in a mess like that again and that's all stated that what people are tagging me in it and it was like what are you tagging me for poison I was getting messages about it as if I don't have enough going on I thought I was just going to like try to go down the freeway as fast as I could and fling my phone out yeah like I I really thought that cuz I was like nothing else can happen like nothing else can freaking happen because there's so much shit going on and I swear like it is so true the saying when it rains it pours a day it was literally between you and your family stuff going on the hobby drama I was bombarded with I guess and then all this shit last week I was like a literally I don't think that I've seen a worse two and a half weeks like I truly haven't I think it's going to go down in history of my life it's really crazy though because I will say that there have been other less crazy things that have happened that have really put me in a dark place but for whatever reason and I don't know what it is these last two and a half weeks I have not been consumed by them I guess like I chi I do see the light at the end of the tunnel like I do see it and I know that things are going to get better and that's very like different for me and I hope it's the same for you like I hope that you're seeing like things are going to get better I think a lot of people to have message me because I haven't liked posted anything on Instagram you know and right keyboard like wondering like where I was going like obviously intentional that I'm not posting like I'm trying to really like take care of me and take care of like my house and what's going on like inside my four walls I can happily say that we're all on the same page and that's a good place to be I feel like. I'm sad that the situation is what the situation is because no matter what its family you know and so that's unfortunate but I have had to learn that if something is toxic you have to remove it out of your life as hard as that may be and it's not a revolving door and it's not an open invitation a lot of people that have toxic family relationships have sent in messages you know saying you know this is giving me strength or this is open my eyes are you know whatever it may be and I hope that somebody even if it's one person that gets some type of benefit from the struggle that I'm currently going through then it was 100% worth it but one thing that I will stand by is don't ever go out here and lie on me and I will not feel obligated to tell the truth about you that is the true statement yeah I just think like because obviously I don't talk to my family either a message that I get all the time is like oh you should give them another chance so that's your mom oh that's your dad oh that's your sewing so and it's like toxic is toxic is toxic so it doesn't matter who it is in your life if they are toxic you remove them so just to add to what you were saying I mean yeah I mean and don't lie on somebody who who has the truth about you because honestly at the end of the day like that's going to come out all the open the truth always comes out the truth always comes out even when I try to stand by that even if it's on accident and it comes out another way that doesn't involve you it will come out what is done in the dark always comes to light so I just didn't think that legal issues and then things that happened through my separation went hand-in-hand and maybe I'm wrong you know like I just I felt like those were two totally different things on two totally opposite ends of the spectrum that should have never merged but that's my opinion and people are free to you know how other paintings about it but wow like I can't believe it's already been an hour I know that's what we had so much talked about and I'm sure we'll have so much more next week I know people are going to be so upset that this isn't earlier I know people wanted it this week so I'm sorry that we were sick and all life was happening at once but I'm glad that y'all can be a part of it and some of you might not be happy to be a part of it but I feel very stressed being a part of it is stress is residing and I feel like I'm starting to feel a little bit better so I didn't have time for this week so if you guys have not subscribed to us you can do that by searching a purple podcast app on your iPhone typing coffee, those click subscribe click V Star and leave us are written review we are also available now on Pandora as well we hope you guys have a great and will talk to you soon see you podcast Networks
