may have crossed that threshold last night with bachelor in paradise just all of it I thought that one was better though no okay you know oh man first off JPJ oh yeah John Paul Jones he fucking dm's me somebody asked me to do my best impression of him okay and this fool is just [Music] so what's up guys literally it that's funny I'm assuming nobody was laughing to begin with he just comes into a conversation like that yeah like yeah you good man yeah no I mean so is he on the show right now yeah so then how the fuck did EDM me I mean I think it's done okay so they they shoot it yeah it's not like well violin where it's like live no okay no I think it's been done okay yeah that's basically how that dude talks yeah you got it oh man I believe it was him he said the dumbest shit possible what'd he say he's like talking this black girl and he was like you're like Beyonce but you just have like bigger eyes and I'm like is Beyonce the only black chick you've seen yeah enough higher life it's definitely what it is dumb fucking idiot yeah the girl he was talking to look nothing like Beyonce - her skin what are you fucking idiot fucking right me Jesus Christ I could not believe that like my jaw hit the floor I'm like he's actually a moron like to the hi what that's kind of funny that's like what would that the other way around be what like like just to some white girl oh yeah you look like Taylor Swift your students yeah what is like some random at what what I just went for a pop star I'm about to get fucking crucified for compared Beyonce to Taylor Swift although apparently her new albums fuck dude this is crazy man Taylor Swift's new album yeah was are like a day after it released was already the biggest album release of the year is get outta here like for the week it was like they sold two million copies overnight or something how fucking crazy is that her fan base is another level dude it's all it's all cuz the tik-tok what do you mean no just ease a tick-tock of what I mean like I would be surprised if that was the case you think her songs are on tik-tok no I think I think it's like now I think it's legitimately her man's yeah I don't think anyone on take talk is I don't think Gen Z is a fan of Taylor Swift no I feel like it's like Millennials t-swift actually now that's not true we won't went to her show it was like Hello little kids yeah 10 like the things of old people do she uh whatever fucks he swiftly and every time I her I don't even like that I gave her a nickname yes I like that even typed it away keep going yeah so bachelor paradise man first off you know that shit's changing when ABC conservative asks reality TV starts like trying to virtue signal it's crazy they uh so this this dude Dean he came on a few seasons ago and he was like this clean-cut dapper dude Dean Dean yay he came into the show like all dapper and clean-cut Oh Debbie deemed epidemia yeah Deepa Dean Dean even know it I can't even what the fuck was that I was gonna like say something really found and I just I I II mighty stupid a I said I call my penis Fridays ami what are you doing oh yeah mate is that big a damper Dean's pulling up my ah drop the trap I'm gonna fuck your key and we're fuckin gone I'm gonna fuck you cunt you can't scream at [Laughter] you oh fuck you cunt EMI Tuesday Pettine how to do it to step into you wallaby yeah yeah yeah about a fried shrimp on your Bobby doing a little dance waving your dick in the air what oh yeah get off my shrimp yeah what a fucking cunt what a little Joey in ya Am I oh you should so fuckin stupid ass show calm it's full Dean he like he came to the show all clean and he was like afraid to introduce the girl Rachel to his dad because he was like he's like a Hari Krishna or something and like he used to be David but now he's like you know he's got like like a Swami name like it's like a Indian surname and and he he he's just like off the rails in terms of like spirituality he like lives and like butt fuck nowhere and and so he was like clown and his dad for being like this like weird spiritual free spirit dude this season this fools got his hair grown out he's living out of a van this is Dean yeah I got a fucking yeah he got a serial killer mustache from the 80s and he just like he's the coldest most savage like he's like he's chatting up this girl the whole season he's got her she's some fucking you know plain-jane ass chick sort of like so by-the-book and and like he just dropped a bomb on her like in the middle of the show he's like I don't think he's like this is yeah this obviously isn't gonna work after this cuz like I live in a van and like I don't want to spend my life like going to dinner parties and talking about her feelings like hey that's boring he's like he's like a van life dude yeah yeah Instagram did yeah your life van life but honestly so stupid i but like I honestly think that it's it's some type of weird I don't know I have like this jaded look at all the bachelor people like everything they do is some ww-what the hell go ahead say it good it must have found my mixtape yeah there you go Thanks appreciate just like old though ya know I feel like everything they do is like some WWF like scripted like alright you're gonna turn into this dude because then we're gonna bring you back for this season and it wasn't like I feel like the producers are involved in all that bullshit mmm cuz like you look at like his van life pictures and it's not a typical van life dude like they're all like professional shots of him shirtless that's this is what I'm talking about this van life shit is so fucking stupid because it's like it's like they really are way more vain than anyone else like other wait they're way more concerned with like appearances then then people that just live in cities yeah you know I'm saying a little bit if you ever see one of these fucking van life is good search hashtag van life yeah it's like they're all like that it's all like perfect like at least one person in the van is a photographer it's usually a couple mm-hmm and oh you're talking about that kind of Van Lines yeah they can hole where they like convert a little van to whatever and then they just they just make people envious of that life yeah they're soul goals like drive around to beautiful places and all their pictures take a picture the sunset of the guy and a dog laying on the bed and it's like hashtag van lights like don't you don't you see how contradicting this is yeah and then they they all finger wag you about how living in your big house and all that urban City is it's not necessary you should be more in touch with nature that should be more in touch with nature all your take pictures of your girl it's at a fucking yeah exactly at a van rest stop people fucking taking the subway every day yeah yeah you know saying like people that live in cities they probably use less waste and they're fucking no distributing yeah yeah no no so okay I think there's a split what the fuck is that now AC no so I was somebody just fired up their props drill or some shit yeah that's that's Ronnie J he's downstairs he's cooking up in you know 808 there okay so I have to say real quick van life people follow two categories for me there's that van life where it's just hot people being assholes mm-hmm and then there's the other van life where it's like rock climbers that have like two posts oh yeah truly about yeah yeah because they don't give a fuck about it yeah yeah yeah that's why you don't see that shit yeah it's just like a pot the first picture the second picture is like Mountain that's like sick and that's it about that about to climb this yeah van life and that's it and that's it and then you're like did they fall off the bed or another boat four years later you'll send an update of like his shoe yeah need some new ones yeah yeah that's that's like my friend he bought a he bought this giant Sprinter and converted it over like the course of like six seven months it was like it's bone personal project spend a bunch of money converting this van into this like beautiful fucking house that he could drive anywhere yeah and he just fucking drives around surfs climbs mountains yeah he does crazy ass shit yeah so every once in a while he'll throw some shit up on a story and it's like damn but he's not like no no he's not like the overly visco filtered images and no he just really lives that life it's crazy so yeah his whole van life shit is some bullshit and so like I thought it was funny that like they're trying to just like I don't know like it to me felt like them trying to break the like conservative stereotype of all the people on that show like oh I the contestants aren't all fucking boring religious people uh look at Dean he lives in a van and there's a gypsy he's a gypsy which is something you can't say but gypsy yeah you can't say gypsy yeah that's that's a bad one Nick you can say it no no you can you really can't that's a slur yeah it is no way it's a slur yeah yeah the my Lina's cousins tell me about this okay what she was sent or he was telling me that the proper term is it's something like the traveling community that's what it is it's traveling community I'm googling this right now go ahead I know you didn't mean it that way you definitely didn't mean it that way this is like obscure like UK knowledge that I have gipsy while normally considered a racial slur yes there you go the word gipsy in the u.s. refers to a person of a Romani heritage so there you go I'm safe sort of I'm gonna give you the passage that you meant that in the in the hunchback of notre just means like a traveling yeah yeah yeah yeah just like a nomad yeah anyway yeah look at look at Dean look at Dean yeah oh yeah he's a pain yeah he's a free kind of spirit look at him in his six-pack in his van he lives in a van yeah travelling freely all around the states with a photographer yeah fucking the shit out of everybody so that's me reading chlamydia that to me was like fuck out of here she's all crying and I was like dying laughing at this she's like oh yeah the guy in the van wouldn't want to be in a long-term relationship I just don't get it mmm whatever the thing that was really goofy was there's a girl on the show who I guess is by and in the middle of a show apparently she says I'm this is I could not believe that she goes I'm not sure if I like the guy that I'm dating on the show because I'm dating a girl outside the show and then they bring this random girl who's not even part of the show to the show so that they have this goofy row ceremony where they have her go first and she gives a rose to this random girl that they brought on the show so now I guess she's part of the show it's like this so that's some love Island shit they're taking a page out of Lowe Allen's book maybe but it just felt bad I'd like it like it was so shoehorn and I'm like dude nobody gay or anything like anyone for I feel like watches the show like on ironically yeah I'm saying yeah I feel like people who truly enjoy bachelor in paradise like are like moms mm-hmm and everyone else thinks it's just so fucking stupid yeah so to me I'm like who are you virtue signaling for yeah like just just keep it you're goofy crazy blonde chicks and stupid guys mm-hmm I didn't I mean whatever maybe it's a good thing that they're trying to switch it up I don't know but yeah it felt like I felt like some goofy ass fake shit hmm like that also is pretty um it also is pretty like WBE that's what I mean is bringing in a random care yeah has never yeah I mean it's Tiana she's gonna eat pussy and suck dick I'm here to eat pussy and subducting see oh I don't care I don't care what you think about that cut to David oh I'm really scared that Tiana's gonna take my girl because she sucks dick and eats pussy she sucks pussy and eats dick dude I wish she just came in fucking you'll never know what I'll do I'll suck a dick and eat some pussy in the same day I'm crazy every fucking suburban mom is like oh yo my goodness Britney did you see last night did you see last night I could not believe what that woman was saying that woman eats vagina horrible in the same day I always I always I always say that shit is WWF but like it really it really just sent me over the top but here's the thing that pushed me to like fuck show hmm fuck this show they took two people from previous season two goofballs and they're getting married on this season's televised marriage or whatever then they put people as bridesmaids and groomsmen and shit to purposefully milk drama yeah and like stir up old shit and get these stupid-ass people being like oh maybe you're like the grew into witty uh-huh and I'm just like maybe I like the groom's wedding I don't know I don't know I thought I liked the girl in front of you no no way like it's like people who's like come on dude how are you this stupid how like all they have to do is see their ex and they're falling in love again that's great yeah and so then they have like oh it's like people crying at the wedding and I'm like give these shitty people making this wedding about themselves yeah just got am so damn so what are you retired now I might be man yeah it legitimately pissed me off Wow just getting super fucking hey I know what grown man pacing around your living room at the bachelor in paradise was a bunch of bullshit yeah I can't wait to talk about this tomorrow for a half an hour yeah yeah I did exactly what they wanted me to do and I did exactly what every guy in their late teenage years does yeah gets really mad about the bachelor talks about on his podcast exactly yeah what about this dude what about Dan life that dudes named Dan oh just hashtag and Dan life on everything yeah it's just living yeah you know yeah is Dan life its Dan life your name is Dan I want to see throw that hashtag up on Instagram I'm gonna be searching it all right just do shit normal shit go to your job eat your sandwich but take a picture of sandwich and hashtag it Dan life another cold one out of the water cooler here hashtag Dan life sip in a cold brew hashtag Dan life once with mom hashtag Dan life and I'm saying about that Dan life yeah she's the one who made this Dan life Oh that has to be I we really need a parity The Bachelor but it has to be that way yeah like in the middle of a really romantic moment that's just all you hear yeah and then crazy bisexual just gonna punch in through the wall yeah that's a great idea it's just a dude I do you previously thought was straight uh-huh I actually have to tell you something I'm bi as well and they start making out yeah she's another girl she's like I have to tell you something too and then just everyone on the show bye that's their trope everyone on the show it's called bachelor in paradise yeah bye bye slurs in paradise and then there's John Paul Jones on the side why did he do why did he dam me let's see what he said let's see what JPJ said to me I don't know who he was and then I was like I look this thing I'm like damn fucking oh man dude this is gonna be the meanest way for him to find out what that may be watch that whole fucking John Paul by the way some of y'all are asking if we're ever gonna move out of this storage closet or repaint it and the answer is yes and I believe all the changes will take place just in time for episode 100 he said dude I love your videos man let me know if you want to collab sometime and then it looked like it was like we want his page I was like fuck is this dude it's like a thousand comments on every picture and I told Kelsey and she was like oh my god that guy's from The Bachelor he's got some fucking flow though dude you got some hair on your brother yeah yeah yeah keep that up dude yeah that's great that's great and I don't about it I don't know what we'd collab that was the only thing what kind of videos are we thinking I don't know oh maybe we can have them on we're gonna have like um we're gonna have like a little bench yeah guess yeah so maybe we'll start dabbling with bringing bringing some guests on just just some quick SEC ease into it you know it's a quick quick 15 20 minute segments that's what I'm thinking yeah I'm Hobson for a bit I be not it'd be kind of funny we cool yeah they have them on yeah a little bachelor in paradise yeah I definitely own up to everything I just said though what do you mean like I do the impression from him yeah I mean he probably knows you think I mean like Kelsey was like oh my God he's like the goofiest dude ever that's the other thing is I don't know you can never tell what The Bachelor editing how how can did any of those moments are yeah exactly like he could adjust to find out maybe they just took all the moments where he's laughing and the editors like I'm gonna make this guy look like such a moron cuts them together yeah so just laughing for like 30 seconds they're thinking what the fuck I just chuckled for like a second I wasn't laughing that long I don't even sound like that yeah there's also are we gonna get are we gonna get one of those things where it's like a fucking camera angle switcher or whatever so we'll have like a camera on the guest bench and then maybe like a wide shot and then like one on each of us first of all I love that technical term camera angle switcher switch image in me what the fuck is wrong room scene switcher I mean no I mean we could do that I think I feel like that'd make the video look like shit but that's a what do you mean I'm trying to think how that could work I was watching I was watching the morning toast on YouTube yeah we couldn't do that and we could use like a OBS yeah we could do some OBS no wouldn't be with OBS it's a hardware thing no I know but I was understanding of a simple way to capture the video feed like you could do that with OBS can't you do it through one of those like ninja screens or whatever because you could do multiple video and or no you could do one it video input to that mm-hm and then you have like a little button like it's like a hardware thing just switches the input right I'm so you we'd have someone sitting there switching so that when the guest talked you'd press the button and it would go into the ninja I would have to look at that I've not seen any hardware I've never looked at that so it's totally possible that exists I've never seen that though okay so no it's totally yeah I mean that's that's basically the stream decades I was thinking of that yeah exactly yeah yeah but instead I'm sort of shit yes was that software no stream Decker's hardware it is they have a hardware device that you can just that's what I use in my stream oh yeah it's the actual buttons right yeah but is that what is that no but that all that does is program that's like a MIDI thing like it like just know sends a software signal out know like it switches the scene no I know but I'm saying like it's it's the thing that I'm talking about when this is on the bug that's the thing that I'm talking like all that does is send an electronic signal to your computer that tells the program to switch the scene yeah right but this is actual hardware yeah it like actually like you plug two things into it oh and all it does just wouldn't put yeah chooses the input fine yeah in same shit I think that would work either way I'm pretty sure that exists if you know what we're talking about if you're working production yeah just link that in the comments yeah cuz we're gonna need something like that now we're all uh yeah I was like I was looking a while back you're like cutting like multiple camera angles and um in Premiere and there's like no automated way to do it yeah I mean that's why I has to be like the actual feet yeah yeah no it has to be like baked in whether it's like like hardware or if we do like OBS or something like did something there for sure yeah well do you see some broadcast bullshit any of it yeah that's what I was thinking yeah so it seems I guess the best way would be to shoot all three and then have someone caught it together afterwards yeah that's what take for fucking ever yeah I don't I don't like that yeah I'm big I like the idea of a hardware switch yeah just the same just have someone just clicking yeah yeah I'm sure you guys have found that part of the pocket is really riveting yeah yeah exactly Cody and I saying the same thing as a programmer conversation right there yeah no do it on the hardware level that's the title of this episode yeah no I mean I'm I'm more in the Dan life camp but yeah yeah that's fine that's Dan life you know it is brother just you know switching scenes over here on the podcast dude named Dan yeah speaking of hiring a dude knock on wood and I don't want to jinx it but we um we're in the final stages man yeah let's hope yeah hoping this happens a knock on l btec shield and knock on the l btec shield I'm saying knock knock baby yeah mmm yawns are gonna get things are gonna get done around here and get done uh which is gonna be nice it's nice to be home in oh yeah oh yeah it is loving it yeah nice to be home nice to be home except the fucking only day off that I had mm-hmm I was somebody I had to get my visa renewed right it happened like a couple

was expiring the next day so yesterday oh and I'm like fuck I got a drive to set all month like I don't have a day off all month cousin you know well I don't think so maybe maybe I do mm-hmm so I texted a mirror and I was like dude my license expires tomorrow and he was like oh fuck he was like you have to get a new one I didn't realize how big of a deal it is driving on an expired license yeah getting any sort of accidents insurance doesn't cover anything if you're driving on an expired license it's just straight-up doesn't so whatever so he's freaking out and he's like you got to go

fucking gaming I had some I had something hold on now so what's been going on but what has been going on how's the week been I gained what else did I do did have one show at work we did some scratch records for purposes that will not be discussed yet that was fun though it was it some good music um I keep listening to that song yeah yeah I like it it's fun yeah it's a it's a fun track huh he knows funny I was listening to her I saw like on Jack Harlow's Instagram story or something like that he does it every Wednesday really get answers people's questions uh-huh you know and one of those like yes yeah things whatever and someone asked him about somebody did something to do with demos or something like that and he says he doesn't listen to his own demos like he'll go in the studio he'll like record something and then he'll just like leave it and like not listen to it until he goes in the studio again yeah yeah and I'm like I was thinking about that I was like this might be this is a complete opposite of what I do yeah we record something and then I'll listen to it that's all I'll listen to for like three days until I'm fucking completely sick of it yeah which is stupid probably yeah cuz then I start overthinking everything and I'm like this is so dumb I've been trying to do that more or I don't listen something really yeah I mean really trying to do that more yeah I don't like try let's do it a few times okay let's see if I got ideas for and I just leave it alone fair enough I'm dude not that I'm on reddit first up what's been going on on the know first of the that picture that I sent the other day of the winners of the Invitational well when we pull that up again yes so this team it's the first time the first team to win this tournament twice this is like that big dota tournament okay oh yeah that like flyer you sent yeah deal with that they won fifteen million dollars what yeah that's what it says in the Bible five split five ways holy fuck that's what three million each roughly that's crazy 15 mil bro shit yeah that's why they're making all these goofy ass faces yeah is that here let's see this fucking Harry Potter I know it looks like a Quidditch team no it looks like I was gonna say it looks like a Madame Tussaud magician Act five five man magician act and Madame Tussaud yeah seriously so they won two years in a row not in a row but I think they want to these motherfuckers are rich yeah yeah that's why they're doing as good as faces yeah oh yeah talk shit about gaming one more time talk shit about dota I can't hear you my Ferraris too loud yeah exactly yeah yeah it's so funny fucking that's crazy man mm-hmm that tournament is crazy here so what is it was it like in a stadium yeah it's huge okay I'm it dude that like the I've said that I'm sorry was the last episode but like the the booths they build for the teams it's like they're all glass soundproofed like it like fits like staff no it's like you got your five players and their fucking whoever captain like standing behind them like calling strat and just whatever calling strat oh yeah mm-hmm actually I don't know that they have a I think because in counter-strike you can have like a strike hauler I believe you have a sixth man like on the mic who can who can speak really I think so yeah and he just tell him he's like a coach bro yeah dude counter-strike strat is crazy I was like that you abbreviate that every time strat strategy yeah no strat I've never heard anyone shorten that before gaming bruh it's calling strat we've gone strat yeah yeah who guys who got this try revision but this is the first you can't say that every round what is the strategy brother you can't know what's the strat it was that kind of just point it was right it's right you can just say like that yeah strat nice work strat question one stretch stretch we were joking yesterday that like cuz we were drinking in all the scenes uh-huh and it was all like fake like just water or like food coloring in water yeah we're just joking about if it was real there's nobody see fucked up for this and by the end we're just like like just just saying sounds I fired we go to my lines with Johnny stop we're joking yeah Chet Chester it's so fucked up or just do it all bad yeah like the emotion doesn't match yeah I think real serious you gonna be like Johnny Johnny stop yeah just walk in do every line really bad yeah like the troll movie or whatever yeah yeah bro strap strap I turn the whole reason I played is gonna tune into the starladder tournament which I'd never heard of their tour thousand people watching Jesus yeah walk and then and then old World of Warcraft is back so they call it Wow classic everyone's playing that shit yeah what the fuck is that I've seen some shit about that it's like we're back in 2005 this is so lame dude it is so fucking lame doctor disrespect was clowning he's like I'm not playing that Wow classic bull he's like hitting little dragons gaining XP hidden cute little animals and stuff now we're here to play real games there's something goin to like to be honest he kind of made wild classic sound kind of cool do you think it was like it wasn't like propaganda back in the days where WoW was huge that it was just like destroying people's lives remember like no that was shitty all of the shit in the news about Wow cuz I never played it but like everything I ever heard about that game was that it sucks you in and it fucks up your life I mean me and and it and people like would go to rehab for wow like it was like something is like an addiction no that's how I understood it I mean I think that was partially Fox News just trying to say video games or you know the reason for dark shit but also like wow definitely fuck people's life yeah like it was also people that I that I met who played it that were like I think that were like thank God I got out now like thank fucking god I got out cuz dude it was like it was the first of its kind like a true MMORPG like you only heard of that I felt like like that sort of there were other games that were arguably better that did the MMO concept well but I think wow was just the most like mainstream and it's cut it was like the fortnight of that time mm-hmm it was just like a game yeah but people did like four and I didn't ruin people's a lot no but that's because like there's ten years of gaming now like online and and and sort of like in that like to that degree yeah Wow I felt like was the first game where everyone fucking plated everyone and it was like at any point in time you could be like you you want to go raid right now yeah dude yeah let's go do it fuck everything let's go raid I'm 25 who gives a shit the Internet's way cooler than real life a job who gives a fuck yeah I'll just live at home I want to play this shit yeah all day yeah you know people got out of it and now they realize that oh shit that was those fuck though but yeah that would that was true I knew so many people that fuck their life up because well mmm my fucking buddies they were they so I had just quit playing counter-strike and my buddies kept playing and there's this league that they played in and they went on to be like a top team like like one of the you know arguably one of the best teams at that time you know and they started playing Wow and like it just destroyed them like the team just fell apart they don't want to play counter-strike anymore they just like pissed that all away that's what I mean it's not fucking weird it's crazy yeah it's crazy well I just think some the game is cursed cursed do you think so yeah think about it man think about it just serious I don't you don't be honest no I don't think it's a good thing it's just I've now I have no knowledge yet anything I think all that game is terrible cursed yeah I think it's cursed it does bad things to you it's the only game where I've like you know other games like there's there's a positive connotation whenever people talk about them it's like yeah call duty yeah I was addicted to it but like it was like some of the most fun I've ever had in my entire life I think that's why you've never had now you've never heard that we Wow people are just like yeah I've just I just it's like repetition I just loved yeah just fuckin rating and yeah you know it's like routine yeah it's like this thing you get sucked into or that's what you have to do it and just like no one ever was like oh my god I remember so fondly my WoW days it's always like oh yeah I was I was into that game for a while yeah thank God I fucking quit yeah no yeah that's true everyone that plays plays Wow is like and then when Wow classic came out you hear the way everyone's talking about like whoo time to fuck my life up again yeah yeah that's what I mean it's it's basically the heroine of games yeah that's one thing is that good shit yeah and then the new shit doesn't hit the same black tar yeah definitely yeah of video games where it's like called duties more like cocaine yeah I could never get into wow I played it for like a month and I was like this is so fucking boring and people were like trying to tell me how to yeah he's just gonna go to this part of the map and you're just gonna like kill the little animals and you're gonna farm and then you're gonna get XP and then I'm like for what they're like you get a drag and you get a cool armor and you get like I'm like I gotta play six months just to play with other people because I'm too low level I'll play is goofy ass fucking shit I gotta wait six months to have fun yes plane up like that yeah went right back to quake yeah yeah I don't know everyone's playing it right now though that's crazy wait and they're streaming it to oh yeah tap man everybody really yeah so four night he's like dead well the that so they they reverted that thing they did the other day okay yeah welcome to the gaming hour yeah welcome to the gaming hour I'm a Gaiman I'm a gay man I'm a gaming calm I'm a gaming yeah they um what are you doing I'm a gaming I'm a gaming I'm a game in I'm in the gamin you deserve I love gaming what what I love gaming okay I thought you were saying something yeah I'm in today's games I'm in the game I'm voguing gaming I'm a fucking gaming yeah for tonight almost died like overnight they made that change the turbo building and literally everyone was I am not playing this and then it seems like they're trying to kill it no I think they got I think they finally like got shook that vastest they've ever changed something I feel like that was like within 24 hours like I'll fuck and they they put it back like it it makes me wonder this is fucking just boring as shit but it makes me wonder like if if they just if there if they changed it as a reactionary thing or if they were really trying to improve the game like if it would have just fucking left it like it was what it'd still be semi popular oh yeah they were they changing it because they saw like a downward graph and they're trying to create like drama or whatever or just trying to create like some some mechanic that made it grow again or they were they changing it because it was like a pre-emptive thing it's like what we don't want to see this growth decline so we're just gonna change it for the sake of like God changes him that's not broken you know I mean yeah the I mean it seems like they just fucked it up yeah they kind of I don't know I mean that I I'm into the theory that they're trying to kill the game because they got a new game they want to put out yeah but that's weird like if you have something that's just pumping money mm-hmm like just it's a cash machine why the fuck would you purposely kill that for another game that you don't even know is gonna work it's a good question I mean I don't know I that's the part of the gaming industry I don't understand but it seems to be that like maybe that's the cycle for for games like fortnight well it was like DLC and all that shit like it's like it had the initial hype it leveled out now it's like in just a steady like you know just drop off IDC to drop off coming so maybe in their mine like I don't I don't think it's like some TMZ shit where they think like oh we're gonna make this change and piss everyone off and like undo it I don't I don't think it's that I legitimately think that it's either a they are slowly making changes with the idea that well yeah we want to sort of you know we understand the pro players are a little frustrated we want to wean them off the game it's given us ideas about a new game we want to put out and so we kind of want to kill the competitive nature of fortnight in order to put out this new game and and you know whatever and I think there's maybe a lot of like thinking that goes into that because you know obviously pro gamers and streamers and stuff I think they kind of dictate the pace of like popularity and like what kids play and shit you know like little kids but I want to I want to play the tap man's playing or whatever yeah and so yeah we saw a kid in Regina that had a ninja's hair that was crazy that was the craziest fucking shit yeah it was like a probably like a 12 year old kid had it half of his head dyed purple and the other half blue yeah just because that's exactly how ninja had it at that point it's crazy I wanted so bad to comment on his Instagram post where he was like new hair ninja yeah cuz it's all purple now right I just wanted to comment shits clean bro yeah yeah I don't know I should have done it it's just cleaning yeah it's just fine shit's clean just fine my guy bright purple shit bangs shit's clean bro yeah ninjas should get bangs dude Jeff wants free one day cold a set of bangs yo was poppin the complete opposite of his hairstyle yeah he should have gone to mix her and put his fucking yeah hangs that and dyed his hair black yeah yeah also probably got around to washing his like announcement video this weird sketch so bad yeah so the press release shit what a horrible way to handle that I know is that terrible I don't know that it's just like just trying to get him to do comedy yeah report him in like a comedic situation like that it's like it doesn't have to be that I feel just doesn't work no I feel like maybe he like I feel like a better thing what had just been him being like um I uh yeah I'm switching yeah and that's it yeah I don't know it's like the whole lid I wonder if people are watching him on mixer they're uh they probably are I think he has a core fan base I really do fuckin bruh you got a like a collab with adidas not a collab dude it's a whole line maybe not a line but like um yeah you got sponsorship yeah dude I think crazy how much fuckin money he's still making I think by being like it sorry I think that speaks to the power of like like what him being like right place right time was cuz eSports is like and just gaming in general is fuckin huge that's why everyone's buying into it fucking quavo invested in phase I know I know was it quavo or was it an offset someone from the mingoes invest in a phase yeah and Drake's bought into a hundred thieves and why do we we got to do something what are we gonna do a game let's get in yeah let's get into it I was talking about this yesterday there's gotta be something we could do to get in there like a product uh uh that's what I'm thinking yeah I know we've talked about it a little flavored powder or something would you do that into your drink and that's already been done G fuel joke I know you're joking but I'm seriously gaming club rainstorm mode right now I know we've talked about don't pole hadn't did dump poles yeah we've talked about a little bit about G catheters the inner catheter cath right yeah what is there something what about this okay just throwing just kind of spitballing right now okay um some sort of you know pizza pop or something like that yeah well it like g g pop maybe that like that we make a line of popsicles it's like it's like nasa space food okay okay cuz gamers it's always on the go you need a meal on the go you got to be

like the Asian package so it's like orange chicken and fried rice flavor like that okay he's burger flavor yeah go yeah I like that go go orange chicken gorn's chicken [Laughter] [Music] bucket dude stream just being like oh I gotta eat real quick he pulls out a silver package fucking Panda Express on he just he puts on the table and just slams it with his fist and it just it just punches it in

for a game Rose always on the go this day go gamers I like that you I like the concept of gamers always been on the go but like this is the same fuckin place ten hours a day that's why if you're a gamer you know you're always on the go that's what killed it but ninja like having active where he's just walking and sits down in this computer and this fucking fleece tracksuit friend Edith and a sponsored fucking headband just that literally the most uncomfortable shit the most uncomfortable shit oh my god here's our product dude there's got to make like gamer pants like gamer underwear mmm you know we've already talked about that know something that's like really comfortable it's like really soft and mesh mm-hmm and it's got like a you know like the boxer pisshole it's got a giant one okay so it's really you get your whole fist in there okay we're all transit and get your whole hand in just keep it warm mm-hmm Oh row one out okay when you go pee like it's just like an easy that is a big ol flap what about what about this what about like a temperature-controlled mouse or keyboard or chair or something you know I mean that's so expensive and so difficult with so much engineering no temperature-controlled like what like secret labs and they already make the Audi chairs they really made the Audi of gamer chairs so what are we gonna make no I know I know but someone yesterday was talking about like how the fucking guys if you go on Kickstarter you can find a lot of like like gaming products and they all fucking work cuz like the shit is so big right now yeah that like kids will buy if you generate a little bit of hype like if you if you basically be like although the the mouse is like a little bit lighter than other ones but the keyboard does this better or or something right it's just fucking pops because it's such a big market right now um okay look what could our our gamer uh here we go this goes real simple meat mouse pads mouse pads made out of meat yeah you could just take a chunk off while you're playing big old beef loaf huge yeah yeah like that tear off a little chunk what about a mousepad that that does like tracking for I don't know data of some sort tracks your movement it's creepy and then no tracks your movements and then optimizes that area on the mouse pad for I don't know but you know I'm saying I'm trying to brainstorming yeah we're just building something that would take ten years again yeah what about a mousepad that could read all your moving your mouse for yeah yeah yeah yeah if you okay you're being serious you really want to get into the eSports market yeah are like okay here what about this okay what about this got something okay you know that you know when you're at like a pool party in Vegas or whatever DJ hits a sick fucking song yeah she got like the fog things that blow up that crazy shit what if you hit a fucking super sick dub and you had things attached to your monitor that ya spray make your dream fucking lit yeah right in the face it will you down a little bit yeah it would make you look cool like a DJ oh no that's what we need do we got to build cheap um stage production for streamers yeah yeah it kind of makes it yeah pyro all of it hmm like make ninjas game room accessible to the masses yeah so that you can just have like a plug-and-play thing where as soon as you hit a fucking dub strobe lights are going off whole pyro yeah cool music yeah there it is I don't know man so I think for a gaming product it's not a mouse it's not a keyboard I think it could be consumable I think that's a realistic one but even then I don't know gamer draft stuff that takes like years to do and that kind of cycles in and out there you're getting like fucking approved by the FDA and shit like that are that popping ass drink balls no be awls now that sounds awesome that was a gamer drink that gives you some cojones the fucking the bottle was ribbed it like had like little nubs on it it was crazy look it up right now be awls so you can put it in your ass afterwards you could have definitely put that thing in your ass b8w you can put balls in your ass yeah BAW LZ oh my god this shit is sick it's blue right it's the blue bottle I love the ribbed just for optimal gripping capacity so that should had guarna in it or whatever highly caffeinated yet degree Miam soda that's it had you going it was fucked up yeah this is awesome this is fucking awesome these ingredients fucking rule dude carbonated water high fructose corn syrup citric acid natural guarana extract sodium benzoate it's just fucking caffeine sugar and salt as well why not yeah that should fucked you up as a kid did the first question are the bottle studded so I can get a better grip on my balls yes yep yeah that's that so a consumable game or drink that's that's tough that's gonna be hard realistically as far as getting in with a game I mean the thing with gaming now is it's super what niche do you want to get into yeah it's still it's still in its early days though that's a thing I don't know I don't know what you could do well think of something if you got the ideas head hit the damn hit the email at the email it was LeAnn it's that hot link yeah let's get that hot message it will invest in something cool it was gonna invest in something cool yeah maybe who knows I think we got to invest more yeah verse five man diversify yeah I think we're pretty diversified right now yeah everyone thank you hey how much you upload a fucking video stop trying to go over this stupid fucking Mouse how about that how about that bud how about you upload a video it's so true man I filmed one yesterday and I just did I don't know I didn't feel good about it I gotta watch the footage but I I don't think it's good so I don't think I have whited nose and I what the fuck has been going on with that I hate one of them okay but you know I'll um I'll give it a second look I have another one that I'm working on with Noah and he has a cut that I have to review and then we have our big big big love island ten that that one is tough just fucking make that one happen brother I think I'm gonna make that one happen but just so everybody knows it's a fucking hour-long coding I played for an hour straight and it wasn't like an hour of like bullshitting it was like we were playing for an hour yeah so and it was a fun one too is a big big old twisty twist dude I do have to roll the whole time is in 45 minutes and I got to get over there because it's in Sherman Sherman chokes you finna be late Sherman chokes Sherman chokes dude Sherman chad's let me just see how long it take you to get this Sherman Oaks right now it's gonna take oh no no we're fine we're fine gucchi yeah we gonna shoot for a little bit yeah now you got to be thinking about what our fucking gaming product could be what you got me thinking what could our gaming product be I know that's what I'm saying we need to get into this maybe we should just start a team dude a WoW team literally couldn't compete phase could do that right now and just shit all over us we have no power you don't even have the money to get into this arena that's the thing it's like so expensive to get into gaming now I still wonder how faze works yeah I don't know that should work I don't know I used to love when people at our previous employer no names will be named would go on and on about the genius of the phase members you remember this no okay I can't get into this story without I don't know brought in like crazy okay but he was talking about yeah no he he just he just understands the the business so well he really understands gaming and what it's all about I'm like no he doesn't it's not a fucking clue what he's talking about yeah he kinda did at a point but you know he doesn't yeah now he's just fuckin I'm just wondering like do they get a salary like a lot of the guys don't even gain um what so do they get paid by phase or how are they involved I I think the phase is probably just for them works it's like a management company yeah I bring brand deals and that's probably where a lot of their money comes from I think phase like started as like a gaming team and then they saw how much money was in like these sort of influencer yeah aspect yeah cuz phase is like like gaming like fucking how would I describe their demo it's like the same type of kids that watch like rice gum and shit yeah being part of phase sounds really cool yeah although I will say phases so now with fucking this investment from offsetting weather and they have some other like like a little yadi or whatever joined didn't he yeah it's a clean phase yeah it's like they're doing well as far as like making a phase like a like even more of a brand name and and honestly phase does they do pickup good players yeah even Nick Marx is on phase now oh yes yeah no I think and that was like there's some drama there because I think he had like it's kind of like he was like with hundred thieves from the beginning and it was the people are debating that they kind of stiffed him but they they should have took care of him better like as a friend and like a supporter like maybe he didn't sign anything on paper but like the good business move would have been like it's fucking Nick Marx like he's a huge streamer like why wouldn't you give him some percentage and like make him happy mhm and so for him to walk cuz I think he was like good friends with the hundred thieves guys mmm-hmm so yeah phased as well in that capacity so I think they were more like a management company now it makes sense I guess that makes sense I don't I don't think they're so much of a gaming organization that makes sense not like fucking liquid or like any one of these other teams yeah so it's crazy because teams in counter-strike those are teams that have been around for like 10-15 years mhm like legitimately that long like ninjas in pyjamas mm-hm since I was like you know a little seaman because I'm 16 so it'll seems I was a little senior it's a tiny little scene with legs a little I love seamen yeah oh my semen I love to see man I love semen
