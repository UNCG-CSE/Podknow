little less than two months ago we announced the campaign to flip the Senate and we are the only campaign that's focused solely on this emergency task of flipping the Senate from conservative control cuz there's very little that we can ever get done certainly if Trump wins and still controls the Senate we're in a world of hurt Jose Trump loses in your favorite Democrat wins but we don't control the Senate there's a next to nothing that will be able to get done so today we're announcing for more candidates we've already endorsed 7 candidates we're announcing for more to add to my list to flip the Senate going to tell you all about those States and all about those campaigns in those candidates but also want to linger for a minute on some things that I see happening that concern me some old strategies and old habits that if we don't break them is not going to be any flipping the Senate and it's not going to be any winning the presidency so let's do this is Shawn Kinglistening to the breakdown the breakdown breakdown earlier this week in North Carolina there were two special elections I believe for the Third District of North Carolina in the 9th District of North Carolina there were two special elections for congressional seats cuz of all the dirty dealing and and foulness that's been going on with the Republican party there in North Carolina they actually had to run these elections over because Republicans ran the previous elections in so many underhanded ways that ultimately they had to completely do them over which is crazy which is a sign of the state of our democracy but there was something there that happened in this one you know this year 2019 that deeply concerned mean one was expected to be a blowout I think that was in the 3rd District of North Carolina Republicans were widely expected to win that and they want it was a blowout it wasn't closed but any other one in the 9th District a man named Dan McCready was running and a lot of Democrats thought that he could win and a lot of people held that election up as a sign of what's to come in 2020 and depending on who you ask there are a lot of different responses on what the election results mean and just for a minute before we get into our new candidates that we are backing to help us flip the Senate I want to give us a bit of an alarming take because Donald Trump of course he went to North Carolina first off and he had huge campaign rallies for these candidates and he gave them a big boost there in the end and the Republicans won both of those those elections and any Democrat who's telling you but they weren't fighting to win the one particularly in the 9th of Dan McCready they're lying like they thought they could win and thought it was a real possibility that they could win and Trump really needed those wins very badly to say like hate we are still resonating in a place like North Carolina where a Democrat is not Governor but Republicans control the legislature Republicans control the Senate seats there in North Carolina and Trump helped fuel those campaigns to Victory and some Democrats are spinning it and I don't completely discount it now the one where there was a blowout That was supposed to happen but the one where Democrats lost by 2 percentage points in the 9th congressional district which includes part of Charlotte Democrats are saying hey Trump won this District by 11 percentage points in 2016 and the fact that now are Congressional candidate only lost by 2 percentage points is an improvement and I kind of get that but this election which already happened in 2018 was actually closer in 2018 so in some ways Trump games Bolts game support and at a time where Democrats needed to show up and win the race it just didn't happen I I think there are some challenges with the candidate to be frank that didn't really resonate he has no electoral history there in the state and has never won election before and we see Democrats the Democratic party in particular kind of trying to find these Bland middle-aged white man who never run for office and then trying to kind of shape and make them into something that they want them to be and I have a problem with that in the how they're doing it like sometimes you need to find people who have at least run for office before who understands how these campaigns work but Democrats lost both of those and part of what I'm trying to communicate the people just hate the Democratic party itself does not have all of the answers and a huge part of that is why we started this campaign to flip the senate in 2016 and in 2018 Democrats actually lost seats even in the Blue Wave I put kind of are quotation marks around that in the Blue Wave of 2018 Democrats lost several more seats in the Senate even while they gained seats in a lot of other places and so we started this campaign. bus flip the Senate because we don't trust everybody else with the future of the country and they can continue to fight for things the way they fight for them but we have to use some of the strategies and organizing tactics that we know are going to work until today I want to tell you more about where we are with a flip the Senate campaign and introduce you to the next or candidates that we are doing all right let's break it down first and foremost thank you so much to the thousands of volunteers that are already helping with our flipped Senate campaign we love and appreciate you have volunteers literally working around the clock and I'm grateful to each of you so if you're listening thank you from me to you for your hard work we can do this and thank you to the thousands and thousands of donors who chipped in to even help us build this organization to flip the Senate now there are seven candidates that we've already endorsed and quickly out introduced them to you and then tell you about the four more that we are about to endorse we have endorsed in Texas and this is the first primary so far that's coming in March of 2020 of any of the candidates we've been divorced I think that's on super Tuesday in Texas and we've endorsed Cristina tzintzun Ramirez in Texas we have endorsed my friend Ted Terry who is the mayor of Clarkston Georgia and a he's in Georgia the primary is I think on May 19th we've been doing the secretary of state of New Mexico Maggie Oliver and her primary is in June we've endorsed Wilmot Collins who was the mayor of Helena Montana is primary is also in June we have endorsed Jamie Harrison in South Carolina a June primary Andrew Romanoff in Colorado of whose primary is at the end of June and then James May blur in Tennessee whose primary is all the way in August and I hate that they have Push some of these primary so far out those very late primaries benefit the incumbent in a lot of ways and we're proud though that James is running and that's going to give him more time to campaign all over the state so those are the candidates we've already endorsed and the states that we've already endorsed them in and many of you are not donating to their campaigns you are following them across social media but now let me tell you about the new candidates that we're supporting the first candidate that we are endorsing the First new candidate on top of the seven that were already supporting is Erica Smith of North Carolina and I am so proud to support Erica and I've been able to talk with her and get to know her she is an engineer and an educator she's actually currently serving her third term representing District 3 and North Carolina State Senate she is an amazing organizer and activist and thinker to the first woman to ever represent the district in the States history she is the second Vice chair of the North Carolina legislative Black Caucus and if elected Erica Smith would be the first African-American senator from North Carolina ever and so we believe in her we believe that her policies and her views are her platform Focus has a lot on investing in education and infrastructure to begin closing the rule Urban divide she wants to expand Medicaid she is backing Common Sense gun control legislation and Republicans are already afraid of her because in multiple polls Erica is already pulling well in that race at and so much so that one pole has her winning by I think six points and Republicans are already targeting her trying to make her out to be a radical like AOC or ilhan Omar and they are putting Billboards around North Carolina with Erica Smith alongside our friends the two women that we love and support a Meijer Alexandria ocasio-cortez and ilhan Omar and here's what I'm saying you could do a lot worse than the compared to those women who are change agents who are speaking truth to power and who are widely loved in their districts and so we are proud proud proud to support Erica Smith and her race come the next senator of North Carolina and let me tell you about three other candidates no I believe in running in all 50 states and I don't believe in there ever being any Senate races where Democrats just sit out because they think they can't win because in many states right now they are democratic Governors and senators in places where Trump did win I'm thinking of West Virginia I'm thinking of Louisiana I mean there are places like that where Trump won it also have a Democratic senator or a Democratic governor and there is a state that people say is just reliably red but people are frustrated in Arkansas and we are proud to support and endorse Joshua Mahony Joshua is a great guy he is a native of Arkansas he is a natural resources executive use a small business owner he's deeply familiar with all the challenges facing entrepreneurs and local business including just the rising cost of healthcare to all the difficulties there in Arkansas to attract and retain a skilled Workforce he is fighting for I increase wages and is standing up for everyday people all over Arkansas in a way that they just don't have right now A Josh first ran for office in 2018 and one of the most historically Republican districts of the state and during that campaign 17,000 more Democrats showed up at The Ballot Box and they didn't the previous election he is doing the hard work of visiting every County every city district to District a Joshua Mahony has a great guy we are proud to support him in Arkansas and here's the thing you lose every fight you're not in so if you don't fight for a seat in Arkansas guess what you're going to lose and we are going to be fighting in every state no matter what the polls say no matter what people predict and Joshua is doing the hard work is putting in the hard work when right there in his native state of Arkansas Joshua Mahoney's the man let me know about two more candidates that we have we are super super proud to support Paula Jean swearengin from West Virginia and Paula Jean is widely known as one of the people whose campaign was chronicled in the documentary that you can see now on Netflix knock down the house when she first ran for US Senate in 2018 where she lost to incumbent ex-governor Joe manchin but I actually got 30% of the vote in the primary she's a Coal Miner's Daughter and coal miner's granddaughter who became an activist when her grandfather died from Black Lung I actually have family who worked in Coal Mines their whole lives and in Eastern Kentucky and in West Virginia and Paula Jean believes that West Virginia's have paid continue to pay way too high of a price for coal in the health of their people in the streams polluted with toxins and tops blown off of mountains and she wants to build a sustainable future there in West Virginia with clean and safe jobs she is a supporter of medicare-for-all she is a fierce advocate for ending corruption in Washington chinos the essential I'll fight to get Broadband access to all communities and we proudly support Paula Jean she's the bomb I believe in her her character integrity or fight and we are so so glad that she is in the race please follow Paula Jean across social media she's a great follow and a just has the determination that it takes to win this seat and that is her race the election is on May 12th and so why we say hey we have 400 days until November 8th 2020 these candidates don't necessarily have 100 days their primaries are far sooner than that so please follow Paula Jean and if you have not already Watch the documentary knock down the house it's going to it's going to encourage you and inspire you in every way we have one more candidate to tell you about last but absolutely certainly not least we are proud to support and endorse my friend Kimberly Graham of Iowa I've gotten to know Kimberly here over the past few months we spoke just yesterday and she is a brilliant attorney there in Iowa who advocates for abused and neglected children in the juvenile court system and she would take that passion for children all the way to the Senate we need lifelong advocates for kids in the Senate because kids don't have a voice in the Senate so they need people who have already made it their mission to fight for children and that's what Kimberly Graham would be in the city she has lived in rural Iowa for the past twenty-four years and she seen firsthand how Family Farms are struggling with rising cost she has seen first-hand all over the sea Iowa how the opioid and meth epidemics are damaging communities and how skyrocketing medical costs are bankrupting family is all over the country she is a proud supporter of medicare-for-all the green New Deal serious Criminal Justice Reform a $15 minimum wage like she is the candidate that we want we are so proud to support her she just like many of the other candidates that we support is already being attacked by Republicans because they know that when people hear the message they know and understand that a candidate like Kimberly Graham is going to resonate she has visited now I think she told me yesterday over 30 different counties in Iowa for more than her opponents and a we are so proud of the campaign and she is running we believe in Kimberly and we are supporting her right there in Iowa to help us with the Senate and let me tell you some impossible we go today what I'm about to share is such a hard lesson
