And welcome to another episode of that sounds fun I'm your host Annie F Downs so happy to be here with you today hey the music in the background is from our good buddy mr. Drew Holcomb make sure you check out his new album Dragon I have the vinyl and it is spinning at my house I'm like loving it so much so make sure you get a copy of that today on that show I'm so excited about that you guys we have had just a tiny bit of an influx meaning what other person from Food Network on our show lately and today we have New York Times bestselling author cookbook writer and Food Network star winner Melissa d'Arabian she also if you remember Food Network had a show called $10 dinners and that was her and I love that show she has a new book out this week called tasting Grace and Valencia been around awhile you know that my relationship with food can be beautiful and complicated and until when someone writes a book like tasting Grace all about God and food and and connections there I'm just about it and then it's also a Food Network person that I adore I'm so excited I hope you guys enjoy this conversation with my new friend and author of tasting Grace Melissa d'Arabian the part I haven't told you that Melissa is I'm kind of a superfan do you know this is probably already I like love watching you on Food Network I think you're so fun to watch her first show was the first thing you did Food Network star yes yes cuz in my brain are thought I remembered you because I said to Jennifer you guys like she's kind of Food Network OG like you've been around Food Network for a while I was 10 years ago this week that I bet my winning was aired on Food Network okay yeah so yeah you've been awhile since day one but as of America Works Spring baking Championship he was awesome what I was going to say is what I loved about him is he and what I learn learning with it like you win months before you get to tell anybody before and 10 years ago it was a whole different tell me five or ten key points is that our listeners know that nobody's on the show that I'm not friends with her want to be friends and so it's never a trial to to know who you are and to read your product and I think so yeah yeah yeah yeah it's different now I mean the reality TV was different and it was really a reality TV shows I knew I had one and I had filmed the first season of $10 dinners for maybe four or five months before I won on it was and yeah I camera so back then it was much earlier it was it just there was a longer yeah. The fact when I filmed $10 dinners the first season when I was in New York filming it I had to wear a disguise I was wearing a wig and sunglasses the whole time I was in New York like an elevator is like going up at Chelsea Market like completely do people do that now probably like a lot in New York who Network star you know I'm but the truth is also at that point I haven't even started airing so I mean it was I didn't know cuz that was that was like an April and start started airing in June so they had announced the cast but I wasn't even on TV yet so if everybody was just a very different and I already told to hold our dinner so much so I left him a fun idea and you know it's and I only spent $10 sounds like she is really in my heart because I I shot that show a movie from my heart and I took those too tight AZ idea it was it was I will say this but the title was Food Network's idea and insistence I had a different title in mine and I fought and lost and then they ended up being right so I put this is my background and I really believe that we can all dig into what is truly our background and bring that to share at the table. Be a Food Network table or figurative table are real table and I grew up with very little money and I grew up with a mom who stretched a dollar so so wanting to share strategies for feeding our families on a budget with something that was very important to me and I felt deeply so when we when we price. All of the episodes if we were $0.08 over I would kind of let that go but but I mean I I would like I want to see our Excel spreadsheet model and I want to run them up numbers Myself & I we priced out every single recipe and we did it by calling three different grocery stores Across the Nation now that part I didn't do there was an intern who did but but my point is if I change my recipes and I really wanted people to Great Hobbies recipes that more than that you know for making Fish download it and use it but I really want them to learn what are the strategies for cooking fish on a budget and like how do you source that how do you buy that where do you buy it where you know what's the best way to do that I want people to see their grocery store Bell go down in general not just use my inexpensive recipes sure about a bigger story than that so $10 dinners is a really heartfelt show to me and one that was rooted in stewardship it really was never about go by and you know Ramen and eat it cuz right about that it was really about leaning into seasonality and and understanding the grocery store sales cycle and being good stewards of our financial resources but also our Earth's resources in the Leaning anti-god seasonality so $10 dinners it's a catchy title and its budget and it's a great promise that invites people in but it's about so much more than that to me that is amazing what will you believe her before you started working on the show and before you're doing Food Network guess the short answer to that is yes I think that what has been I now realize in 50 years looking back on my life gift is that I I don't ever remember a moment where I didn't believe in God I don't ever remember a moment now if I were to sort of look over my life and say were there were there moments where my face was strengthened and changed and depend absolutely and if I could talk a little bit about that and tasting Grace how you know different points of my life led to different struggles and in moments of a face waning and also Faith deepening but luckily I was blessed with just always believing and and I think I think that really comes down to the gift of feeling in my gut even when I was too young to expresses of feeling like faith and doubt can coexist and just because I have have doubt doesn't mean my face goes away and in fact faith is a gift and again I couldn't Express that but the fact that I have always doubted poked holes wondered sometimes but like there was like a phase where I thought I was like his like Jesus just like an imaginary friend like I had growing up you know like how I had an imaginary friend named shape and I haven't had another one named pop rubber baby rubber baby shape and Jesus and they're all imaginary friends that I'm just walking around pretending and the fact that I've been comfortable with that music but not having let go of my face is I realize just a gift and I don't know how else to express that so to answer your question yes I was I was a believer in a Christian before Food Network so thank goodness for me through Food Network star without God there's no way I would have there's just no way I Serta God because you're left there without an again 10 years ago is a little bit different I don't know what all the rules are now but it was a little bit different in that there was no I mean you couldn't have any books or any anything any your phone all of that for 7 weeks I mean just in your living and no house no books no magazines no TV nothing nothing as a sign. I remembered this is how seriously they took it it would if I was at Food Network star during the inauguration of Obama which was a very historic moment right we were we were not allowed to watch that on TV that's how seriously they took the note E D policy so I say that not as a way of complaining but to say it was a very isolating experience they just wanted you with the competitors and again we were filmed all the time in the house right because that was part of the part of the the show back then so if I had not had God to lean on during that time and during that stress I wouldn't have I wouldn't have I would have done it in a while I don't mean winning I mean just emotionally the good news is that when you take away everything that you're used to leaning on in life like your family your friends your books or whatever you know you can always turn inward to God and you are not allowed to have the Bible your lot of other stuff but I think Bibles were not an exception I don't believe so I recall having my my journal we were allowed to write things so I would write you know that recipe well and I would write down like ideas or whatever you want to let have any recipes with you or anything but I remember that journal in being able to put in there my prayer my you know my my thoughts to God I could write out scripture that I had memorized so it was a very very inward-facing time even though it's crazy because like you're on camera and all of this but it was it was a lot of alone time between me and God because that was that was sort of a noisy crazy place to be so yes thank goodness for me I had my face I don't think that I would have enjoyed that. As much as I did I actually really I found that I found that. While difficult and stressful also very transformative and Redemptive not in the win but in the experience so I I loved my time on Food Network star I really did it was it was a special time and I came out of Food Network star a different person in terms of my relationship with God and the deepening of that relationship and I talked a little about it in in tasting Grace that when we had those challenges going in and just facing those ingredients without any prep time without any recipes without any time to think I just found got an ingredients and so leading into the the prayer that that cooking can be if we're leading into God's ingredients that was that was my experience and talk more about that Corey said cooking it cuz obviously food is medicine and Corey said but I would say cooking as medicine and so tell me what you mean when you say that cooking is prayer I think for me one of the gifts of Food Network star but also just one of the greater Gifts of cooking in general is that we can take these ingredients that that we see God's fingerprints on and we could we get to continue that creation when we talk so we we get to step up to the pallet that God has laid out for us and continued his work continued his Masterpiece and I think there's something very poetic about us continuing God's creation in ingredients that mimics what we're told is Christian's that we're doing great continuing the work of Jesus continuing God's love here on Earth and Norm Wars by his a theologian who he talks about how food is God's love made delicious I love that it's God's love made delicious so we can take that food and add to so the work and the creation and the beauty that God gave us so kind of prayer and worship me and an opportunity to connect in to God if I just step back enough to give the food that space and that was the challenge for me on Food Network star is right you got 2 cameras go go go go go up arms up whatever whatever and it just stopped and sort of say Okay God it's you and me and these ingredients whatever happens with the competition is sort of none of my business but it's you and me and I'm here to continue the creation and we are all creators right whether it be with food or you know whatever so continuing the creation was really a big gift of a Food Network star for me I think one of the things I love about your well let's say this there are a lot of people listening and I am probably the president of them to have some real issues with food and like relationship with food and what food has been and hasn't been I have PCOS and so my body handles food really weirdly often I'm allergic to Dairy I don't need a lot of gluten weirdo when it comes to food and also there's the emotional thing with food that is really hard for me and so I've been thrilled to have you on and talk about tasting Grace because I feel like you have such a beautiful understanding and balance of and you talk so much about your own like when food was off-balance for you and when food has not been so so talk a little bit about how that happened with food and why has why is the enemy tried to steal the beauty of food from us okay so first of all let me just let me just bust the myth that that I'm in this balanced place oh I had this sort of struggling question I brooded about it in the scripture for a couple of years which I did do and now it's fixed and good so let me tell you what I did to fix it let's let's just bust bust that meth but what I think is so exciting to me is when I when I talk with you and and then people like us right I'm hearing I'm hearing Melissa you're not alone so I love that so thank you but I'm also hearing we are not alone and so we need to talk about this so that's what I'm hearing and everybody thinks everybody else is balancing with their relationship anybody who doesn't have a weird feeling about food is complicated because we all need it and yet we also all want it and you can't cold-turkey it can't just step away from from food and just not eat food we have to learn to navigate to eat food with you know it is in the right and I'm putting air quest vanilla can see it except you in the right way right or in a way that feels good that feels that is it for for a lack of any better way of saying it that that we feel like God wants us to to have food in our lives and to sort of right size that relationship now that's what writing tasting Grace because I felt so off balance in a lot of ways as a as a child who didn't have enough food there's part of me that wants to anytime I see food like I want to buy instinct is to load up at the buffet or whatever there's food at what if I may not always be available so there's that part of me then you know as women wear in society that you know that we have all of these ads that sort of say essentially if you eat you no sugar and chemicals you'll be happy and be this wonderful person and then we are also told by society that if we do eat sugar or we do eat a piece of pie that we need to go work it off at the gym throw that in as punishment for food I love how you write about that about the balance of exercise and food that we treat them like a seesaw and they can just both be true so there are lots of ways in which food can be tricky for us we had feel guilty because we're not making meals at in 06 for a family is but then we thought you there's guilt culture is it at that and and I love I love it when Jen hatmaker says whenever she thinks about like buying something or she's getting an advertisement she thinks for herself who is making money off of a paraphrasing money off of this powerful and important and that is that the enemy is at work here and the simple truth is that Satan does his best work in half-truths he does his best work in half-truths and in the food space those half-truths we are so primed and ready to take in those half-truths so for instance in the world of exercise and eating well yes we are meant to exercise we are not meant to be gluttons and overeat and eat tons and tons of food and we are meant to exercise that's that's the truth right the half-truth is the what what what Satan loves do is take that little tiny negative truth and wrap a big fat liar and turn it into skinny is good you know working out will absolve you from the guilt of you eating a piece of pie or whatever so it's it's these half-truths that we think we're in the gym because we are going to that's good to do right it's good to be healthy but the tricky part is the slippery slope is that if we're honest are we in the gym because we feel guilty about what we ate yesterday or were trying to quote a quote earn our our lunch today or are we in the gym because we're actually really just trying to get skinny for a bikini or whatever and I'm hurting myself my own head so that's what is tricky about food is it's it's it's an area that so full of half-truths that we can buy into and it's complicated and messy and emotional and and then guess what we're in the middle of this emotional mess and lunch comes and we got to eat again and we don't even have time to step back and figure it out and that's what tasting Grace was for me to something something is not right with this and I need to figure it out because because I'm not I'm not living God's best for me when it comes to food did not include the way I was thinking and feeling about food and not in in big huge crazy ways but in those small and sidious ways that Society cosine and actually encourages me to get money off of it so it was a very is a set of subtle half-truths but I noticed in my life of food that I could not reconcile on my own and I thought if I'm having a hard time with this may be someone else's too so that's when I I I mean I spent several years and in early morning prayer devotional tears in a feeling good feeling not good up down around all of that all of that and then wrote about it and and I would love to say that then the answer is okay you wrote about it and now you're good to go for me really is a daily reprieve and it only comes from staying really super close to God that's that's that's probably true I would say for me in life maybe there's some people who can get really close to God and then Bank it up and then they're good for 3 weeks that's not my experience for me it's a daily reprieve and everything that I do yeah I find this conversation is so much easier for me with someone who loves cooking and loves food versus someone who like rent the gym cuz I'm always like yeah we're going to have to eat you got to tell me how to do this I can't not now I don't have to go to gym and go to walk it at the trails at Radnor Lake I can do all sorts of things but you and I are on the same page that I have to eat I don't have a choice that's right that's right and so we have to face this complicated thing it is it's complicated now there's also some good news hear the good news is that when I turn to God for information about what he saying about food there is there's a lot of good news yeah and there's a lot of God using food to bring us closer to him so the good news is that when I'm kind of person out all these weird messages in life the ones the ones that make me feel bad the ones that are coming from God don't make me feel bad you how do you tell the difference so well that's a very big how did how do we know if it's if it's us which is tricky business right for me or everyone has to figure out what other voices is God's voice what other voice is one of their voices in their head is their own voice yeah so that's sort of that bigger question but for me Discerning God's voice on food versus society's voice on food my ability to discern is proportional to how much time per day I'm spending in devotional and prayer and a time with God and and I wish I could have a better way of saying listen well this is what God's voice sounds like and this is what societies voice sounds like but the reality is it's from me it's about training myself in discernment and training and discernment comes from Daily Devotional prayer and reading God's word the more I do that the better able IM to discern and that's why is because unfortunately my Discerning my discernment it goes away pretty quickly if I am so it's really no secret that if I let my morning devotional time go it's only a matter of a couple of days until my mind starts telling me things that are negative not just in the food space but in you no self-esteem in wanting to do things in life I can be everything like for me there's just there's no secret the number one best daily habit that I can have more than what I eat more than you know exercise all those what those are great ways for me to feel better the number one have it for me is my daily morning devotional time and if it goes away after a few days not only do I feel it but people around me go I say that a lot of knows when I'm not yes with me on that she knows and I will say this that in terms of the food messages now say that's if you're just sort of trying to get o gets rid of a litmus test I will say this in general the mess food messages coming from God or ones that bring people together that bring me closer to God to my original purpose to the take me back to who I was in Genesis 1 he does a the worker that Adam and Eve they were meant to be in tending the garden the Creator we were created to be so when I feel like I'm drawn closer in to God and to who Jesus was with food into bringing people together then chances are that is probably more message from God if it's a message that is more separating and if I think in marinade in in something long and if I can get a sense for whether something is more separating then bringing together so if I say to you as I used to I would say this on Food Network all the time you know impress your friends with this in over this easy recipe and pressing our friends is that a message of separation or one of unification it's really separation in the right and pressing means put yourself up on a pedestal it's a small pedestal I get it we're talking about chicken piccata chicken piccata just can separate you from your family and friends if the intention is impressing that separating so really looking at is this separating or bringing people together and bringing me closer to God that is probably my the best litmus if you're looking for a quick take an answer that would be it but it really comes down to that deep discernment hey Francis interrupt in listen to keep talking about food and talk about practice you guys know I love practitioner love Allison tribit prep dishes my new secret weapon for healthy stress free meals produces a meal planning service and every week you get an email with a grocery list and prep ahead instructions so all your meals are ready for the week no guesswork needed you'll do your chopping and mixing ahead of time leaving you it's like zero decisions we made it dinner if you have a crazy schedule this is such a good time saver whether it's you or your family or whoever you feel like a super bomb or a super friend or a super wife or super husband because you're going to be like superhuman when you serve these amazingly delicious meals like like their turkey and zucchini lasagna that I found a free two-week trial to try it out you can't beat that to check out prep dish.com Annie for this amazing deal dish has gluten free paleo and keto options so if that matters to you this is a great place to go look so I can go to prep dish.com Annie for your first two weeks free and now back to the show so in the morning when the things people ask a lot when we talked about this devotional time with God this personal time there's two questions one is what does it look like in the other is can you do it at night the second the second question is faster yes if I can find that 30 minutes in the morning versus 30 minutes at night but I'm also like I think God wants to spend time with you whenever you want to totally agree with you and and so you know I am of that you do you at the reason why I make the case for the morning is that there is a there's sort of an Afterglow of devotional time and by the way I would say the same thing is true of exercise yeah you had those endorphins but true for both but in different ways into different degrees so I'm not equating the two but but I would also make the case for morning exercise but there's an Afterglow that comes with devotional time that I am just Kinder I am wiser I am better at Discerning God's voice the closer I am to devotional time so for me I feel like why we stopped during sleeping so why not have that extra wisdom or help or peace a connection with God as I go through and make conscious decisions throughout my day whereas if I'm sleeping then for me you know I'm sort of on autopilot I don't have to discernment I like I can do that for me I get more out of it if I do it in the morning up but same thing with exercise as a side note you can exercise whenever but I feel great for that unit 8 or 10 hours after I exercise so why not be awake for that that's why I feel like so anything important that I want to do I do in the morning cuz I want to enjoy the benefits so is your devotional time look like do you read a book do you read your Bible do you Journal really varies my devotional time varies and I have different devotional sort of tracks going so I could have three different things that I do one as I usually have sort of an area of special interest that I'm always reading about in the Bible so for instance for the past few years that has been food and how God is using food in live yeah so I will read sections of the Bible related to a topic but I find interesting and a personal growth area the second thing that I always have sort of going in my track in the second track I was have going is I'm always reading the Bible like three like a Alexa read YouVersion. I just I always have that I'm always tracking on that right well read a chapter 2 of that got to keep that going but that would be unrelated to anything in the other thing that I do is I will often have a devotion but I'm working through so I will pop in and do that and then the fourth thing I do is unusually part of a Bible study so they always have their things that they're looking at so I kind of feel like we just did it on your breath more homework call Marquez or whatever that is so that's part of the fourth track I don't do all for every day and when I travel that might look different yet I do travel with my big huge pink Bible when I travel with my boyfriend and I need the big one and I need it to adjust I want I want it all in one place I want to read the Bible from the last place I read the Bible where I have those last notes so I don't do all for every day I usually do two of those four and it kind of depends on what mood I'm in but those are going out for books going to pick up in a room that's not me but I have four devotional tracks and I but I have to do at least one of those at least one of those yeah I have to I just love it I love thank you for sharing that with us cuz I think one of the reasons we stall out on doing those things is because we don't know if we're doing the quote right thing so then when we get to hear all these different people and what their devotions look like and what hearing God looks like for them no matter where you are in your face journey and go there's an app I can read you version and oh yeah you can I listen to audiobook of the Bible in chronological order but I do which doesn't your family Melissa well you know it's sort of a 4B because it doesn't replace any of my other emotional stuff but you is I love to have some Christian Author some books by Christian authors sure I've been thinking of for instance your book or I loved her present over perfect Asana yoga so after I do my devotional if it's like a weekend or if I can I love two than just beat someone else's Christian book and it's just like a fun little treats her today in between the the the work and thinking and marinating in God's word into like my normal life is like a call I got to go take the kids to school or whatever and I can get it but but I do love that so I always have like a like a like a like a fun Christian book that I'm kind of reading your first one event like that cuz your grace is is my first evening box around but I love morning reading I love reading with coffee and I don't like coffee at night so I kind of have to read in the morning I love that okay so what is the things I loved about taking Grace cuz why do have a pretty long extensive history with food issues I also am kind of a foodie like I love beautiful food I'm an Enneagram 7 style of experience I want to like I want to order everything on the menu and try everything that's what I made my friends and I went to Loveless Cafe while you're in town you should maybe try to get the love I saw your post that you see how far is it from the air can we go and do whatever I know that's it's it's a little bit you wrote about was about what how foodie culture has changed and how I want to read the the subtitle of the chapter foodie culture may be chipping away at God's food culture Melissa tell me what you're talkin about a practice all of this I love food as art I love chefs and a some of my best friends are restaurant chefs and they are amazing I talked about Richard blais and I love already I I love already so much parenthetically already and I have been tight friends since the day she was on Food Network star and we act after she won Food Network Star but wasn't out at the winner of Food Network star we both ran Atlantic City and we met I can pull up a rendezvous we're like she took the elevator up and I took the elevator up at separate times so that we can get together and like talking inside of it and she's been such a Artie is is the person that even when I was ready tasting Grace that you know that I can call her we will pray on the phone together and everything from you know we've called each other and pray together and and like the you know the shop dressing room should have called her from her from the parking lot of like a big meeting where I was that can we just pray before we go in or we get I mean they can and I will do the same for her so we I just so yes I know how hard I've Loved Richard blais I'm a fan of his work I know like real life friendship stories via RT Richard who is offended mean he's he's here and think I just need to drink in his gift and his Artistry and yet but I also just love about Richard is he is so unimpressed with with his his he's just he's as good as writer make the neck up he's just he's amazing I just love him but when I watch Richard in the kitchen I may I stand back and I'm in awe of this god-given gift I love restaurant chefs I think what is tricky and is not their fault is that Society has become so obsessed with a restaurant Chef we've created this new category of celebrity chef which by the way I realize the irony of me sort of being lumped into it happen for Christians right right so they're all sorts of problems right when we put anybody on a pedestal of any sort of you know where anything on a pedestal when you put creation above the Creator that has its own car on but when it when it comes to foodie culture we have created this world where the restaurant Chef has become the if not the only voice certainly the most valued voice in food so we have made restaurant worthy meals and fancy plating and swooshes sort of the the standard by which a a home cook measures herself or himself and I think that's where it becomes a little bit dangerous is where we start making that Artistry our lettuce for whether we are succeeding or failing in the kitchen and regular looking at everybody else's brunch pictures Eggs only by that I mean let's let's let's talk about the term foodporn remove the the joy and connectedness that comes from the work the worthy work of putting a meal on the table for our family every single night and we say that we must make it with Fancy Sushi and we must put filters on it and has to be Instagram worthy or restaurant where they are in the language of device which Bible say separating it's separating and and and and by the way artists like Richard blais never used that separating language sharing their genius and their art and their wonderfulness so Society is bringing in this half-truth yes which is that their food is beautiful it's meant to be shared restaurants are wonderful place to go and and meet with friends and there's so much good there and and we Co-op that small truth and turn it into oh I feel like crap because this my meatloaf does not look like something I put on Instagram there's a problem the problem is that Meatloaf is wonderful and so is Richard blais is fancy plating both of those are wonderful and and and we're missing that we are missing out on the joy that I think God wants us to have it food so who else would you celebrate next to the celebrity chefs when it comes to making a meal who else would you go okay if I could have an entire Instagram account just to celebrating people who make a meal happen who else are you going to celebrate besides the Richard what listen and anybody who's dealing with all of us and everybody yeah yeah yes the mom putting dinner on the table and everyday at 6 the dad putting dinner on the table every 6 it's not even the dinner on the table that they go into the kitchen and spend an hour cooking it is also for buying gets a rotisserie chicken and puts it out there and gets up a lettuce and opens up a you know a can of corn and serves it to their family whatever it is the point is let's celebrate the food we eat 99% of the time not just the one percent of going and witnessing beautiful Artistry which I love I love that artist but that is not 90% or 99 but it's not the majority of how we eat food and how we deal with food and it is not the majority of how God relates to us through food so when we ignored food and God and we just say well let's let's just talk about food as art which is a valuable thing I thought everything we're missing out on what God gave us food for which is to bring us together to bring us closer to him to bring us into worthy work to bring us into patients to invite us into all the other patients yeah about that recipe shortcuts an invitation to Patient so I'll tell people cuz I'm not going to make you talk about your book is on but taking Grace each chapter is an invitation to something it's it's a way that food invite to send in one of the invitations you gave us was in a patient's right and we think of patience is being kind of like something we don't want to be invited into time because the good news is that we are invited into these things like patients even things we think we don't want because they actually do deliver God's best for us and that crazy I know in about Ratatouille living in France change the way I eat and an introduced this type of American Corporate America personality that I am into a new way of thinking about food and that happened both living in Paris where I work and also then dating and eventually marrying Philippe who had on the south of France which takes French cuisine and French patients into a whole new level of it's just it's just a whole new level over over Paris and Philippe's mom Muriel my mother-in-law she really introduced me into the patience of of food and introduced me into the patience of not only sitting around the table which is part of that food conversation right by the way sitting around the table has been the the bulk of the Christian conversation food for a very long time around the table food brings people together and that is great but that is only part of God's way of using food with us and that's that's that's why rotating basis to explore in that and other ways yeah but one of the guests that I received from my mother-in-law was a lesson in how to make perfect Ratatouille in a Ratatouille is a typical French or Mediterranean dish with vegetables that we sometimes make in the US but apparently we make in the US all wrong. I didn't realize it until I until I had my lesson with my French mother-in-law who is from the south of France and she told me that the secret to a good Ratatouille is that all of the vegetables must be cooked separately and then combined so that the flavors would each stand on their own Statesville it takes a lot and not only must they be cooked separately but in a specific order in order to build the flavors correctly cuz you're going to cut them separately but in the same pan out a bunch of pants and I will tell you the order so and I remember it by calling it easy pot like I had a Ratatouille so if eggplant zucchini peppers onions tomatoes so that's the order onion tomatoes in a little olive oil maybe sometime if you want do that in order and to to cook each vegetable individually so it doesn't lose its place and the overall dish yeah there's such beauty and that isn't there that we want to honor each ingredient that God gave us and let it have its place and have build the flavors together and do them in order that takes an amount of patients I didn't know that I had and well it's so I will tell you I had every intention of going to moving it along when I made it myself and I will tell you I I make it always anywhere I almost 15 years or more than that gets 15 years little longer but even want to find out I don't know that so I take it you know what question can we just slow down anyway but can we not all the time I get it less busy but can we find the worthiness and slowing down just a little bit to make each vegetable had its place I can we do that maybe not all the time but sometimes and I think we can that feels really good I'm like oh yeah that's a really good correction it doesn't matter if it tastes better what if we just slow down because it's right and what if what if the food is meant to slow us down a little bit maybe we are supposed to let the Stu Stu for a few hours maybe we are meant to wait for the zucchini to grow into garden and maybe we aren't meant to have peach pie in January maybe maybe we are getting God's best if we lean into the patients that has food is inviting us into it is not possible I think it might be I think seasonal eating is so challenging to figure out how how can we figure out how to do that really well well there's good news is he's not eating for four most most of us who live in American shopping grocery store what what is available abundantly tends to be what's in season and available abundantly is cheaper so the good news is seasonal eating is also going to save you money yeah it does mean that we can't show up at whatever we get our our food with this list of but I must have this and we got to lean a little bit into the ingredients and lean a little bit into God's abundance and this this a little bit gets out what I talked a little bit in the tasting Grace about switching our posture from one of taking from the earth that one to one of receiving and when we are receiving the gift from God instead of taking it just changes shifts hour are thinking and it shifts our hearts into a place of gratitude and and I think that God's food system invites us into that and he's a little bit ignored it and sort of cloud 3 with are downloaded recipes of yeah but I want peach pie and today's the day I don't care if it's in season and that's that's taking instead of receiving and receiving is coming from a place of gratitude. From a place of entitlement so that's really beautiful that's a great thought that we were we get to receive when you're buying your groceries when you walk through are you kind of bait to the grocery store Shopper absolutely am talking about how the fact that most most of fresh ingredients are in the edge of the grocery store where is more processed is in processed foods to be clear my job is not to go out and Wagga finger in everyone's face and and she never went into a butterfly do you want potato chips in your Hamburger Helper go for it it's really a sense of considering how God is bringing us food and stepping into that rather than us just mindlessly plowing forth with our own agenda and Inno and living this food narrative that has I think me and heard so far away from what God intended food feels like it feels it feels like it to me and and and I mean that as a woman and I mean that as turn up child of someone on you know food assistance and as someone who works in the food business so I think I'm plugged into what you doing and I feel like we're pretty far from you from the good news is food what Freedom really looks like with food because I don't think freedom is saying you can't eat processed food you have to stay on the edge of the grocery store but Freedom also isn't eat whatever you want whenever you want it has to be more thoughtful than that what do you see as especially for people of Faith what does it look like to be free when you're eating I love that because does the word Freedom implies and I think rightfully so that there is such good news about food when we when we look at how God used food in the Bible the news is is all good I mean really is so there is freedom it's not we're not we're not the food police the good news about food with God is that it's not a story of Shame and guilt and so all of these societal messages that are out there if we choose to look past them and dig into what God intended food to be it's a really welcoming and Love Field Place you mentioned that it's not about us not being able to ever have processed food or it's not about shaming using process food because listen. Not everybody has easy access to fresh food and farmers markets and whatever the truth of the matter is that if you have to have a certain income level or living a certain part of this world or country to to eat a certain way than that by definition is food at leathem food elitism is not is not part of God story right. God isn't the source of Shane and process food when it started was to help us be a bite to eat things that might not last as long and I mean it was a it was a problem solver that we need food to last longer we need to de-seed more people and we also we were a weary tired Bunch yeah give us back a little bit of time will that is great with nobody can and I will have friends again so there's good as we tend to do in society we can take some of those good intentions and morph them into some half-truths and that we that we need to have that time back because we are going to do something valuable with it when most of us are actually using it for screen time yeah I'm at the truth of the matter is that if you're using screen time for more than 30 minutes a day you have that's what you've done with your time back from buying process hopefully I'm saying that somebody who does that too so just because things start out with good intentions doesn't mean that that's the way we're living with them now and we're not getting too far down that path of weed and what are we doing to our Earth and how are we how are you managing creation care what does that mean when we are trying to increase in production and and stripping out the nutrients of the soil and putting things so there's their ways of going about increasing yield that are more honoring to God's creation and rabidly more receiving than taking yes or receiving then taking and less profit-driven and less short-term thinking then long-term thinking so lots of issues come up when we sort of talked about this you know this this topic but how were eating and the context in which we are eating let's just say the potato chips for you know canned food or all of that matters right and and do I think it can be just as much of a blessing to open up a can of corn as it is to go out and do your backyard to the corn stalk you grew yourself absolutely absolutely God is so full of grace and beauty that we can receive and grow what you'd even the simplest craziest most processed I think so I think it really comes down to us being Discerning and mindful when we plow through our lives without stopping to think about how does God want us to receive Food and what does that mean across the entire food life cycle right from soil to note to the growing to the delivering to the recipes to the serving to the cooking to the cleaning up after people leave like that all of that what does that mean how do I behave across that food life size across that food life cycle I think we want to be mindful and aware and look to God too sore to say listen what what would not only please God but I'm hoping I'm being super clear about the message that how can we feel Our Best Buy getting God's best this is all good news for us because we're drawn into God's love drawn into God's best this isn't wagging finger you should do this because if not you're doing something wrong no it's just saying how we are invited into God's love and there's so much goodness and we're we're listening to messages that make us feel crummy and we don't have to feel crummy anymore that's what the messages that's the joy that's the gray satin tasting Grace is there so much goodness that can come from food food is a gift from God and we're missing out a little bit I think we're missing out and I think there's an invitation for us to draw in and and it's good news it's not shame news is it's good news girl passed the plates everybody we're going to eat together I love it and I'm really excited when I first got the first box of books that came to the house I opened it up and I was teary-eyed and I said to my husband this is the book that no one asked me to write and and the ones I got right because this this is the book that was in my heart that you thought I between you and me got I have to write it this was the book that I ended up finally just saying right it even if it's in perfect because every time I would hit turbulence on an airplane and I like to fly a great job everytime I hit turbulence in an airplane I will always think about my kids but I also like I started having the sense of I can't I can't be done because I need to write the book and and that's when I thought okay you know what I don't know it doesn't have to be perfect I even thought it doesn't even have to be good I just have to show up I just have to show up to God so this was the book that no one but God asked me to write so I'm so thankful exist I can't wait for next week leave on a tour come to the table where one of the things were talking about is what it look like to get everybody at the table and to feed them well and to just be in community like a good theme for what's going on right now we have to ask you one more question we already taken play your time thank you by the way for doing that. Thank you for having us has been like drinking from a fire hose as a person who loves food and wrestles with food and can hold both of those things at the same time tasting Grace has a real gift so thank you I am really really grateful as the show called that sounds fine unless I tell me what you do for fun this this one's easy I love going to the C that's that's the tricky part but different

I love I love the ballet too I love live performance yeah I grew up as a performer and there's nothing like stage and live performance because it is artistry in motion and watching the beauty of people with challenge being willing to go out there night after night and give you their all as I'm saying this I can feel that I'm getting teary-eyed I don't think I've ever seen a live show that hasn't brought me to tears even a small tears because the beauty of Art and people with with bringing in what did I say that what they give you fits it's so generous generous and to receive that generosity most guys lose my dad change my friend Gregory treco is in Hamilton and after I saw him I saw him as Aaron Burr he plays a couple drunk guys the first time I saw his Amber I was like I don't know how to tell you how generous that felt it was like you gave me everything Glenda I just cry it blows my mind and I feel like I'm in the presence of something wholly I really do and girl we could have a time in New York City you and I will go anytime anywhere I just was saying to my husband on my Instagram do they know that I consider myself really good Broadway Karma yeah I just have really good and I just was saying to my husband the other day that I realized I don't know but I have really good Broadway Karma as much as I will work every angle to go and see the shows that I want

work that just happens in food and Broadway in whatever we're doing I used to work in finance and there's holy work in that there's so much Beauty out there if we just look around at people who care a lot about the work they're doing and then they're doing it and that that's holy Girl yes is there anything we can talk about the on Sanibel it's like I just want to I want to see once I loved and I want to go back but then also like what's an object that we don't know I know I don't like to read up on the show so that I don't know what they're all about yes I will say parenthetically I I would I what I saw Hamilton twice for this very reason because I did not know it was about Hamilton but I would say that is one of the few shows I would say it's such a firehose of artistry that if you can read up on it a little bit before that frees you up to enjoy and receive a little bit better that is the only show that I would say I think you will enjoy it more if you've read up on it other than that I just want to show up again and I'm I am all yours I am all yours don't you dare open up a candy around me because I will give you the I like know I am there I am therefore it like what at yeah
