Jeff said he fled from the trip as soon as he was able golf course yeah yeah he had almost run into Hansen in the middle of the road outside of Roadhouse also all of this is on brand for Roadhouse it is when most people go home the drunk guy threw himself on the guys Hood what's going on here are you Michael Myers right in the middle of the road outside of Roadhouse and stopped to offer assistance I don't know I'm here for you. I mean you can window cracked you can be like you need any are you okay I'm going to call you in about this is me a person jumps out in front of my car scary person jumps out in front of my car to drive and hit reverse as fast as you know knock them over and cracked limit a little bit as you're driving over him and saying I'm calling an ambulance for you like as you're pulling away is better than being out like what do you need don't it's Jeff he told Jeff he needed a ride to Reedsburg but Jeff said he did not want to drive that far and offer Hanson a ride to a motel nice to St Joseph motel but they were unable to get a room there or at the motel across the street we got a real Mary and Joseph situation by this guy a random guy she is the friend of the bar on her we don't know that he isn't and also like is he getting a motel room to be with his guy what's happening it without us about the love for the motel is an ovulation test we were unable to get my run name of the person you pull up to the motel in all right buddy take it easy and have a little bit of to get a room that sounds so after they were unable to get a room just stated Hanson pulled a knife held it to his throat and demanded a ride to Reedsburg fearing for his life Jeff agreed to drive to Reedsburg I'll be like okay we're going to read in Hanson got back into the truck where he convinced Hansen to stop at a quick trip for cigarettes so that's Jeff me like you need cigarettes I said Jeff is like batting a thousand right now other than every choice he made leading up to this crisis Jeff is doing all the right things stop at QuikTrip for cigarettes they both went into the store so that was really got to come but Jeff fled as soon as he had the chance once around the block he called them and one I would have driven more than a barn over there if he pulled the knife on Jeff Hanson initially said no but then changed his story and said the man was hitting on him asked and wanted to have exchange money for sex that's also not night for the No No b******* but I do need a ride Greensburg even if they went to the hotel to the motel they were so it's not opposed now I need to take me to Reedsburg to see a woman lady no homo I got there's a lady waiting on me so no. You got to stop when you think about a read a read is like a long thin sure you can make noise like he's almost not putting that in the report that's a potato me to read blur he wanted a blood taken to reach out I'll of it is that you pull it off on them know and then it seems like okay yeah it's about stopping at motels Hampton and tonight they had stopped at motels once they did stop it you're just a liar until the tribes are going to get all this is what Miller Place Hampton under arrest which led Hansen becoming upset and stating he did not understand no more shall why am I the one getting arrested and claimed he was being placed this is my favorite excuse ever he was being placed under arrest for not performing oral sex on Jeff this is gay profiling he told officers they should have arrested Jeff for hitting on an extremely drunk man okay so maybe harass somebody but you can be drunk be like a I'm drunk are you drunk and drive this misdemeanor is supposed to be nerdcast why he continued trying to call Jay after he was left at the QuikTrip so he keeps trying to call chat number quote! Because he abandoned me yeah but he is hurt now break about love breakup love abandonment if there are no feelings there then you're not calling drive off into the night to return this phone number thanks. What's going on I was on board until the night came out pants and then changed his story again saying instead that he had asked Jeff to pull over at QuikTrip because he wanted to get out of the vehicle you didn't answer was transported to jail or he provided a preliminary breath test which registered at how much so just so you know and I'm sure you do but for Viva Latino sound 00 .08 is the legal limit right if you're above that you are now driving a d if you drive with no 8 108 point one is very drunk .22 is out of control .38 like vodka into the breathalyzer so if 33.0 it's 5:30 in the morning so it's been a while yes and no he's definitely not even he's going to go you can guess we have Takis first or in between the two of us which is the Tig Notaro slot TIG or third where would you like to guess Fortune I'll do the Tig Notaro still a go for just you saying that makes me maybe like a .09 I just wanted you to know I think he was a point 10.1 getting out on this I will tell you the answer to schedule for initial appearance August 21st so it's hard to know it hasn't yes it has happened if you want to go to Reedsburg and see the quote at the Juneau County Justice Center okay the amount of blood alcohol content the reading on the breathalyzer for Hanson the man who changed his story and not his heart is 0.18 more than twice the legal limit oh yeah I definitely 2 hours since you drank at the QuikTrip 0.18 is Alaska silver just ask Jon Dore show Walmart.

A man walked up to the counter 11 a.m. but that is like mid-morning he already had breakfast lunch time exactly you are up and put $5 high water they would wait for them to come and unlock the door cuz no one else is in there not to worry about anyting I said I will see that movie from under very good very good it was just after 11 a.m. on Monday that a man walked up to the counter at the u.s. bank branch at 7993 Euclid Avenue put it on the tour dumb people Town walking tour on the cities east side and passed a note demanding money I love it that's just still the way it goes and there's an Unwritten rule you got to write the note and finally want to create more evidence should never understood one type the letters like a ransom letter for real killing my magazine what's wrong why do people not just say it but I think that's why I didn't say it is not the greatest so that's the moment we're Dan become like whoever is if they're people is in the bike has to work at Banks Dave and say I'm sorry I can't hear you can you come outside and tell her I never got that movie you're right that is the move how about it like there weather planner bank statements nobody else slides a note to a bank teller Switz if someone slide your guy next person in line who's scrolling through his phone and has a survival games like like why aren't you depositing your checks just as Mobile Banking that's easiest thing to do when the teller took the note and looked at it and looked at the other side she saw his name he said he had used a note that he had used earlier at the BMV which I believe is the Bureau of Motor Vehicles of the Cleveland Office of the FBI has been wearing the bump it since the day it came out she's a goddamn FBI agent was fourteen red Batman Vicki Anderson is the kind of woman who wears a pant suit to a kid's birthday party has kick down her fair share of doors I think she's I don't know why am I picking you say as Michael Harrell was robbing the bank and he actually wrote the holdup no on the back of a document from the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles Michael name and address fine we're all he needed some paper he was like can you direct deposit the money I'm stealing into my account I wouldn't I where was I was stunned right now she actually even refer to him as Michael my guy right now Mike Michael Michael of freaked out when he when she realizes that that is that is so because you didn't conversation I mean I'm probably just felt comfortable. I forgot he was robbing a bank we take the time to get to know our Rob everyone with Robbie no we don't want to rob you of good customer service freedom is Michael quote gave him the money and called him Michael then notified lawn for she called the Michael at byui Double Michael I went a little too smoothly once authorities confirm that Harold was the same man caught on surveillance cameras robbing the bank a warrant was quickly quickly issued for his arrest the FBI said this is the first time that a bank robbers left something incriminating on a piece of evidence at the scene but in each case it makes the job finding the suspect a lot easier the door that they didn't intend to obviously we've had individual drop cell phones you all at yeah don't want to take anything identifying right near that everybody when I rub your neck or Grin While you're waiting in line to Rob and we've had individuals drop cell phones that have their identifying information in and we have individuals drop knowledge dropping hints Anderson said the quote a lot of times we're setting up pictures we have no idea who the person could be or what part of town they from and when you presented know that has your name already on it and address it helps law enforcement tremendo that's fine, however they are not willing to go so far as to say it's solved the case for us so we figured this out Vesta Gator said the smart move now for Harold would be to turn himself in he hasn't done and they haven't caught him yet anyone with information on Harold we're about call the Cleveland division of the police the FBI or the Cuyahoga Cuyahoga Cuyahoga County Crime Stoppers at 216-252-7479 and I'm right as he was leaving us a call or the fact that they know where he lives in Mexico right now what about wasn't is document we got him on a raw did he set out Michael Darrell Thomas and reward money is available we will get out of here on this how old is Michael Harrell so fortunate as they are Jessica first take her third how old do you think the man who tried to rob a bank and recently had to go down to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles with his information on the back 20 116 so I understand is
