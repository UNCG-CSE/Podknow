Louis for how is the way you were raised how does that affect your philosophy of food and restaurants from here to Charlotte and I love stuff that you put in a glass to of almost every stripe and growing up in St Louis honestly it during my Eero the food was okay but it was really the way the restaurants made you feel that made me love going out to restaurants I love the fact that this restaurant when I was a kid I was a nobody it's like seat that kid under the Cuckoo-Clock cuz he's always happy they're right in this other restaurant always remember my dad's favorite dish in my mom's birthday and that stuff really stuck with me and then when I moved to New York when I was in my early twenties the food was amazing in New York but they treated you really poorly it was kind of like this year right after the Red Velvet Rope nightclub area where the most popular rest answer the ones that treated you the worst and I didn't understand that and I kind of just said why not bring what I love from growing up back home whoever wrote The Great Food isn't going to taste better just cuz you're being treated nicely what was the first breakthrough for you started 27 years old she started kind of with this philosophy I know that I read somewhere you said people wearing a t-shirt that says show me how to import and I'm paraphrasing but tell me about philosophy and how it went into your first restaurant before it be expanded well well before I got into the restaurant business when I was 20 my dad's to wear my dad had a travel business where he was selling group tours throughout Europe and my brother sister and I when we each turn 20 got to pick a country I picked Rome which is the country and I was the guy that would go pick up a cranky group of Americans at the Rome airport at 8 in the morning the head and slept all night put them on the bus get on the microphone and say you're not allowed to drink this water be careful about not getting your pocket picked at cetera and I have this crazy reason that I was going to take the crankiest person on day one and turn them into the happiest person by day 5 love it and the more I did that I kept I kept getting tips and and I kind of liked it I kind of like taking something that made me feel good that made other people feel good and making money from it. How did you do that how did you take the person with most everyone truly is walking around with this sign this invisible sign around their neck that says make me feel important and put the thing is it's invisible so you can't see quite have we lit it is you can't see the font size but the biggest thing I've learned I've learned how to do was to read the subtitle cuz every one of those signs has a subtitle that starts with the word by so make me feel important by leaving me the hell alone make me feel important by letting me tell you everything I know let make me feel important by just listening to me and I feel like that it's an amazing gift in business to be able to understand that that you know we got this expression the Golden Rule I used to think that that's that's what I did do unto others as you would have others do unto you but I think in all these years I've learned that there is a golden rule of hospitality which is do unto others as you believe they would want done unto them and you've got to be able to read their sign because not everybody wants it the same way I would remind me to talk with the gentleman who started MTV in one point he took of her Six Flags Magic Mountain and you told me that you did this Mitchell lecture we told everybody like companies that we're going to compete with Disney and be like we're not going to compete with Disney this guy's insane and he said that Disney has a rule within you get within five feet you must make eye contact with you and the three feet you say one of these three or four things you must beat the Wylie cuz I want you to treat people like their family they said one day he was out and this woman had a young child for 5 years old he took his ice cream and slammed the concrete everywhere splattered everywhere and the general came over and started screaming at the kid and the mother and he immediately stepped in separate them out to be my family so that's what I would do with him so your points well-taken it's not how we want to be treated as hell they want to be treated you know you have this term that call enlightened Hospitality it's really kind of a record of what you do with fine casual dining I think it's the language I read that you utilize tell us a little bit about what is that what is enlightened hospitality and how do you really deliver it when you scale yeah that's when we when you're doing well me that's that's probably the biggest challenge that makes me excited to come to work every single day for his Hospitality Hospitality it's not just what you get for Thanksgiving or you know whatever Holiday from your from your grandmother how many of you out here are in the hospitality business raise your hand I totally disagree everyone you should be raising your hand to her right now every single one of us is in the hospitality business because there's this thing we do but and only get you to the 49-yard line whatever your card says you do get you to the 49er line you want to get all you want to get all hundred yards the 51 extra yards come from how you make people feel while you're doing that incredible thing you do that's hospitality and I think that we are all so focused on performance which is great I don't want to I don't want to tell you performance isn't crucial if you don't perform beautifully you just know where you're not even at the Starting Gate but there are so many come please the can now do what you do is because it's the word gets out they can copy it how did you make all of your stakeholders feel now who are your stakeholders and this is what enlightened Hospitality means every single one of us has the exact same five stakeholders but each one of us also gets to pick in which order are we going to prioritize them and all my life growing up for my family in St Louis I heard customer's always right customers always first and that they've got me kind of far then I took a class of I took one economics class in college and we are studying the sky Milton Friedman from the University of Chicago who said nope the investor is always first because if you make every decision on behalf of the investor everything works out and I'm just completely conflicted in my brain because what I realize we were doing and I sat down to write setting the table I said we screw this up we actually put the customer second we put of all the five stakeholders we put our team first or customers second our community third our suppliers forth in our investors 5th and we did that not because we didn't want to have really happy customers and not cuz we didn't want to make our investors a lot of money we actually are selfish and we think that if you start a virtuous cycle where one good thing keeps leaving at something even better not put your investors first because that'll be the smallest thing at that point and what we are guests in Oliver restaurants are never any happier coming to dine with us then our staff members are going to work and so that's where it had to start so this is what we do right now in in something that I just devoting my career to is this whether or not you eat at McDonald's I think you would have to acknowledge that there's probably never been a food business that has better scale systems for how to do the thing you do you can get a French box of french fries anywhere in the world and it's going to taste the same and I think that's that's been a remarkable achievement of its own and I think the thing that I want to devote our purpose is can you scale a feeling can you scale Hospitality can you make it so that wall that burger or that rack of barbecued ribs or whatever their black truffle in the chicken whatever it is you're eating that has to chase consistently good but how can you now say and while you're eating it you're going to feel treated consistently will and that's the thing that I'm devoted to tell me about two things if you would one is I know you have a hiring philosophy where you I think you called to 51% if I'm not confusing it where you're putting those human skills first that intellectual emotional Fitness and psychological Fitness ahead how do you pick those people how do you know and then secondly how do you nurture your employees so that that scale actually occurs is one thing to have the intention but when you have what now 900 how many employees do you have to check that out before Shake Shack Shake Shack's probably got over 4,000 and that's the key thing and then you're asking the right question because you get feeling from people you don't get feeling from things and so we were able to identify six emotional skills that are always present at a very very high level and someone who's got what we call having a high HQ people who are going to really fulfill that last 51% for years and a high HQ Hospitality quotient if you got an HQ HQ you're probably somebody who is happier yourself when you make someone else feel better know you guys like to hug around here right hugging is probably the biggest expression of hospitality the only way to get a hug is to give one first unless you're dealing with a tree or something it doesn't work that way so we have found that the kind of the six emotional skills that are always present at a high level are kindness and optimism that's enough that's I get a twofer on that one Skeptics and cynics don't tend to really care that much about how they make people feel number to intellectual Curiosities numbers 3 work ethic number for empathy that shouldn't come as a surprise number 5 self-awareness knowing what your own personal weather report is on any given day is hospitality is a team sport and you will infect your team one way or the other and I bet you can guess the 6-1 Integrity having the judgment to do the right thing even when it may not be in your own self-interest so we going to all of those in-depth I don't know how to teach any of them I don't I don't know how to talk to you to be kind if you're not kind agree but what we can do is we can teach people on our team how to interview for those emotional skills and we can also teach our leaders how to celebrate those emotions heels how many of you have had a job were the thing you got bonus on was something that could be measured cost control higher sales whatever how many of you have ever had a job where you got bonus for how you made people feel we need to see a whole lot more hands go up if this country is going to lead the continue to lead the way in this Hospitality economy are there are you watching people Southwest Airlines there was a point when they had the worst ratio of approval for the stewardesses in storage and I talked with the gentleman who turned that around in the way he did it was it wasn't by the interview they did group interviews entering the group interview the person to come on stage and have to say why they should be selected above everyone else but what they didn't realize they weren't judging the speaker they were judging the listeners because Southwest help people with sit-down barely take care of you and locked himself up if you wanted some how to undo their belt to get all pissed off and then went to the people they're cheering for the person they're competing with how do you find these qualities is it behavioral that you're noticing is it something you're seeing by talking to people and passwords that things are just show up during the interview itself or all the above I'm curious well they definitely don't tend to show up on a two dimensional piece of paper also known as an application this so the interview is absolutely the first q u i wouldn't say to you hey Tony tell me about your work ethic I've got a great one but I'm going to be able to tell based on the way you present yourself did you did you do any research on the company what kind of questions are you asking at cetera but to your point about Southwest Airline every two weeks to this day I conduct a meeting with anyone in our company who has been hired within the past two weeks and what I'm doing is while people think I'm putting it out there to them I'm really really taking it in and I promise you in every single session we called new hire orientation let's say there's 20 or 30 people in the room there's always two people in the room who either I put to sleep or they put themselves to sleep cuz it's tough just isn't jazzing them and so what I tell them using a funnily enough in an airplane metaphor is this a you ever been on it playing in the first thing that the flight attendant says is you know if Palm Beach wasn't your destination now would be a good time to get off the airplane that's what I say to people and I say look I told you where we're going that's my job is the boss but you're the passenger your life is so much more important to you than this company and this would be a good time to get off the airplane Jazz you and then I actually invite people I said if you're feeling that way I have no sympathy for you if when you wake up tomorrow morning you look yourself in the mirror that you're just doing time because you do not need this job there are many other jobs you could have out there to process a little different but similar approach any actually offers the money to leave it's I think it's three weeks if I remember right when I try to do it on the cheap tell me how do you create that okay that you're selecting well I guess that's a no report for Dodge Journey the root beer its way people are found and then train not just train so I think we're winding that but how do you keep that culture alive when it's scaling so large like what do you do for the employees to make them feel like their first before before there's anything we do for the employees it's what can they do for each other and we tell every single person who works on our team that your highest priority is how you treat each other you yourself need to be the single highest reason that all of the rest of your colleagues want to come to work and you know if hospitality is a team sport why is it that the baseball players leave leave home and they don't go hey honey I'm going to work I'm going to play You're going to win and I want I want a team of people that are most excited to go beyond that team because someone or some other people on the team let's face it you've got one of the greatest tribes in the world out here which I'm incredibly impressed with of all of the tribes in our lives with her is your tribe or whether it's your family work is pretty high up there where you go to work as one of your tribes and that's it the biggest thing that any tribe has is a Common Language and I think that words are the most powerful mortar between the bricks of any culture whatsoever so in addition to saying it's you it's not his job to make you happy I can't you know I've got to work on myself all the time what I can do is provide a platform where I think you can do your best work and I can do that by making sure that on this team we're always going to draft the most talented players on the field who are also the most fun people to sit in the Dugout with and just one quick thing think about baseball for a minute think about a sport where every single thing as measured there's percentages for throwing and fielding and then hitting and who did how did you hit against a left hand right hand why don't we have any statistics for who are you on the in The Dugout half of a nine-inning game is spent sitting with your team and you are actually actively motivating everybody even when you're not on the field and that's something that I really think this 51% is about how do you inspect that how do you support that organizationally you just have strong enough liters each location do you personally inspected us our team that goes through everybody's held accountable for for family values and I think all of us grew up with family values we all grew up with a family culture I always kind of laugh when I hear someone say we got to work on having a culture around here you have a culture whether you work at it or not a question is is it intentional and is it uplifting so a culture is just a fancy word for how we do things around here and so are the way that with the way that we really really watch we actually Pulsar staff from time to time and give them the opportunity to say how does it feel to work here right now and we listen and sometime you cure the same themes that you've been hearing for 15 years that's on me when that happens sometimes you will find that one restaurant is in a really really good morale swing and another one is it's kind of flattering a little bit in the same way that we take the temperature every single day and we look at the temperature tomorrow to see what we're going to wear you got to do that with how things are feeling around your business as well how do you intervene when it's not where you wanted to be I think you hold people accountable to the family values know what is a family value in what is a culture none of it is a way to tame the ocean of its waves the waves are going to keep coming but when you have a mirror so for example are family values or Excellence doing the thing you do as well as you can possibly do it and figuring out how to do it even better tomorrow honoring the work you did yesterday cuz you're a human being number to hospitality there was a big surprise doing the thing you do in a way that makes other people feel better third entrepreneurial Spirit coming up with a fresh way of looking at at processes that the rest of us only wish we had thought of Hurst everything can get better and I cannot be a top-down idea generator it's got to come from from the people on the front lines and then fourth Integrity having the judgment to do the right thing even when it's not in your own self-interest even when no one else is looking so that's our mirror and if something doesn't feel right about someone's Behavior it's almost inevitable that we're going to be able to say you know that thing about Excellence you made a commitment that in honoring your work yesterday flawed though it maybe you were going to figure out a way to do it even better today consistently you've not been doing that and then the other thing Tony is we make a chart and it's the it's the can can't wheel won't charge and you can just make a little graph and you start on the left with can and then all the way to the right Hugo Kant start at the top of Will and you got to the bottom and you don't want and now you've got can and will can and can't will and won't and I can't remember the other one right now you guys can draw this now but every single one of those quadrants applies to my behavior at it on a given date and if it's if it's a willing can then our job to reinforce that behavior is to celebrate it always if the answer is can but won't right we got an attitude issue right there but not a capability issue then my job is to inspire and I'm going to be I'm not going to have a Long Leash on someone who can but they wants to many organizations put up with culture to feeding behavior is because the guys so good at what what he or she does that doesn't work if it doesn't work so hard to make sure I get the right nature to start with and if you're wrong and the Kraken doesn't work and make changes it sounds like rapidly always have to in any other reason that I called my book setting the table is that when I first shopping Union Square Cafe for whatever silly reason I decided that the salt shaker should sit right in the center of the table and the fact is life always is moving that salt shaker around and I just have to we have something we talked on some gentle pressure you just got to constantly push that salt shaker back to the center you don't get angry at it you don't get angry at life you don't get angry at people who moved it you just push it right back and I just don't think that there's a greater center of the table and culture cuz it gets off and you're in trouble. It's cuz it's going to be part of the process anytime you build something interview begins but you you move it you don't get upset about if you keep it back in the side of the table what we've been saying I was going to say I heard this great quote from the athletic director at UCLA and they've got a Hall of Fame anyone from UCLA course you are so you guys have an athletic Hall of Fame at UCLA cuz you've won more championships than any other university in every kind of sport and these someone asked the athletic director so what are you a tribute to guess what he said culture and he said culture is is just like a baby you got to watch it 24/7 you got to change it no you got to feed it at least 7 times a day and one of them makes and when it makes a mess you better clean it up immediately thought that was great. That's awesome really good I was I was reading the book culture code Daniel Coyle from the right and you were written up in there they talked about your vulnerabilities when the principles they're that you acknowledge when it's not working immediately bet it's no bull that it's truth but you also don't tolerate keep me in that way about your leadership while so you kind of are by telling us about your culture but when is what makes a great leader in any of your organizations and how you how do you inspire those qualities our final quality I think I think a great leader first and foremost has two Express what success looks like where are we going and what does success look like and how are you supposed to behave while you're getting there inconsistently Shine Your Light I kind of I kind of look at it like the Statue of Liberty with the with the beacon and anytime you do something really well according to what we agreed you're going to do I'm going to shine the light on you anytime anything good happens for a company I'm going to shine the light on you any time you screw up I need to shine it on both of us and any time I screw up it's going to be squarely in my face and I think leaders who do that make it safe to make mistakes I will put up with any mistake that does not lack Integrity cuz I think that's where some of our greatest learning Comes Around by the way Brothers one is the way to shine the light on you but another way to do it is you got to have fire in the belly do you guys think you understand that here I think you understand what's going on here and sometimes leaders can what you have right here is a bonfire and that's where we all have something in common you got to look for those common celebrations but sometimes there's even time for a campfire and what a campfire is there's only four or five of us there's not four thousand of us a leader sometimes needs to take three or four people and have a campfire where you get a little bit more intimate what the leaders doing at that point I was taking a fire out of your belly trusting that by putting it here where we don't have a power differential it can bring us all together if you do that too often though other people on the team are going to get jealous that they were not invited with are marshmallows and when you're sleeping in the tent they could put out your fire so you got to use that campfire before sometimes you use your fire to warm somebody who needs it and sometimes you got to use your campfire to send somebody because they betrayed your principles and I would say that how long do you tolerate a betrayal of principles if I have one part of my own leadership that I would criticize the most and like everybody else to take your greatest strength too far and it becomes a weakness is my patience is probably not the wick on my candle is sometimes a little bit too long and that's why I created that will won't can camp because I wanted to give myself in order to measure a better sense of what we agreed the time frame will be for somebody who's either can't do it or List It and I've got a great HQ but you're not a great right fielder I'll try them at third base you just you just never know if they have that psychology and emotion there you just heard any talk about what makes a great leader and his own leadership style but leadership isn't a position that some achieve While others don't it's a skill that can be mastered if you want to discover your level of leadership and what you need to work on to make the most positive impact in your business and your life go to www.tonyrobbins.com leader let's take you back to the interview Tony you know Shake Shack you took some time in fact one of your books on your books I read somewhere you said Slow Down with the secret to success and he was 10 years if I remember right after your first restaurant before you open a Shake Shack in the past 5 years if I remember correctly that right before you open another Shake Shack that's what you mean by go slow to succeed and why did you take so long in these situations well there's there's really two reasons I do believe that one of the things were all confronting right now is that everything is moving so fast we all multitask for all but going from app to app and phone call to phone call that I don't I think we've lost some of the art of growing where you're planted and I think when you grow where you're planted you get to set your roots and when you set your roots you get more nutrients and I think the fruit taste a whole lot better grapevines know that and so that was one reason I really do you know Shake Shack was an accident it was never meant to be a big public company before that because it's must realize it started in the park as I understand it as I'd like a hot dog cart we did that because an artist we brought an artist to Madison Square Park to beautify the park and make it safe to come there and this artist from Thailand said you know along with my for taxi cabs on stilts I want there to be a working hot dog cart and we so we'll be glad to do what I wanted to test out the theory of hospitality could you was Hospitality just for fancy restaurants or could you do it with a hot dog cart so we pick Chicago-style hot how much does a got eight toppings and I wanted to see if our team could say oh that's the guy that likes everything except neon relish nobody should like neon relish that's the person who likes everything except pickles and mustard and we have a hundred people waiting in the line wow and so we we did it 9/11 happen the city was obviously depressed and in 2002 the second summer the art was Gone with the community said please bring back a hot dog cart it did the same thing in 2003 by 2004 we said what about creating this as a permanent kiosk so we gifted this kiosk to Madison Square Park philanthropic Lee we said will own the business you be the landlord and if this thing works will bring people to the park to keep it safe the rent will go back into the park and wouldn't you know it this little thing called Shake Shack lines and lines and lines of people this day which is now 15 years old this year Madison Square Park we got a public company out of it Madison Square Park gets just about 1 million dollars in rent just from that one Shack so that's incredible that I have a credible so because I'd say the second reason that really really took my time is it growing up in St Louis my dad who is a really really gifted entrepreneur unfortunately didn't do a great job of surrounding himself with really talented people and every time he grew without a foundation of town of people something bad happened and I watched him go bankrupt twice and I don't know if anyone's ever had that experience of sitting in the living room watching your dad who's your hero start to cry in front of the whole family and putting all that you know Is that real vulnerability here's your here's that you know your hero in life and I just said I never going to let that happen and unfortunately it wasn't until he died at the age of 59 from cancer that I actually allowed myself to believe that you can expand without going out of business or we just have to do it a different way but going slow served with that stayed tell people look in the story so you start with Shake Shack in the park now it's a public company how many facilities do you want your revenues and and how what do you what is the real separation Shake Shack from so many other fast food places you've kind of Amplified a little bit about Hospitality but what do you think that specific about your restaurants why is that taking off to the level of house is going to Shake Shack open its first Shack in Baton sanghai the line of people was 1,000 people long to get in and that's exactly what happened in Seoul Korea exactly what happened in Tokyo that's exactly what happened believe it or not in Saudi Arabia and it's it's a it's a good question Tony because obviously we did not invent Burgers and Shakes and Fries we won't be the last people doing it really proves to me that if you take something that people already know and you you cook it better than they knew it could be and you treat them better than they knew they could be treated and you create a mission so that the people who come to work there truly understand why they're coming to work and they're rooting for each other and when Shake Shack went public 100% of all the employees many of them had never had a job before Shake Shack were given the opportunity to buy the stock at the strike price which is at that time was $21 and then every manager was given stock options and unlike the rest as they were not locked up and I can't tell you how gratifying it is when you can meet someone and they say you know my college loans I was intending to be paying that for eight years it's done you know I never thought I could put my kid in college now I can so awesome this really beautiful I saw you kind of look at yourself out the language I read some words that you look at yourself and kind of the executive producer of these restaurants tell us what that means I you do your homework what that means is there sending you know is each one of us as we grow our business has to understand that the license to grow is Letting Go it's truly finding people at every step of the way as you grow You Are by definition even you you're taking on things you've never done before your company was not this big a year ago as it is today. So by definition it's a different set of challenges for you and so each time we grow my license to get there is to make sure to go over my lawn manicure my lawn that's what I call it and what that means is look take inventory of every single thing that I do all day and ask myself of all the things I do today what are those things that someone else could do at least as well or better than I could have got to give him a chance to do that and then constantly say and what are those things that only I can do in that way and the good news is that that list is getting smaller and smaller and smaller and that's why unlike my first restaurant when I was 27 where I was the screenwriter in the stage director and the best actor in The Director now I'm the executive producer and what that means to me is I'm responsible for picking the things we do and dumped you I'm responsible for picking the key Talent right I'm not going to give up picking the chefs of our restaurant in the general managers of the restaurant in The Architects and obviously the concepts of our restaurant and sometimes even the art on the walls but I got it I got to stand back and I've got to let other people growing for me that's the fun of of what I do right now but we talked about the first day here because most people become the artist they become the not that they become the operator they're not the owner and he just gave you a beautiful set of steps I hope you heard that was simple questions you can ask so that you can begin to scale more impact by seeing who can you replace yourself with really simple really elegant Danny what's up what would you want to tell if you want to come to work we just getting in any business let me see your hospitality what were the two or three things that you think are most important for any business to succeed I think I think you got to love the topic I think I think what all entrepreneurs have in common is that there's this idea that solves a problem for people and it makes them feel so happy that they just cannot wait to share that with other people you just have to and you cannot see failure as a possibility as matter fact I believe all entrepreneurs are excited right we only see up we don't see down we don't know what could go wrong as matter fact it's a going to be a key skill set to surround yourself with somebody who could see what could go wrong without being your editor while you're dreaming your great dream that's a really really important thing I also think it's critically important now that you've got this topic that you loved it's going to solve other people's problem is that you say nothing makes me happier than watching what my product does four people I'm the weird guy if you were ever go to Citi Field or the Mets play where we've got four different ways you can eat there all at Centerfield where no one ever used to go now people come to Citi Field early just for the purpose of eating I'm the weird guy wearing the hat in the glass is lurking around watching people eating our food and I'm just I just love how happy it makes him just makes me feel great and then the third thing I'd say besides you should take pleasure in what your product does for other people is you just got a you just got to be willing to work because we're in a day and age where the second you do have a good idea the whole world knows that someone's going to Tweet about it Instagram it not what I was going to say is you just there's no substitute for hard work and execution you guys have been saying that for the entire 5 days here but the minute the word gets out that you're so good at what you do someone will copy you everyone in the world is not walking around with their own pocket plagiarizer takes pictures of things within two seconds if I if I tasted great dish somewhere it's going to be on my chefs desk in two seconds if I see a great flower display it's going to be on the florist desk in 2 seconds right so I got to I got to keep working and I've got to keep getting us first 49 yards lace and tell me you cannot win with A51 Point Hospitality win but you can't win with 49 either and so we're constantly trying to win on both of those fronts and if you keep it such as working it's the way you work as you're constantly innovating so it is not doing the same thing over and over again cuz somebody's coming in their cropping you let you know when I get to where you are to be where you were if you keep referring you know that's really when you make Zach Lee what'll happen so we cannot stop innovating but we have to realize that the shelf life of innovation has gone from three years do about 3 minutes you're so true the Tony Robbins podcast is a collection of interviews and stories and is produced by the Tony Robbins team copyright Robbins research international
