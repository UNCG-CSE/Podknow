and let's go impromptu editions funny they loves that it's loves you to listen to him and be involved in his head lice when it out there as if he likes affection not sure what's tell a soul about this

struggle feeling that kind of stuff recently in and just to just be on terms and if my brother to call him on his birthday and let him know that I care about him you know what I want how I just saw I hope he knows you know how much I love him know what am I how much are how much of an inspiration is to me I think it's it's funny sometimes I don't know if people know that can really tell what they mean to others you know it's like some of the people will just see them people be able to tell like you can never really fully kind of Express to somebody how they affect you sometimes maybe you can maybe I just haven't tried that much you know maybe I haven't maybe a half you know I don't know just kind of spitballing here but I'm just happy I'm happy that my brother was born even though we weren't close for a long time I'm happy that you know I got a surprise as I've gotten older and and and that's been the gift of of his in a pretty unconditional love really and he loves his kids and does he loves to just care he beat you I don't know he's just he is he's a deep dude man that dude is bro I think they should have a diving board right next to him I wouldn't be surprising my brother rolled around had a diving board next to him because that dude is a deep is a deep dude and he loves he loves to know what makes people think and feel and and he's just really really fascinated by that kind of stuff and and it brushes off into me and it's there when I need it and he's such a great reference and you know a lot of times he's only he he's almost like a father to me too and some ways you know it's interesting how we get different pieces of what we need from different places or I do you know I get different you know what sometimes I think I don't you know one of the reason may be why I'm not making like successful relationships or some of that kind of thing is because I I want to get the attention that I need I want to get it from I want to get it how I want it I want to get it it's almost like maybe I'll I like okay I'll get i'll get this from here in this from this person in this from this person not on the selfish way but just this is where I will let these things up hit me and you know I'll let this person care about me in that will suffice for this feeling that I need and I'll let just just because it's more in control you know it's almost like I get it you know I get it's almost like I want to I want to control where I let affection into my life so that and it's such a tricky path that I'll let it in through that it's but at least that way I know that I'm the most protected you know I'm the most safe for myself anyway I didn't mean to get off on a on that you know when the dam on the damn you know whatever you know I didn't mean today you know poor

about the fight so people saw the fight I'm not upset I mean I'm man I dated I was just god dude I wanted I even that nobody can beat that man khabib it's not he's not it's like fighting a lava it's like fighting like it's almost like khabib is like one of those blankets you see on the internet where it's like oh you need this heavy this heavy blanket so you can't sleep here here this heavy blanket for $140 you can get this 30 pound blanket in a blanket that is a trap that is a trap dude somebody right now people like oh yeah they've been they got the new blanket and they've been asleep for a month you have the babies been resting for 2 weeks the baby can't get out the bed cuz he's under a dang 30 pound blanket and that's it I just felt like I don't know man let's let's take a couple of calls about it some people came in and you guys know they were cheering for Dustin the Diamond Poirier and he's that Rare Element I mean he should be on the periodic table and and I think one day he may be let's get into a couple of calls that came in on the hotline as always the hotline is 985-664-9503 from Garvey man I tell you this we got so many calls Express and just people sharing their moods during the fight and what was going on what my thoughts I mean the fight itself I thought you look first of all I don't know anything about fighting okay I'm not going to pretend like I do I don't know you know I think Dustin is a very neat person and I think he's very dynamic as a human and so I want to see him do well at whatever he's doing you know like my investment personally is in him as a human he happens to be a fighter use any any great fighter I just think you know like khabib or khabib or however is he's like kind of like to me it's not fight it would be neat if they had to be on their feet for half the rent and they could then the rest is only a certain amount of time they can be on the ground now I'm not been in and I told Brendan Schaub that and he goes well that's not the sport and that you may be right but for me is of you or I'd like to see a little bit cuz I want to see both of them be able to do some of the stuff that I really you know that I like to watch him do I like to I like to see the action on a different levels so you know that's your kind of bummed me out because khabib is fucking boring the shit is boring they was like watching somebody lose their house to some lava text you know 19 minutes or whatever his fucking born so yeah we go watch Lava do get on the internet they got a bunch of lava flows did I used to watch flow then you can you can be on a 3-hour YouTube of a flow bro and it finally fucking kills a sapling outside of Kauai you're like us shit man it was three hours of my life thankfully I had a little bit of cocaine you feel me born how to make a lava speed up a little bit but that it was like yeah it was like watching some I mean it just I don't know and no disrespect the guys graded at what he does just to me it's fucking boring to me it's boring you know I'm a dude you know I watch what I watch and then I like to consume things how I liked him to meet us it was boring and I just you know I thought I was just born man I mean I was really bummed out and there's people you know what the bar yelling Shannon and then I watched it with Nick and Jionni you know the premature in the twink man that you know more cruelly watch it together as a team and and we were I mean the first the venue look like a like a damn no air conditioning your like where are these guys in a tent out back and I'm not saying that they just when I was watching the on the on the Fight Pass they got this accoutrement you can buy and you get that you know special deal on the internet and you can watch it and it looked like they were in a damn FEMA 10th or something out back so but hey you supposed to be you know they can fight wherever it just that the the live stream or whatever they had was going was it was a lot of it was very boring the atmosphere seemed kind of mild and what else but yeah I mean I was definitely bummed I was bummed for I was born for him you know I wanted him to be able to win I know how much he really wanted to win that was very evident when you watch his you know his interviews afterwards and stuff and and let's get a little bit we got this call and I'll share a little bit more of my thoughts are we got this call that came in a perspective from the arena here we go. Thank you for calling man and and and thank you guys for hosting that event it seems like an even Dustin said it was just an amazing event and if you watch on on Dustin story on his Instagram story they have the dude eating gold meat and they're doing all kind of crazy stuff over there so really seeing his experience over there is is pretty cool just to see a guy from just a small place in Louisiana to get to go in that Adventure that that's a small victory right there let's hear more Ali and give you some perspective on how things went inside the arena last night since you weren't able to make it so that was hot in there that's the first thing and there was about a hundred thousand wow and do deposit to Russians at a gas station I'm I'm driving off usually because those guys do Dill drink do Dill sit there. Don't have no be mixing used diesel as a mixer so you'll see a guy with a orange juice and you know and 96 Patrick you know they're dieseling up you'll see a guy at the Exxon fucking mcmakin up a picture of mixed drinks those are some there's some tough guys what's your more was definitely some hostile territory and the lamp up all night every fight seemed like I had a Russian guy in it with different sizes even one guys like 300 pounds on that kind of thing yeah I feel like they kept taking one guy in the back and then pulling are you know stuff in Fannin we're pulling around them or putting muscle in a more just like they were back there Frankenstein you know they got a table they got 19 things they got a beard sideburns no beard you no more fat more muscle to hear some my sternum boom boom boom send them back out same guy more worried about three more fights just in our section so the crazy environment and obviously didn't get the results you wanted but I just started you don't give you a perspective from in there he definitely didn't win the fight but you definitely want a lot of people over and you got a lot of respect from the people in the cloud and I think people all over the world now know who he is I wouldn't stand for and that's something that you can take with him for the rest of his life you know the monkey championship belts come and go but that was stuff he has and to your kind of put in Louisiana on the map to he can hold his head I forgot so anyway thank you I really appreciate that you know I love that on the ground that just that lie you know thank you bro that's really kind of you to share what that experience was like from there and I wrote you know nnnnn just the fact that you're right he can hold his head up high that's something that yeah like I was bummed that you know I was definitely upset that it that he came in second place I don't see how anybody beats khabib is kind of like when Michael Jordan played you just but still it just because you didn't beat Michael Jordan doesn't mean you're not Dominique Wilkins you know I mean Dustin is still be to ever he's if it's anybody else if it's any other time existence in the universe you know he's a big he got half the belt you know he got the Bell when it wasn't available to meet he was he's he's the Pinnacle there's just there's this other Pinnacle that's floating off in the distance that that's its own it's on its own frequency and that is and that's khabib but I ah yeah I think something about Dustin is I feel like either he probably don't even realize and he made man this is probably aren't from being judgmental here or or hopeful I feel like it over his tenure is run you know it's specially in the past year that through through fighting in through UFC he has shown who he is as a person and a lot a lot of people even if they have a great vehicle in their life that allows them to achieve dreams or goals aspirations rarely does also who they are or which is the bigger victory of them being just a just do you know a good person all of them fighting the good fight when that's what his foundation's call but yeah fighting the good fight I think a lot of people realize oh I'm a fan of this guy because of who he is yes he's a fighter but but he's I think he's like a hero to a lot of people and I know it's a kind of a wild word but yeah I mean I guess he's he's definitely an inspiration and so I think yeah it's like I just hope that he sees I think that he kind of transcended the sport a little bit in the scent that he has gotten that people see him as a as a communicator and as a interpreter for good in the world and that you know what I don't know I just you know some of those few athletes get to do that few people in their in their genres of of of entertainment or a competition get to do that we also see their heart you see who they are and then that becomes like I could see Dustin being a mayor or Governor even like I think he just has this you know he has this Relentless drive that is going to bring him success in anything he does but I just got here. You know I don't know here I am pining like fuck dude that sound like I don't even know you know I just think he's in the he's such an inspiration to a lot of people in yeah he'll have the he had the Bell do you have the belt again over here he might get different belts but I think he's in this bigger competition I think we're people see how that guy you know a lot of fighter they come and go but this guy can stay forever if he wants to as a leader of people and and I just hope he see that I hope he sees book I hope you I hope he sees what we can all see that he's in this bigger competition of inspiring people that kind of kind of like a competing on a higher level of a human level that I think that we all want to be in the ring you know why we all want to be in that ring, that makes sense but anyhow man but thanks for that man that's really nice of you to send in that perspective and just to have us to get an idea of what it was like in there I can't imagine being in there but I thought it was great man I was fun to watch him get out there and perform it was fun to watch him to me at all seem like a performance to but it was very fun to see the excitement in there and people just you know all the crazy beards and everybody looking like they got pubic hair on them everybody's cheeks look like a set of nuts up in there and they got a damn you know everybody's wrapped up in the turban what were the concessions like that's what I like I would love to know that would be concessions were like in there like at the concession stand like do they have a Pepsi do they have a dynamite what do you know what are they what's for sale I want to let you know this it's a new season Antonio Brown is on the well he's on the Patriots now can you believe that makes you hate him and respect him at the same time Le'Veon Bell is with the Jets Odell Beckham is in Cleveland the season has started there's so many new great players Mahomes blew it up the one thing that hasn't changed is where I'm putting my money down and all the games mybookie is the place to bet on football every weekend mybookie has better bonuses and more prop bets than any other sports book.

a flammable email that's what I told her and she goes okay but I'll let you know more brother on board missing out about me this expand on the thing that you said that older people were more physically active oh you were talking about this last week about maybe why I get stuck in my brain sometimes is because my body is more more sedentary more sedate more calm also course not brain of

called once upon a time in Hollywood and I left an hour and 40 minutes and I left out right now in 650 60 Minutes think maybe an hour and 65 minutes Anderson I left out and I didn't think it would it would just as there was another wasn't enough story for me there wasn't enough and maybe something's wrong with me but I didn't like it I thought it was a waste of time I thought it was a waste of it was to you know ambidextrous I thought that too many hands in the pudding so you know one thing I thought was interesting in it watching Brad Pitt walk usually don't see him walk in awhile since I held that damn door for my few years ago actually are they don't Fox lot watching him walk ins you see his giddyup he's got a little kind of a hitch in his giddy up and I thought that that was just interesting to see that man walk around he looks a little older than I remember him looking at that made me a little sad kind of because we're all you know we're falling apart dude that's why maybe everybody maybe bread need to get some fake tits you feel me and I'm saying if you want to be right get right and and what else did I like about it is character was okay it just died at some point I was definitely locked in and then some point it was I don't know cuz they were acting within acting so it's like he's acting like two different characters then you know he's himself you know he's book character and then he's the character when he's in the scenes that the character he's portraying is playing so I don't know that shit just lost me a little I like some of the old costumes I wish they'd honestly had a little bit more sexual in it you know they had some ladies I wouldn't mind seeing a even a blurry tit I'm saying I don't know how I'll take a picture I'll take a pixelated titty you know honestly maybe I'm just getting you know keto cuz it's winter and in people you know it's when are you start thinking about sex really because you want to survive and if you don't survive you want something to survive she want to see it out you want to see it out and get a woman but you know they'll eat up so you can something else can live actually that's a question that came in here

Always I put women on such a pedestal that that I think I couldn't believe there were even communicating with me so in 1 wood and then would stop or it was a girlfriend or someone have to be a girlfriend a girl I cared about man it just it was nothing left of me you know it just reinforced all these weird ideas or connections that I have with women where I just you know I think it went back to being a child and just you know my brother touched on it a little bit just that you know you have to find a way to I guess to connect with your children if possible unless they're supposed to be Killers or summer serial killers but you know in my I think I just didn't get that when I was young I didn't get that connection so when I would match up with a girl I felt like she was a all my affection for my mother immediately last on her once a girl love me or you know express that to me man I treated them like a mother and if I didn't do it on purpose you know I was still doing sex and doing tits and all of that and doing that you know when one girl you know masturbating me off in a water over there by you know over there about a move about kind of over by the movie theater but but I had this motherly issue where I would make them my mama and my heart somewhere and my heart would make a girl that I just cared about my mom and so when they left me a felt like like a my own mother was leaving me and so it just hit me I was just shattered so no dude I was fucking lay in the back and do a Newports bro Herman reading putting dark kind of stuff on my body want to be a black guy one time I was doing that you know I just wanted to not be myself I'm smoking Newports through my nose bro like a fucking straight Dragon bro like a Detroit dragon so I remember getting into the dark arts
