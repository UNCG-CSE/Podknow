hey what's going on it's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon just before Friday Monday Morning podcast and I am just checking in on motherfuker how are you everybody has how's your week going it's going to hang in there cuz it's already Thursday me and I hope you having a great week I'm having a great week my special came out and people save the Y cat I got to start doing some throw Cody if I'm going to fucking stop podcasting at like 5:32 in the morning I got to watch my my lovely daughter this morning so I got a knock this thing out while she still sleeping cuz Dad says the bad words so it works it's kind of cool getting up this early Minds you back in the day when I used to have a paper we get up at 5:45 in the morning every morning 365 days a year for years like fucking Jim Marshall 272 games in a row but I do like four years in a row we took a family trip no take a family trip and we had a goddamn adults who ran that fucking organization deliver it I got more goddamn complaints fucking lazy fuck that they gave the my paper to that week in a week was like four days assholes don't you see no just put like a rubber band or inelastic putting what part of the country you from around the newspaper you just fucking was doing the Kareem Skyhook cuz he's going down the street all my customers were bitching at me I want your way. I was like oh you don't know what you mean you should have told me no fucking ditto nowadays I've I was a little freckles back that I could have got out of my little smartphone to be like I just went on a family vacation in these people are being mean to me in the night they would all have to fucking issue an apology unfortunately I'm not getting that kind of crap with my special tipping happy but there's always a couple of fucking crusty C notes from a fucking Community College is going to give you shit but you know it just this just is what it is I will tell you what's fucking hilarious so is when you do like a radio tour to promote something what is so funny about the people that ask you questions is it okay if I did the exact same 10 jokes is every other comedian out there I would be considered a hack but if you're in journalism they can all ask you the exact same 10 questions and really not even pay attention to what it is that they're watching tone or the point you're trying to make it seek Zack saved 10 questions to the point you like why am I so just taking my dick out there my fucking special with that let's talk NFL football put it up put it up the fucking Saints won that game when I saw DeShawn what's-his-face I'm too old and remove any buddies name any more trouble for that touchdown when it was like fucking 50 seconds left to plays yeah right down the fucking field cuz everybody's Joe Montana now in the new new age of football right and I'm like Jesus Christ what the fuck and then the guy missed the extra point is kicking leg came down with this route with the kicking like Ken comes down then he's fine he's not vulnerable and he did a great WWE fucking pratfall I should say ww.w that's disrespectful some guy was never going to make the WWE fucking pratfall he got the kick it again they tie it up and now there's like I don't know what 30 seconds left Drew Brees two passes and then they kick a fucking field goal was ridiculous fucking ridiculous I don't know what I'm watching I feel like I'm I'm I'm watching a Hollywood movie about football what you just said that going that would never happen Jesus Christ by the time they got out of hot all this fucking game would be over not not today not these kids they play football the way those black dudes play chess in the park and when they put you on the fucking clock you sit down from your chess club colaba I actually headed to civil civil work you fucking chess club what you're used to sitting here studying the board for fucking 20 minutes before you even then you do that little awful thing you know with your hand before you grab your piece you know that that do she shifted with the salt when he salted that they any fucking brought his hand up and everybody lost their mind Jeff babe very interesting I don't know who the Patriots have next week all I know is a big question now is I just went underground so I didn't hear all that shit about Antonio Brown and all that I started to hear about her to whatever then I didn't hear anything else but you know that's what you do a special come out you just stay off the internet for 3 days but I had to pee to see how it was going you know I just want to sort of skimmed a little bit but you know he's got some serious accusations against him right which at this point which I don't I don't I don't understand these are accusations okay you're allegedly innocent until proven guilty and people are already say is already articles going off to if the NFL cares about women nail suspend him in it that's one of the funniest statements ever the NFL cares since when have they demonstrated they care about anybody even care about their own fucking players how long you think they knew what they all about the all of that CTE in the concussion sheet Jesus Christ I used to go to those fucking Hall of Fame give an artist the person get inducted into the fucking Hall of Fame what are you ever going to see old guy who's already been inducted comes over to fucking huggums you know with the yellow jacket on incomes hobble and fucking over they do with the game was due until then give a fuck about that the fucking show troops in the crowd and then they think they charge the military like it's a fucking commercial and they're acting like they're pay it they they their patriotic they just making money this Corporation truly cares you mean if you can fucking pressure them into doing what the fuck you wanted to do I don't know this is a tough one it's a really weird thing cuz you're innocent until proven guilty but then it's like such a fucking horrific charge but I really don't think it's any of my fucking business until a guilty verdict is in you know I don't understand why you don't generally speaking cuz I don't know this day and age of Faith they talk about the alleged victim but back in the day they always protected the alleged victim which they should but I also think that they shouldn't say the accused person's name until they're fucking convicted because anybody can say anybody did anything you can always just leave no accuse somebody of anything this guy stole my fucking car and then they got to investigate but I don't plaster your name all over the place and everybody thinks you're a fucking thief and considering the stigma that carries it's not something you shake off so I think that they should I don't know why had I think that they should protect everybody in it until somebody's proven guilty and then as far as like what is somebody plays in on him and I don't want to sports League everybody and evidently everybody on the internet does that's a tough one I say doesn't play and not because he allegedly rape somebody I don't think that's the name I think that's the number to reason I think the number one reason because he now plays for the Patriots Yeah that carries the extra the extra thing you know some out anything with any any gamesmanship we have is cheating any any cheating other teams have is gamesmanship you know you watch this shit you watched you you fucking watch the way this this filth somehow if this guy did this all right you watch out then they'll say the Patriots knew about it and yada yada yada and this is where the story is going to start just like that Mexican fentanyl that they start saying Mexican fentanyl with the shit Mexico I got to stop saying that I got to find out who created history of Fentanyl let's see here history of fat 10 oh my God I know how to spell this and a y l fentanyl Academy the history of the development of fentanyl I was just series on NBC what is the history of Fentanyl I thought it was initially for four people wounded severely on on the battlefield all right the company Jensen pharmacies first developed fentanyl 1959 then it was primarily used as an anesthetic and pain reliever for medical purposes during the 1960's fentanyl start to be used as an intravenous anesthetic called sublimaze it wasn't until the 1990s that the fentanyl patch was introducing to be used in the treatment of chronic pain after the introduction of the patch other ways of delivering fentanyl when introduced like the actiq lollipop I got I got to click on that what the fuck is that look like sippy some little kid with a fucking propeller hat on hilarious it goes right to act like a diction hotline where does fentanyl come from in regards to illicit use most retinol in the United States comes from China Chinese and we're fit fentanyl originate but because of the lack of regulations in the pharmaceutical industry the country is a large distributor of the debt will it come from China exports many different types of fentanyl products cleaning raw fentanyl fentanyl analogues of trying to fit prescription drugs like oxycodone that are laced with fentanyl that don't shed not fat no sorry while some fentanyl comes from China many other shipments of fentanyl will enter United States through Mexico Federal comes through Canada before I say so it is uncommon look at them protecting the white people there are there are different ways for Smugglers right who invented fentanyl okay here we go what country what country invented Fentanyl Jesus Christ they won't say it well if it comes with the corporation granted that none of them really have any loyalty to any country do they they just have loyalty to the dollar intravenous patches lodges adverse effects overdose pharmaceutical history I found was first synthesized in Belgium by Paul I'd say Johnson do they say Jansen under the label of his relatively new Leaf Ambience and pharmaceuticals in 1959 that's not even remotely how somebody talks in Belgium I'm doing the chef from The Muppet Show it was developed by screening chemicals similar to something or whatever that dine something for opioid activity the widespread use of fentanyl pregnyl trigger the production of fentanyl citrate fentanyl citrate man entered medical use as a general anesthetic in 1968 manufactured by the McNeil Laboratories McNeil sounds like now it's over in Ireland McNeil consumer Healthcare is an American Medicals Product Company belonging to the Johnson & Johnson product group is primarily primarily sells fast moving consumer goods such as over the counter drugs where you go this goddamn Mexican fentanyl I don't know what you guys think I don't think Anthony Brown I don't think he plays cuz it's not because the NFL cares just because it's post the cork flying off to me to bottle I say he does not play and then if this is found cuz he's claiming that it's he's being blackmailed which is also a very serious thing especially if you saying somebody did something like that so you got to figure out what the fuck is going on so probably the right thing to do is that he doesn't play while you sort it out but I don't think the right thing to do is to say his name until he was he's convicted of this shit you know the rest of his career no matter if he's innocent or not while he made his guilt he's not going to have it. But if you eat you know what people are going to yell and it'll be okay to yelled at cuz he's a guy all right I did Jimmy Kimmel show last night I had such a great time on that show I wish you guys could go backstage that that's one of the coolest fucking hangs it's like a little party back there was you play hanging out really positive and supportive and I was watching his monologue and I didn't see that I saw that clip of trump saying that shit with his wife going the hell's his wife name Melania fentanyl how do you say Millennial anyways saying she has he was talking about the Exxon that they had together saying she has a beautiful son and he goes up together you know I look at that guy a lot of times this is probably a bad thing to say about a president is I see myself I know exactly what the fuck that guys doing that that's when you're trying to think about what you want to say as you're still talking about some other shit anyway I got all that shit about trying to get together with the Taliban if anybody's tried this is like the second time it seems like he's tried to end shit and people won't let him do it when he tried to pull the troops out of Syria both Democrats and Republicans that's where my bread is buttered dead body I'm not saying I'm a fan but I am the fan of the female Soma alluded to the fact yeah that guy he got us into Iraq alluding to the fact that you know we're still there we don't have an exit strategy and it is costing us a fucking fortune only president that I've seen do that so I'm just trying to look at the glass being half-full like I said I am not a fan of Democrats or Republicans cuz they all fucking they were all hanging from the same owner anyways so let's get to some positive here thank you guys for all the kind words that you sent me I've taken a peek care of their little bit of emails little bit of this little bit of that but I was so proud of the special I'm glad the people seem to be looking at the special the same way that I am and I just taking him his jokes cuz that's all I mean I mean I'm not out there trying to fucking piss anybody off I'm just out there to have a little bit of fun and it's my job to talk about shit in the fucking news in most of my special is just about myself being an angry lunatic anyway so mostly you seem to realize that so there we go and with that all freckles freckles is putting the hour together again I got to show at the MGM National Harbor in Washington DC on October 5th and then I'm going to go see Tom Brady and the New England Patriots the next day play the Washington Redskins October 10th and 11th I'm at the the Thomas or Tomas depending what part of the world you from wolf or Wolfie Auditorium in the US Cellular Center on our way sounds like it's a bigger Arena and I'm getting the play The Little Theater downstairs I love it 10 that's going to be October 10th and 11th and then I'm going to be at the Mountain Winery all hello in Saratoga California think my wife isn't going to that one we can have a great time on that no Billy no booze in his watch his wife get a little tipsy October 18th and then October 21st I have return engagement at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas Nevada is it that it's my year that is my year just going to be out here doing probably I'll be adding some like local headline gigs testing out the new hour you know maybe San Diego maybe Fresno maybe San Jose maybe Bakersfield like doing some shit like that stuff that I can you know go to in just fucking I don't work this shit out to get ready to do it all over again and I'm very excited to work all of this stuff out very excited I'll you know any fucking excited about I got my own little flight simulator now so I can practice flying instrument Jesus Christ this is one of the hardest fucking things I've ever done anybody else there try to get their instrument rating Jesus Christ yesterday I literally had to tell the guy to stop I got my fucking head's going to explode because all right this is a good place to stop but you don't respond he was I thought just because I've been you know flying and looking at the gauges and cuz that's the only thing you look at while you're flying and I thought I would understand you know the the digital displays on airplanes a little more and when I went out to Vegas somebody in mind we're coming to see the show they ask for 10 tickets and they go we got it we're flying out there private we have an extra seat on the plane x a couple seats you and your wife can come along she was like all right beautiful so it was great we slept private and I turn into a pumpkin a fruit Southwest back bubble that shit I love it so I took a peek up into the cockpit and I didn't understand what was going on but just through my studies I I kind of learned about like what they do now is it kind of like what when they have them like they're not analog if they're just like a digital display electronic display they start combining instruments and just sticking them in different places and I just looked at it I could not make you know cuz he would sit there and you think you know when you have a pilot's license that you know just cuz you fly a helicopter that if something happened to the Jet Pilot you can go up there and fucking fly to God damn thing and I went up there to see like what degree of Tom Cruise I was and turned out it was a minus 6% I went up there as I got no fucking idea what anything is up here in a spaceship let me see something electronic display gauges jet let's see what the fuck this looks like images I guess it makes a little more yeah look what the fuck is that I understand that Gage is when they're showing like oil pressure and stuff like that but then these other things with the flap and there's some sort of green bad looking rainbow thing going on I have no idea what the fuck that is you have no fucking clue no clue but anyway I I got these it's incredible you can play video games since Grand Theft Auto 3 so I downloaded this this whole new this Flight Simulator game at home X-Plane 11 and then I ordered the Yoke the throttle with the flaps in the something else cuz it's all like fixed-wing and book Force helicopter shit if you want to get that it's like 10 times more expensive and all of this shit right so I just got the plain one cuz I just have to learn to fly by the gauges and I ordered that then yesterday I said fuck it and I got the the pedals or his wife to get what they call him and fixed-wing the fuck do they call him Rutter's so in all you do is just clamp it under your counter Clinton under the kitchen counter and I put my laptop there and then I'm Dino then I could even get I couldn't get the fucking parking brake off to even take off so I have to watch a YouTube video to figure out how to do that and then I'm going to be just flying by gauges the only thing is my laptop with my eyes it's too small and I was really trying to avoid having to buy a home computer but what would be the shit is I do have an Apple TV and I'm wondering if I can somehow if I could somehow hook it up to that and then it'd be more than big enough and then I can just sit here for a couple hours just trying to fly patterns trying to ascend and descend you know while mating the big thing is when you do what you have to maintain your AirSpeed which is harder are added area. Be like speeding up and slowing down when everybody's sitting there flying in the fucking clouds in a holding pattern waiting to figure out when they're going to give you the clearance to land and even though this is some shit I'm never going to use because everything that I fly doesn't have an autopilot so it's not rated to fly instrument anyway all my instructors always said if you get your instrument license you're going to be such a better pilot you going to fly someone so much more precise so I figure if I get this and then I take that Robinson safety course then all freckles can start looking into buying an old helicopters that's the next move and my instructor actually showed me one it was a something called a gazelle which I never heard of and I don't blame you answered your how how little time I have for this shit is because I got we've got to rent fucking helicopters and stuff like that but if I can find some that has like a thousand fucking hours left on it and it'll take me like 10 years to do that so it which point I'll be in my goddamn 60s G but I know it's truly truly a fascinating fascinating fucking thing oh by the way I did a great radio show that I was not even aware of that existed out there topic Papa and Fortune feimster have this this ship lollipop and theme song I believe and I think it's on the Netflix radio network they are two of my favorite comedians and people and I went on there and had such a great time and Fortune said the funniest fucking thing is Tom brought up the fact that I was going for my instrument rating or something like that and she was just like what does that mean and I was explaining it to her and she goes so what can you do now at the private license in as I was explaining to her visual flight rules she goes out so basically you can fly when it's nice out and I was like you know what I'm still in that I'm giving you credit for it but anybody asked me what is your pilot's license in sale right now and that is that is basically at I can fly when it's nice out which is why I am going for this fucking thing right now because you know even out here in La it's never 100% nice out in the, the winds are the lower the visibility because it's not getting all that fucking you all the shit that gets into the air do you know what some of some of it is actually like just from human beings in your skin shedding is some of the ship that goes up into the air along with cars kicking up ship from the road construction sites and then all the emissions from all the stuff that we use all of that is combined in there all right you're a she fucken feet and somebody's fucking old muscle car it's all there flying around in the fucking windhoek gross is that a little bit of advertising here all

Buccaneers in November so much he tried to say hey and all those people look at like fucking Matt Cassel I love that because he went 11-5 8 year not realizing the Patriots went 16 and no in the regular-season the year before he took over a 16 and 18 and 1/5 fewer fucking games all right he was a game manager whatever you do Matt don't throw an interception will handle the rest Canadians were watching am driving a goddamn Ferrari what's the New England Patriots with the guy and he gets that huge contract goes to Kansas City and what's he doing out there what's he doing out there what's he doing what happened today they lost to the fucking bills 41 to 7 I'm fucking believable I give up I officially fucking give up I I am not having these arguments anymore this year if you guys this is okay agree to disagree if you want 5000 yards in the regular season and then to lose in the first round or the second round even though you have the game 1 I think that's your guy that is your fucking guy all right God bless you God bless you what the fuck am I hear you compatible right off the bat I like this we talked and she gave me her digits I called it at night mistake I don't know I don't know it's not a big motherfuking mistake you can give him call it at nice to be like you still like me I don't think that they would be a problem at this point everybody knows you're supposed to wait the day so call the first night no answer she called me a few days later from her landline number left me a message didn't hear from her for a few weeks after that she text me one morning and we started going back and forth from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. everyday talking on the phone I don't know what that means she told me she had a little crush on me from when we met have a Gruen to her wanting to date me so this is all gone so far everybody around the end of July she didn't respond to any of my texts or respond to me soon Jesus Christ you referred to her dad sent him out to the podium like Brian Cashman the beginning of September so because of her school from 2:30 to 8:30 p.m. she told me she loved me all you guys have done is text and you fell in love that way oh you wacky kids this day this day in age okay Friday after school started invited me to it she was beautiful nice body great personalities that's hilarious quote her older brother I told her off to the side to give her a present and she smiled and gave me a hug after she opened it later her parents stop through the house and start to the party they pull over to the side and talk with her I leave the party and she gave me a long hug and a smile on her face the whole time spoke with my dad my dad's White and her family is all white to stay and drink a beer or three for the road or non see-through bottle was fucked up to keep pressuring someone about a beer after they said no Twice as is getting a little next day at work she text me and said that she had bad news news was that a parents didn't want to date me because they just didn't like me and thought she made a bad decision which I took as he's a Black is Black so no she kept saying sorry I kept telling her it wasn't her fault just to parents of fucked up I can tell me last night to her and I went cursing out of parents via text when I didn't mean all that I just found out of parents don't want me talking to her at all and I block my number from her phone because I haven't felt this way about a girl in a while and I want to fight I just don't know how knee is available to help me out with some advice for trying to win her over to win over our parents and showing them not some random black I'll try. I'll definitely try not to hurt who gives a shit who gives a fuck with their parents think I would just completely if I was you ignore her parents and ignore their wishes and still be the funny cool guy that she likes and eventually she's got a deal with the parents but this is what I wouldn't get any more this is a tricky one because I won't get any more emotionally involved with this girl because if you start falling for this girl and then again her parents rip the rug out and she says go fuck it yourself I can't that you're going to end up getting hurt how you do this one and put it on the table here and know that I could get fucking squashed like a goddamn squirrel on the side of the road this is hard cuz you like this girl but totally emotionless this girl just shows you her parents relationship with your parents over you right out of the fucking gate you don't need that shit okay you want somebody who's strong enough to be to date who they want to date and keep the parents and check not disrespect of them don't disrespect him but understand that it's their life they got to lead break all right shout the fact that she did do that is a major red flag you sound like this this kind of the other girls out there you know what that's my advice okay just got to be other girls just get out there all right and find some girl that's going to like you and can introduce you to their parents and her parents are cool with you that's a good way to start off because this girl is a tried to basically talk your dad to a DUI the cycle fucking family is in that woman and you're going to breed with it and half is going to be a little fucking crazy and one night you're going to be sleeping you can have for some reason this girl fuck her fucking family all right she probably smart you probably invent the next Grey's computer or car going to make money in life actually you being half black it was a way for you to figure out how weak this is this girl is around around God damn if it wasn't this it would be something else to someone to be micromanaged in the daughters dating life to that fucking level is just the tip of the test and she failed it so fuck her go find somebody else you can go after I'm just letting you know what you all right because that's never going to accept assholes which I mean I mean what the fuk just happened did Serena already win there already interviewing her they're both smiling she must have lost anyways let's get to overrated underrated for the week overrated seeing a big love before they get big and fucking sell out and change their sound you got to change it to have to evolve if you don't you just keep out the same which is a question the biggest sellout what band hurt you the most is it be a lot of Metallica fans when he went from a Injustice for all and then they went to Enter Sandman that Bob Seger cover I'm sure this could be a lot of Metallica fans out there maybe even a couple of Bryan Adams it was pop ball Stewart sang that song about fucking around shopping shopping fucking figured you was my girl was in the other room Lovejoy he went from talking about fucking around getting some

still fucking shake it off all right overrated keeping the peace specifically this really just means you're you're being a pussy or chickening out because you you don't have the heart of the balls to follow through on something that you have on your mind which leads me to an underrated confrontation or grown man moves recently I was on a plane and the announcement just to put all electrical equipment Etc way as usual was the one continues to talk on a cell phone or sent emails or something but I have never said anything about it other gentleman beside me reaches across the aisle to call the attention of a douchebag and says to excuse me sir you are supposed to put that away this is none of the old guy's business but this is how you how you know he was right the douchebag basically

this thing out while she still sleeping cuz Dad says the bad words so it works it's kind of cool getting up this early Minds you back in the day when I used to have a paper we get up at 5:45 in the morning every morning 365 days a year for years like fucking Jim Marshall 272 games in a row but I do like four years in a row we took a family trip no take a family trip and we had a goddamn adults who ran that fucking organization deliver it I got more goddamn complaints fucking lazy fuck that they gave the my paper to that week in a week was like four days assholes don't you see no just put like a rubber band or inelastic putting what part of the country you from around the newspaper you just fucking was doing the Kareem Skyhook cuz he's going down the street all my customers were bitching at me I want your way. I was like oh you don't know what you mean you should have told me no fucking ditto nowadays I've I was a little freckles back that I could have got out of my little smartphone to be like I just went on a family vacation in these people are being mean to me in the night they would all have to fucking issue an apology unfortunately I'm not getting that kind of crap with my special tipping happy but there's always a couple of fucking crusty C notes from a fucking Community College is going to give you shit but you know it just this just is what it is I will tell you what's fucking hilarious so is when you do like a radio tour to promote something what is so funny about the people that ask you questions is it okay if I did the exact same 10 jokes is every other comedian out there I would be considered a hack but if you're in journalism they can all ask you the exact same 10 questions and really not even pay attention to what it is that they're watching tone or are the point you're trying to make it seeks Zack saved 10 questions to the point you like why am I so just taking my dick out there my fucking special with that let's talk NFL football put it up put it up the fucking Saints won that game when I saw DeShawn what's-his-face I'm too old and remove any buddies name any more trouble for that touchdown when it was like fucking 50 seconds left to plays yeah right down the fucking field cuz everybody's Joe Montana now in the new new age of football right and I'm like Jesus Christ what the fuck and then the guy missed the extra point is kicking leg came down with this route with the kicking like Ken comes down then he's fine he's not vulnerable and he did a great WWE fucking pratfall I should say ww.w that's disrespectful some guy was never going to make the WWE fucking pratfall he got the kick it again they tie it up and now there's like I don't know what 30 seconds left Drew Brees two passes and then they kick a fucking field goal was ridiculous fucking ridiculous I don't know what I'm watching I feel like I'm I'm I'm watching a Hollywood movie about football what you just said that going that would never happen Jesus Christ by the time they got out of hot all this fucking game would be over not not today not these kids they play football the way those black dudes play chess in the park and when they put you on the fucking clock you sit down from your chess club colaba I actually headed to civil civil work you fucking chess club what you're used to sitting here studying the board for fucking 20 minutes before you even then you do that little awful thing you know with your hand before you grab your piece you know that that do she shifted with the salt when he salted that they any fucking brought his hand up and everybody lost their mind Jeff babe very interesting I don't know who the Patriots have next week all I know is a big question now is I just went underground so I didn't hear all that shit about Antonio Brown and all that I started to hear about her to whatever then I didn't hear anything else but you know that's what you do a special come out you just stay off the internet for 3 days but I had to pee to see how it was going you know I just want to sort of skimmed a little bit but you know he's got some serious accusations against him right which at this point which I don't I don't I don't understand these are accusations okay you're allegedly innocent until proven guilty and people are already say is already articles going off to if the NFL cares about women nail suspend him in it that's one of the funniest statements ever the NFL cares since when have they demonstrated they care about anybody even care about their own fucking players how long you think they knew what they all about the all of that CTE in the concussion sheet Jesus Christ I used to go to those fucking Hall of Fame give an artist the person get inducted into the fucking Hall of Fame what are you ever going to see old guy who's already been inducted comes over to fucking huggums you know with the yellow jacket on incomes hobble and fucking over they do with the game was due until then give a fuck about that the fucking show troops in the crowd and then they think they charge the military like it's a fucking commercial and they're acting like they're pay it they they their patriotic they just making money this Corporation truly cares you mean if you can fucking pressure them into doing what the fuck you wanted to do I don't know this is a tough one it's a really weird thing cuz you're innocent until proven guilty but then it's like such a fucking horrific charge but I really don't think it's any of my fucking business until a guilty verdict is in you know I don't understand why you don't generally speaking cuz I don't know this day and age of Faith they talk about the alleged victim but back in the day they always protected the alleged victim which they should but I also think that they shouldn't say the accused person's name until they're fucking convicted because anybody can say anybody did anything you can always just leave no accuse somebody of anything this guy stole my fucking car and then they got to investigate but I don't plaster your name all over the place and everybody thinks you're a fucking thief and considering the stigma that carries it's not something you shake off so I think that they should I don't know why had I think that they should protect everybody in it until somebody's proven guilty and then as far as like what is somebody plays in on him and I don't want to sports League everybody and evidently everybody on the internet does that's a tough one I say doesn't play and not because he allegedly rape somebody I don't think that's the name I think that's the number to reason I think the number one reason because he now plays for the Patriots Yeah that carries the extra the extra thing you know some out anything with any any gamesmanship we have is cheating any any cheating other teams have is gamesmanship you know you watch this shit you watched you you fucking watch the way this this filth somehow if this guy did this all right you watch out then they'll say the Patriots knew about it and yada yada yada and this is where the story is going to start just like that Mexican fentanyl that they start saying Mexican fentanyl with the shit Mexico I got to stop saying that I got to find out who created history of Fentanyl let's see here history of fat 10 oh my God I know how to spell this and a y l fentanyl Academy the history of the development of fentanyl I was just series on NBC what is the history of Fentanyl I thought it was initially for four people wounded severely on on the battlefield all right the company Jensen pharmacies first developed fentanyl 1959 then it was primarily used as an anesthetic and pain reliever for medical purposes during the 1960's fentanyl start to be used as an intravenous anesthetic called sublimaze it wasn't until the 1990s that the fentanyl patch was introducing to be used in the treatment of chronic pain after the introduction of the patch other ways of delivering fentanyl when introduced like the actiq lollipop I got I got to click on that what the fuck is that look like sippy some little kid with a fucking propeller hat on hilarious it goes right to act like a diction hotline where does fentanyl come from in regards to illicit use most retinol in the United States comes from China Chinese and we're fit fentanyl originate but because of the lack of regulations in the pharmaceutical industry the country is a large distributor of the debt will it come from China exports many different types of fentanyl products cleaning raw fentanyl fentanyl analogues of trying to fit prescription drugs like oxycodone that are laced with fentanyl that don't shed not fat no sorry while some fentanyl comes from China many other shipments of fentanyl will enter United States through Mexico Federal comes through Canada before I say so it is uncommon look at them protecting the white people there are there are different ways for Smugglers right who invented fentanyl okay here we go what country what country invented Fentanyl Jesus Christ they won't say it well if it comes with the corporation granted that none of them really have any loyalty to any country do they they just have loyalty to the dollar intravenous patches lodges adverse effects overdose pharmaceutical history I found was first synthesized in Belgium by Paul I'd say Johnson do they say Jansen under the label of his relatively new Leaf Ambience and pharmaceuticals in 1959 that's not even remotely how somebody talks in Belgium I'm doing the chef from The Muppet Show it was developed by screening chemicals similar to something or whatever that dine something for opioid activity the widespread use of fentanyl pregnyl trigger the production of fentanyl citrate fentanyl citrate man entered medical use as a general anesthetic in 1968 manufactured by the McNeil Laboratories McNeil sounds like now it's over in Ireland McNeil consumer Healthcare is an American Medicals Product Company belonging to the Johnson & Johnson product group is primarily primarily sells fast moving consumer goods such as over the counter drugs where you go this goddamn Mexican fentanyl I don't know what you guys think I don't think Anthony Brown I don't think he plays cuz it's not because the NFL cares just because it's post the cork flying off to me to bottle I say he does not play and then if this is found cuz he's claiming that it's he's being blackmailed which is also a very serious thing especially if you saying somebody did something like that so you got to figure out what the fuck is going on so probably the right thing to do is that he doesn't play while you sort it out but I don't think the right thing to do is to say his name until he was he's convicted of this shit you know the rest of his career no matter if he's innocent or not while he made his guilt he's not going to have it. But if you eat you know what people are going to yell and it'll be okay to yelled at cuz he's a guy all right I did Jimmy Kimmel show last night I had such a great time on that show I wish you guys could go backstage that that's one of the coolest fucking hangs it's like a little party back there was you play hanging out really positive and supportive and I was watching his monologue and I didn't see that I saw that clip of trump saying that shit with his wife going the hell's his wife name Melania fentanyl how do you say Millennial anyways saying she has he was talking about the Exxon that they had together saying she has a beautiful son and he goes up together you know I look at that guy a lot of times this is probably a bad thing to say about a president is I see myself I know exactly what the fuck that guys doing that that's when you're trying to think about what you want to say as you're still talking about some other shit anyway I got all that shit about trying to get together with the Taliban if anybody's tried this is like the second time it seems like he's tried to end shit and people won't let him do it when he tried to pull the troops out of Syria both Democrats and Republicans that's where my bread is buttered dead body I'm not saying I'm a fan but I am the fan of the female Soma alluded to the fact yeah that guy he got us into Iraq alluding to the fact that you know we're still there we don't have an exit strategy and it is costing us a fucking fortune only president that I've seen do that so I'm just trying to look at the glass being half-full like I said I am not a fan of Democrats or Republicans cuz they all fucking they were all hanging from the same owner anyways so let's get to some positive here thank you guys for all the kind words that you sent me I've taken a peek care of their little bit of emails little bit of this little bit of that but I was so proud of the special I'm glad the people seem to be looking at the special the same way that I am and I just taking him his jokes cuz that's all I mean I mean I'm not out there trying to fucking piss anybody off I'm just out there to have a little bit of fun and it's my job to talk about shit in the fucking news in most of my special is just about myself being an angry lunatic anyway so mostly you seem to realize that so there we go and with that all freckles freckles is putting the hour together again I got to show at the MGM National Harbor in Washington DC on October 5th and then I'm going to go see Tom Brady and the New England Patriots the next day play the Washington Redskins October 10th and 11th I'm at the the Thomas or Tomas depending what part of the world you from wolf or Wolfie Auditorium in the US Cellular Center on our way sounds like it's a bigger Arena and I'm getting the play The Little Theater downstairs I love it 10 that's going to be October 10th and 11th and then I'm going to be at the Mountain Winery all hello in Saratoga California think my wife isn't going to that one we can have a great time on that no Billy no booze in his watch his wife get a little tipsy October 18th and then October 21st I have return engagement at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas Nevada is it that it's my year that is my year just going to be out here doing probably I'll be adding some like local headline gigs testing out the new hour you know maybe San Diego maybe Fresno maybe San Jose maybe Bakersfield like doing some shit like that stuff that I can you know go to in just fucking I don't work this shit out to get ready to do it all over again and I'm very excited to work all of this stuff out very excited I'll you know any fucking excited about I got my own little flight simulator now so I can practice flying instrument Jesus Christ this is one of the hardest fucking things I've ever done anybody else there try to get their instrument rating Jesus Christ yesterday I literally had to tell the guy to stop I got my fucking head's going to explode because all right this is a good place to stop but you don't respond he was I thought just because I've been you know flying and looking at the gauges and cuz that's the only thing you look at while you're flying and I thought I would understand you know the the digital displays on airplanes a little more and when I went out to Vegas somebody in mind we're coming to see the show they ask for 10 tickets and they go we got it we're flying out there private we have an extra seat on the plane x a couple seats you and your wife can come along she was like all right beautiful so it was great we slept private and I turn into a pumpkin a fruit Southwest back bubble that shit I love it so I took a peek up into the cockpit and I didn't understand what was going on but just through my studies I I kind of learned about like what they do now is it kind of like what when they have them like they're not analog if they're just like a digital display electronic display they start combining instruments and just sticking them in different places and I just looked at it I could not make you know cuz he would sit there and you think you know when you have a pilot's license that you know just cuz you fly a helicopter that if something happened to the Jet Pilot you can go up there and fucking fly to God damn thing and I went up there to see like what degree of Tom Cruise I was and turned out it was a minus 6% I went up there as I got no fucking idea what anything is up here in a spaceship let me see something electronic display gauges jet let's see what the fuck this looks like images I guess it makes a little more yeah look what the fuck is that I understand that Gage is when they're showing like oil pressure and stuff like that but then these other things with the flap and there's some sort of green bad looking rainbow thing going on I have no idea what the fuck that is you have no fucking clue no clue but anyway I I got these it's incredible you can play video games since Grand Theft Auto 3 so I downloaded this this whole new this Flight Simulator game at home X-Plane 11 and then I ordered the Yoke the throttle with the flaps in the something else cuz it's all like fixed-wing and book Force helicopter shit if you want to get that it's like 10 times more expensive and all of this shit right so I just got the plain one cuz I just have to learn to fly by the gauges and I ordered that then yesterday I said fuck it and I got the the pedals or his wife to get what they call him and fixed-wing the fuck do they call him Rutter's so in all you do is just clamp it under your counter Clinton under the kitchen counter and I put my laptop there and then I'm Dino then I could even get I couldn't get the fucking parking brake off to even take off so I have to watch a YouTube video to figure out how to do that and then I'm going to be just flying by gauges the only thing is my laptop with my eyes it's too small and I was really trying to avoid having to buy a home computer but what would be the shit is I do have an Apple TV and I'm wondering if I can somehow if I could somehow hook it up to that and then it'd be more than big enough and then I can just sit here for a couple hours just trying to fly patterns trying to ascend and descend you know while mating the big thing is when you do what you have to maintain your AirSpeed which is harder are added area. Be like speeding up and slowing down when everybody's sitting there flying in the fucking clouds in a holding pattern waiting to figure out when they're going to give you the clearance to land and even though this is some shit I'm never going to use because everything that I fly doesn't have an autopilot so it's not rated to fly instrument anyway all my instructors always said if you get your instrument license you're going to be such a better pilot you going to fly someone so much more precise so I figure if I get this and then I take that Robinson safety course then all freckles can start looking into buying an old helicopters that's the next move and my instructor actually showed me one it was a something called a gazelle which I never heard of and I don't blame you answered your how how little time I have for this shit is because I got we've got to rent fucking helicopters and stuff like that but if I can find some that has like a thousand fucking hours left on it and it'll take me like 10 years to do that so it which point I'll be in my goddamn 60s G but I know it's truly truly a fascinating fascinating fucking thing oh by the way I did a great radio show that I was not even aware of that existed out there topic Papa and Fortune feimster have this this ship lollipop and theme song I believe and I think it's on the Netflix radio network they are two of my favorite comedians and people and I went on there and had such a great time and Fortune said the funniest fucking thing is Tom brought up the fact that I was going for my instrument rating or something like that and she was just like what does that mean and I was explaining it to her and she goes so what can you do now at the private license in as I was explaining to her visual flight rules she goes out so basically you can fly when it's nice out and I was like you know what I'm still in that I'm giving you credit for it but anybody asked me what is your pilot's license in sale right now and that is that is basically at I can fly when it's nice out which is why I am going for this fucking thing right now because you know even out here in La it's never 100% nice out in the, the winds are the lower the visibility because it's not getting all that fucking you all the shit that gets into the air do you know what some of some of it is actually like just from human beings in your skin shedding is some of the ship that goes up into the air along with cars kicking up ship from the road construction sites and then all the emissions from all the stuff that we use all of that is combined in there all right you're a she fucken feet and somebody's fucking old muscle car it's all there flying around in the fucking windhoek gross is that a little bit of advertising here all

fucking home he doesn't throw a pick-six to lose the fucking Super Bowl I am so goddamn sick of people talking about game 16 I said it for fucking years if you want five touchdowns against the Buccaneers in November so much he tried to say hey and all those people look at like fucking Matt Cassel I love that because he went 11-5 8 year not realizing the Patriots went 16 and no in the regular-season the year before he took over a 16 and 18 and 1/5 fewer fucking games all right he was a game manager whatever you do Matt don't throw an interception will handle the rest Canadians were watching am driving a goddamn Ferrari what's the New England Patriots with the guy and he gets that huge contract goes to Kansas City and what's he doing out there what's he doing out there what's he doing what happened today they lost to the fucking bills 41 to 7 I'm fucking believable I give up I officially fucking give up I I am not having these arguments anymore this year if you guys this is okay agree to disagree if you want 5000 yards in the regular season and then to lose in the first round or the second round even though you have the game 1 I think that's your guy that is your fucking guy all right God bless you God bless you what the fuck am I hear you compatible right off the bat I like this we talked and she gave me her digits I called it at night mistake I don't know I don't know it's not a big motherfuking mistake you can give him call it at nice to be like you still like me I don't think that they would be a problem at this point everybody knows you're supposed to wait the day so call the first night no answer she called me a few days later from her landline number left me a message didn't hear from her for a few weeks after that she text me one morning and we started going back and forth from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. everyday talking on the phone I don't know what that means she told me she had a little crush on me from when we met have a Gruen to her wanting to date me so this is all gone so far everybody around the end of July she didn't respond to any of my texts or respond to me soon Jesus Christ you referred to her dad sent him out to the podium like Brian Cashman the beginning of September so because of her school from 2:30 to 8:30 p.m. she told me she loved me all you guys have done is text and you fell in love that way oh you wacky kids this day this day in age okay Friday after school started invited me to it she was beautiful nice body great personalities that's hilarious quote her older brother I told her off to the side to give her a present and she smiled and gave me a hug after she opened it later her parents stop through the house and start to the party they pull over to the side and talk with her I leave the party and she gave me a long hug and a smile on her face the whole time spoke with my dad my dad's White and her family is all white to stay and drink a beer or three for the road or non see-through bottle was fucked up to keep pressuring someone about a beer after they said no Twice as is getting a little next day at work she text me and said that she had bad news news was that a parents didn't want to date me because they just didn't like me and thought she made a bad decision which I took as he's a Black is Black so no she kept saying sorry I kept telling her it wasn't her fault just to parents of fucked up I can tell me last night to her and I went cursing out of parents via text when I didn't mean all that I just found out of parents don't want me talking to her at all and I block my number from her phone because I haven't felt this way about a girl in a while and I want to fight I just don't know how knee is available to help me out with some advice for trying to win her over to win over our parents and showing them not some random black I'll try. I'll definitely try not to hurt who gives a shit who gives a fuck with their parents think I would just completely if I was you ignore her parents and ignore their wishes and still be the funny cool guy that she likes and eventually she's got a deal with the parents but this is what I wouldn't get any more this is a tricky one because I won't get any more emotionally involved with this girl because if you start falling for this girl and then again her parents rip the rug out and she says go fuck it yourself I can't that you're going to end up getting hurt how you do this one and put it on the table here and know that I could get fucking squashed like a goddamn squirrel on the side of the road this is hard cuz you like this girl but totally emotionless this girl just shows you her parents relationship with your parents over you right out of the fucking gate you don't need that shit okay you want somebody who's strong enough to be to date who they want to date and keep the parents and check not disrespect of them don't disrespect him but understand that it's their life they got to lead break all right shout the fact that she did do that is a major red flag you sound like this this kind of the other girls out there you know what that's my advice okay just got to be other girls just get out there all right and find some girl that's going to like you and can introduce you to their parents and her parents are cool with you that's a good way to start off because this girl is a tried to basically talk your dad to a DUI the cycle fucking family is in that woman and you're going to breed with it and half is going to be a little fucking crazy and one night you're going to be sleeping you can have for some reason this girl fuck her fucking family all right she probably smart you probably invent the next Grey's computer or car going to make money in life actually you being half black it was a way for you to figure out how weak this is this girl is around around God damn if it wasn't this it would be something else to someone to be micromanaged in the daughters dating life to that fucking level is just the tip of the test and she failed it so fuck her go find somebody else you can go after I'm just letting you know what you all right because that's never going to accept assholes which I mean I mean what the fuk just happened did Serena already win there already interviewing her they're both smiling she must have lost anyways let's get to overrated underrated for the week overrated seeing a big love before they get big and fucking sell out and change their sound you got to change it to have to evolve if you don't you just keep out the same which is a question the biggest sellout what band hurt you the most is it be a lot of Metallica fans when he went from a Injustice for all and then they went to Enter Sandman that Bob Seger cover I'm sure this could be a lot of Metallica fans out there maybe even a couple of Bryan Adams it was pop ball Stewart sang that song about fucking around shopping shopping fucking figured you was my girl was in the other room Lovejoy he went from talking about fucking around getting some
