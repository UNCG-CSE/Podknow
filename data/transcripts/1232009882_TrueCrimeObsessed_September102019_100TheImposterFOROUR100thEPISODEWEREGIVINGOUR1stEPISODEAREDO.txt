I'm just saying I'm calling the bullshit button on the fact that his disappearance in make the news key is the exact kind of kid especially at that time disappearance would make all the news regardless of how poor they were so busy but never one so now three years and 4 months after The Disappearance of Nicholas Barclay we're suddenly in Spain 7 we got this police audio someone's calling the cops saying hey look I'm a tourist vacation with my wife we found this kid is probably about 14 years old he doesn't have any ID on him he's terrified you guys going to be here or not everything is so the Imposter write the Imposter is our main narrator hear us he is the definition of an unreliable narrator the most important thing for me he's an imposter spoiler immediately call the family in Texas without doing any investigation whatsoever and they're like hey we found that can spin like a sight unseen and I'm just like this is already so I got to also say my favorite person in the world sister Carrie zactly sure where Spain is ecstatic bewildered you know Spain is not like a cross the country he thinks it's on the other side of the country I know she's Miss speaking I know that no matter if someone in her family is responsible for next disappearance or not she's going through it I don't think she had anything to do with it the reporting she misspoke but it's the first of many things that she says we're kind of like I'll carry sweetheart when she said that the director was like oh keep the camera on this one she's going to have some oats porridge I did this for us to go outside so Kerry Gibson is a sister right Brian her husband's superhot the cops are calling so I don't seem like we found we found that carries that describe saying all these words again the mother Beverly right would never lie to her like we were elated couldn't wait and Brian is the only person who uses words like worrisome. Course it was mysterious it was exciting it was worrisome it was all mixed emotions you know I don't like they totally got in a fight over this Mike Carey screaming just let me have this and Brian side but I love you and I just want to make sure that you've been through enough like how can I just ask some questions and she's screaming Brian know and he's like okay fine and that he likes us quietly eating like a TV dinner earlier like they found them put this then we come to this real weird looking guy now we need the Imposter you guys he is wearing the goddamn ugliest shirt I have ever seen a blue shirt we only see it for like a shoulder what that's the thing about I really really hated a shark what can we say we're talking to the Imposter and his ugly shirt to see some of the best reenactments we've ever seen a documentary with those I love I love these great documentary to be our first because to give a kid a child would you need to to love that kid nobody ever gave a damn about me and to know that Sky change my daddy the reward was eventually to be put in a place where I treated you really cared about me hell yeah I mean I wish we were born I was born again and he admitted that he's the one that was in the phone with the whole thing is fake and I'm the one who made this whole thing he's telling us at like look I'm a 23 year old guy I'm out in the cold no one's ever loved me I'm just trying to find a place where I can go where I was going to give a fuck about me I wanted them to like a kids home shelter music I've been doing this for a long time is he this good at it cuz it's pouring rain I'm like to heal a check the weather and make sure it was raining as possible notice I'm terrified kid who can't speak in the rain and he's saying like very important for me to be a black one it would see me with some big Coast with the younger clothes and they would see a kid with a hat which is very low in the eyes couldn't see my eyes can I get a sense of guilt being able to be close to a kids witch is dead scared when the cops show up all about manipulating them making them feel sorry for me making them ask me horrible questions about like have I been sexually abused me what tried it like reach out and like take his hand and he would honestly like for someone who is an imposter one of the most honest people we've ever seen any of these documents because he's clearly as anybody else editing in this is so well done that while people are talking about horrible things that he described you will cut it him like looking down and I'm looking up and smiling more like back in Texas we learn about the day that Nick went missing this is the thing that makes me crazy Nicholas Barclay gets lost in this documentary situation sometimes where the victim gets lost here but here's what we learn his mom Beverly said yeah you can go to play basketball or whatever we have to be home by dinner here's five bucks and I'll see you later Beverly worked nights so she slept all day long wait so he called home you start seeing results so Nicholas calls home asking for a ride from the basketball court and his older brother Jason answers the phone when I called and wanted to ride home to Jason didn't want to wake me up so tell him he had to walk home and that's what's the day the last time we ordered from them that's the story of Nick going stay at some point like he probably just got in a car somebody said paid you need a ride and Nick just got in the car and whatever that person's nefarious intentions were is what came to pass again this where I ask a question when was he reported missing so now we're back with the Imposter and he says this thing where he's like talking to the cops before he goes to the Children's Home yes I all I did was wait out the cops cuz if I don't speak and they don't know why they can't charge me anything they just have like put me in a kids home which is exactly what you want it's a twenty-three-year-old which is what's going on I don't really think this guy just like security kind of like a really bad person but he says the cops Who You Are I couldn't allow that to happen I have to find a way out of that what just fingerprint the kid right just take this is just the beginning of every single thing he saying you're given the option of a fingerprint or not but also the same time if you were a cop who fell for this 23 year old would you want to be on camera they're mad that he was one of those places which is very rare in Spain but they kind of can't stand it when a kid doesn't have an ID card so the only thing left one go to prison to prove to them that I'm someone run away and only he can contact his family himself and he's like so I convinced them these like grown-ass adults have been doing this for a long time look look it doesn't just leave me as you hold on a second you take a seat just turn it off he's like okay I'll just stay here in your office totally by myself you guys go home and get some sleep all night long all night long so you lie cuz of the time difference you see it so he's like you just leave me alone a kid or runaway who's not speaking who is totally sexually abused according to you and also me and my demeanor are tomorrow by the time you come back to work tomorrow I'm going to have everything you need let me make a phone call she has you go to bed you look tired and in the reenactment you see the sort of like severe looking women like looking at her colleagues is it okay if I leave for the night but the thing is they do this really really cool edit move where they like have his audio and telling the story presently and they make it sound like a telephone so I called American bullies cancel Kentucky Fowler New York police return project office different police station in space that we had found a kid that is from the states he's like left to his own devices according to him and all night long and he starts making these phone calls and he's trying to figure out like who's missing who can I be what's going on who can I act as there's a great film making thing that this guy does hear he's we're being told by The Imposter that he's calling like the United States are on the receiving end of these phone calls is like stock footage from like Columbo but the thing is he's making all these calls and he's everything he says is very vague cuz he's acting like I have this kid with me and I don't know if it's going to match who is missing in your town the kid he's wearing a shirt he has eyes and hair and two arms what do you got for me so they're just sending their entire like roster of missing children Nicholas Barclay comes up and because it's 1997 apparently they didn't have color printers back then they like fax this photo and he's like something to see if it's him like let me see if I can pull off neck Parkway do it I look at it black and white picture old picture well missing for three or four years guarantee one thing it will be a change if there is a chance they will be doubt if there is doubt then I got a chance something in my head decided that could do it that I had to try old black-and-white facts of Nicholas fax fax everybody back in the day children gather around you used to be able to send like email through the phone it's super crazy and it's really thin and it was really black and white and gray knee and smudgy and ridiculous so like I can totally do this I can totally be necklace and the Imposter as a cop is like hey you know we got Moxie and you never going to believe it but this is him break acne under lazy your Betta is gorgeous today being is gay for makeup yet all about doing more with less and cruelty-free ingredients I know you love that animals I don't know what you're putting on your face and then my favorite thing it's the play all day translucent powder on like a cakey I know it just like always light at setting and then I don't have to think about it or touch up for the rest of the day are you wearing it now cuz you're just left right right right tell the people how they get Wonder Duty and they must get the full effect without a full makeup routine at wanderbeauty.com TC out that's Wonder beauty.com DC over 20% off of beauty.com now we're back to Sister Carrie and apparently the mom has gotten a call from the missing and exploited children and she immediately cause carry with the news but I can't pronounce anything to either so I'm not going to shame him for that okay well where in Texas is leonora's Texas has a lot of small town and then I'm like Spain to carry calls the shelter of course carries like I'm going to call the shelter and like talk to my brother oh my God carry calls back the Imposter answers pretending to be the policeman sitting up and ran like the other name for it I like a super American name generator lights all right I thought your brother sitting right here unfortunately he tells me he doesn't really remember anything about his old life and he's so traumatized that he's not speak which is also a real thing that happened we were told he was held by some kind of like a sex play my kind of ring and that he had escaped from there and that he was found wandering the streets I wanted to hear his voice no way I was going to talk to her pretending to be naked as because she was sister so it's also really sad because this movie has moments like this where you're seeing Carrie getting really emotional learning that like her brother was a sex slave and now he's safe and she just wants to talk to him and then it comes to the Imposter and he's like chuckling about being nervous I like pretend to be Nicholas on the phone like I'm not going to do anything laughing and I'm like he's a monster like he's at he's a monster of the local FBI yet another FBI agent who said something very bluntly of a child is missing for years either the child is dead or the child is not found and a fine that child and another country is extremely rare couch but you got to leave the possibility of finding the kid in another country impossible just doesn't make sense that never happened but she falls out of the she believes the story of venture so we'll get there till the next day back in Spain The Imposter the next day gets the actual color flyer of Nicholas Barclay who says I'm a fire at a children's home. How did he get it regardless he's like Okay so this kid is like a super teenager is 23 / white I'm super not white blond hair and blue eyes have dark hair and my kind of greenish gray eyes oh my God this is just not going to work as you know the only thing you hadn't come in with me was dead yet five fingers any chance have I said let's burn myself you know I burned a flyer and if I could have burned identity that I would meet this guy the ambassador to Spain or whatever and he's like girl we're coming to get you and this is just spiraling out of control and the imposters like I'm not in control of this anyway he takes off but at this point kind of like how you were saying like Okay so the news wasn't going to cover Nikolas Barclays disappearance but not at the US Embassy is involved there like an adorable white kid is missing hands on deck so the fact that the Imposter think that you can run and he gets for fee and the imposters told this wake me up the next morning and he's like oh fuck fuck now what am I going to do so he's like ocean then I realize you have courses sister's going to come and pick me up nothing like the I look nothing like her brother what am I going to do when she gets to Spain damn Coke there they've Coca-Cola we stopped for a Coca-Cola which I thought was really cool that coke there joke first episode coming back to you now and you said she was real cool like she's been through a lot but it's like across the country doesn't know what it entails can we drive to Spain and then they had soda their worst offense of them all to do notices she's smoking in the car all the way to the orphanage the entire way with the windows closed cuz she's like who am I looking for a dog in your up and okay so this is what Carrie tells us a little bit about Nicholas and Brooke I gave a lot of stuff a lot of gooks today is not a good kid daily run away before for a night or two mad at Mom I'm leaving I'll find a new mom a new home kiss my ass kind of thing and yeah when he would leave and she would let him down and find out where he is and he'd show up and next day he was not yeah this perfect nice suites Denison snooze a very Street Smart City boy seems very sweet he's calling his sister beautiful he's it like he was running the show though totally stab braking of a convenience store and stealing shoes and then he threatened a teacher with a knife his like hearing on it was this very day after he went missing so it's sort of a game that has been included like that story makes sense if you would run away Yeah Yeah Yeahs Harry gets to the home right and it's kind of cool cuz we're getting this story from Carrie perspective and also the imposters so great. Could we see me a picture and he's like I know she's here and I know that I like I'm going to have to see her at some point but I'm absolutely refusing to come out over I don't have to speak and the minute she sees me with my olive skin like them minute she sees me she's going to know I'm not her brother I like yeah she's super nervous and you know she's in a foreign country for the first time she's picking up her brother who she thinks it's been a sex slave for the last three years and she's saying like I saw him at the window and I waved like you saw who were the ones the best is that he finally knows he's got to come out of the room right I waited 10 minutes I knew I was about to lose everything dude I couldn't wait no more that I couldn't go away that I couldn't just disappear so I opened the door and I went now I'll I just had this image of my brain that he is like wrapped in the drapes from the room he's carrying the mattress on sunglasses asked if you can you can't see his face and it's like it's it freezing cold in Antarctica. How is dressed up within 1 second Terry has him in a hug and an Embrace I love you I see you I'm going to take you home I'm here to get you like I don't question to ask no questions and she is just like what and he says he's so like present it's all aware of what's happening cuz the Apostle says there was no other way she came for me and she was taking me back this is where it starts like split a little bit because of the whole next scene is about Harry taking him into like a visiting room and she's got all these family photos at you like this is your uncle so-and-so remember him this was your birthday remember that and she was told he doesn't remember anything right and so when you hear it from his perspective he's like she was coaching me she needed me to be necklace for X Y and Z reason that will get you later think about it from her perspective she's just being a loving sister who's like pulling his hand and trying to like refreshment she wants her little brother back so they're both kind of giving each other what they need in this moment I was like so funny I'm like Harry the woman I will say is that they both tell us the story about how she likes his nose Nicholas and you are afraid I wouldn't recognize you I would remember that knows so I just I remember touching his nose and telling him I remember that knows you kind of look like your Uncle Pat this guy has a very distinctive knows he's got a really big nose and she says you have the same nose just like Uncle Pat and it's like when you see pictures of Nicholas Barclay he does not have a yeah it's weird to the Imposter that she says that and she points out the nose and it's a very distinctive feature of this person who is definitely not in a glass of right it's weird and so we're at the point Carrie the sister and the embassy guy are vouching for Nicholas and it's definitely him just judge and the police and the prosecutors do not believe it's him because Citizen and they have to prove who he is part of the evidence that was in those interviews was a family photo album you're really Nicholas we got pictures here that you never send me all these questions about the photos the very same photos that carry just happened to teach him and she's like who's that who's that who's that and he gets four out of five rights on the fire stick Betty quest to light she was already convinced I was Nicholas Barclay like judge in Spain is like there's a can really you are who you are identify these five photos liked it just seems ridiculous want to be back in Portugal to Live Oak Florida over there are no rules and nothing makes any sense but it works if you got that you have passport and we see the passport we see the picture the next day they get on the plane and they're going home and we see the whole other side of the family the mom the cousin to a brother-in-law whatever they're all waiting for them at the airport also week at the actual home movies of him getting off the plane in the whole family is there till 4 18th 1997 it's like actual home. Play before him he's the last one to get off in like he comes off a plane looking like Michael Jackson wrapped up in scarves and hats dark sunglasses and the mom Beverly says the same room like yeah you change so much it said it was like mind-boggling then I realize you don't you tell yourself voice been through all this horrendous. So is absolutely going to be different and then she goes to hug him and he recoils and she's like wow this kids really messed up you know what really stuck out to me this time my thing is nobody in the family even mentions hey what happened are you okay don't even that like let's figure out what happened to you I didn't notice it the first time. Like let's bring this entity down hoody another boy and all the stuff totally it's another thing that makes the family looks super guilty that they know what happened I don't have to ask that question right cuz it really wouldn't wear their mind is there like let's hop in the car blast the goddamn Doobie Brothers and I don't know I fucking hate that song that's not used to me it gives me life take

I did this whole in Boston thing cuz I wanted to go to America cuz I thought it was all like a big city with a pointed when he wakes up there first morning in Texas play Survivor Eye it's as flat for as far as the eye can see they love the flatness of Texas they love to a big city in America they drive again don't ask any questions or try to get his mental health in check they just like take Nick around to go shopping and you know I do it yet to recognize some things her and that I also knew that I couldn't because I never been there before we met some people that do Nicola's before it disappeared I told them I didn't remember them there was something but I didn't remember them like I lost my memory which but I told him so now the townspeople are just like walking up and saying hello and he's relying on this like loss of memory bit and honestly you're a goddamn monster if you question it Jordy I saw there's an imposter who Supernaut Nick like they like everybody can tell that it's not him but you can't say there's some guy who's doing the worst impression of like someone undercover braids like he might as well have those glasses with the big nose in the mustache where it's like you obviously obviously don't want anyone to know who you are so now he finally meets Jason he's the older brother Debbie guy that moved in Nicholas was like hey can I get a ride home from basketball he was like No just walk exactly he comes home for like a visit and then buy it not for a second he didn't look at me like Nicholas Nicholas and you said good luck to me and you left I didn't pretend to Fox right now we just cut to Nancy from the FBI or love and she's like okay because she had said to them go get your brother but when you get him back here at the very first thing we have to do is interview him and find out what happened exactly do my job I'm dancing from the FBI God damn it I did not receive any telephone calls from the family saying you know Nicholas is back please come over and talk to us we need help and I felt like it was imperative that he be interviewed quickly and no one called again this more evidence of the family's guilt right because it's like it wouldn't you again be like we need to find out who did this even if they didn't have anything to do with his disappearance day just want the Imposter to be neck so at the very least they're not sure about that cuz the bottom of it is that this French 23 year old guy right Nancy meets The Imposter and she's like okay not that people can't change anything but this person in general did not appear to be 16 add a shadow of a beard a dark beard that I doubt if Nicholas would have had a shadow of a dark beard at the age of 16 since he had blond hair appeared to be quite nervous and he just seemed very uncomfortable this entire time fully convinced it is him I didn't give her a hero bail back and forth with it with the Nancy Grace is the worst somewhere closer to she's farthest away from Auntie Grace right she's not about being full Kerrigan hovering over the middle of making out like a measuring tape measure walking home from a sensible basketball game in San Antonio is my dick brother didn't wake up my mom to come get me that's ridiculous I love the garbage you give me a lot of play in the hundredths had to bring it back over sea that was abducted put in a band and fly over some places that I never knew where it was that kept in the room was different kits chloroformed and they wake up and they're you know a place they don't know where they're at it's not true but completely not true that picture he paints is absolutely terrifying ring of young boys who are being chloroformed and sexually abused nightly they were tortured their bones were broken they were experimented on they had needles in their eyes in this world like Nancy I probably conservative and Uncle when the new story that comes on Facebook seems ridiculous give it a go if it seems like this is a horrifying terrifying to be true it is probably not true about Nancy Fisher is that she's so traumatized by just having been told this story she literally walks out we can see her like holding her stomach and like she's like James Brown live on stage she's like a mineral water if you cook shelled to Ice Cube for water he said because he's like oh Nancy's fine as hook line so then he's like oh I was also forced to speak all these languages which is why I have an accent and if I spoke English to beat me and also I had to learn all these different identities which is why I don't remember any of my family and lastly the most importantly they dyed my eyes. Special solution how do they put needles through my eyes oh my God you guys it's just unbelievable she can't believe it how do you say get well thanks for helping us so what happened was is that as these people were torturing me and had control over me for three and a half years and needles in my eyes and nephew in her office do they shut up or now I don't know but but she's fully invested hand on the death of good thing the death of Andre she picked it up and slam that she doesn't have any time to plant a potato the needles in his eyes it's ridiculous submissive bated breath on the other he's like well after three and a half years of holding me hostage and doing these category horrible things to me I broke free and ran through one door and then another and then another and then another any ran through all of these like six door and then suddenly he was outside and realized he was in Spain and he didn't run and make a phone call himself I'm just like ran and took solace in a phone booth in the rain because maybe the Imposter was ever loved before but he saw movies just once in his life is everything good or tragic happens in the rain so he didn't say oh my God you won't believe what I just ran from police he waits for this Taurus are boats and his wife to not say a word about anything and Nancy is she has run out of napkins with a greasy popcorn this was a horrendous interview and when I left I was shaken by it because it had all the horrific emotional side effects that go with listening to such a story she believes the living shit out of the stories who would lie about this and I'm like an imposter or first day of your birthday because he's a victim if I was over there today, that's on with actor but now we can talk about Charlie Parker that's like not jazz legend Charlie Parker private investigator Charlie Parker hard copy to track this kid down cuz they want look of course it's hard copy they want to do like an exclusive interview with Nick last night he beats with Beverly Nicholas's mom and even though Nancy Nancy pulling your hair out Nancy Beggs family not to talk to the media Charlie Parker call dinapoli's I guess in 2 minutes I'm here now you want to come over so they paid for that you know they got money for that for sure so now we only gave permission that they can talk to the Imposter is my witness music then disappeared Without a Trace 3 years ago tonight is San Antonio boy is back home again your sunglasses hat scarf 15 layers boost it was almost faint behind that boost was a picture of the actual Nicholas Barclay and I could look at that picture and look at him at the same time and as I looked at the picture I noticed that the boy had blue gray looking eyes and this man had brown eyes he was a moment where the hair stood on the back your neck and it was just something wrong about it he's like blonde hair blue eyes teenager olive skin dark eyes 23 shadow look look I know the legend in my own mind but hey you can pull this off Charlie Parker this is not the right now there's only one way to get that because he has something to prove he was like look right about Scotland Yard using that method to trace down a man James Earl Ray that had killed Martin Luther King they caught him at Heathrow Airport by identifying his ears ears and the real Nikolas years do it at a diner like I got two pictures he goes I use the program called Adobe Photoshop and I assumed it in your so much it's basically DNA at this point what does like a butt Legend in my all my I'm calling ya what beers don't match that they just don't match it out when we going to do about a kid and bench play she's like well I don't know Charlie Parker Legend in your own mind the family says it's him so I really don't know what what me is the FBI can I do about this the family says it's him it's him and Charlie Parker his like again we got to do this we got to be swinging here Nancy is the one who pointed out the 5:00 shadow to tan skin to this point you think it's definitely Nicholas O'Charley don't interfere with a federal investigation right because she ever ever taken a stranger not just a stranger from this country but a stranger from another country who speaks with a French accent this has to be Nicholas Barclay why would you not just a stranger stranger from another country and not just a stranger from another country at the one with a French accent it has to be Nicholas Sparks Charlie Parker and I just have in my notes Nancy.

Com TCO tennis shoes on now the Imposter was 23 years old with a 5:00 shadow that's going to high school cuz why not cuz we're here now to become a kid again official sport to have a second chance to be able this time to go to school on 216th right totally starving like I'm going to live in the life of a 23 year old in high-school girls think I'm pretty handsome with a 5:00 shadow Nancy totally believes every goddamn word I say it's somewhere Charlie Parker is screaming at the top of his lungs in like some Camaro or whatever which I assume he's driving do something to Epping army base to the bottom of this once and for all cuz this is definitely Nicholas we're going to take him some forensic testing done me talk to Bruce Perry the Apostle comes in and sits down with this doctor for 5 seconds and the doctor said that there's no possible way between a class and as he spoke back immediately something in me just said this is not right this there's something wrong here cuz his basic point is there's no way that this kid could have grown up in an American household where they spoke English and not be able to speak without a foreign accent now it's just impossible she's like let me talk to you about some physiological reactions to trauma work like it so I can talk the talk but he's really not walking the walk but he sounded like eyes being dilated and things that happen when people are talking about trauma they've been through especially being like a sex slave with needles in your eyes and all the subtotal $100 an hour and I don't know who he is but the person who I was interviewing could not have been at this point I just showed up and I don't like that carry a be like you in danger girl bright and Nancy said something remember we were talking about Miss speaking like going across the country to Spain in 90 degree it just went from one place all the way up to another this case did a 90 degree and she's like Carrie where in Houston we're coming back do not be at the airport she's like 10 a stress it enough serious thing that ever happened now if that's not the case please I'm telling you I'm Nancy from the FBI do not show up to the airport. I won't be there we fly back into San Antonio they're scaring standing there what do shows at the airport like a dummy screaming at her on the phone begging her please do not show up this is a dangerous person because Nancy makes a little like a look when she sees Carrie say bye to me what did I just say literally Nancy like walks past the Imposter and Carrie and their reunions embracing call the US attorney's what do I do like okay alright just let him go like let's just like temporarily let's just see what happens and kind of like Trailhead because honestly like he hasn't done anything yet he clearly like just wants to be part of this family but with this family is also accepting him when it's so obvious he's not Nicholas like let's see what happens so now we also cut to carry though because Nancy is like screaming too much as she can. She's not screaming at all but she's like to welcome to this person home just like he was her brother I didn't have any clue as to why I should behave in this manner because in my conversation with her I had said this person is not your brother think I don't remember her putting it in those words I don't remember her putting it in those words exactly I don't like Carrie I know you're lying why are you lying but this guy needs to be her brother or they she knows her family killed her brother and it needs to be her brother see now I remember what I said earlier I only carry knows what really happened. Maybe I think I don't know why you're the best part of this whole thing this is my favorite part of our very first episode because Nancy is like you know there's one way to settle this once and for all I'm going to go to Nicholas house and get a DNA sample I know that will prove that it's not exactly next mom Beverly opens the door and according to Nancy not only did she refuse to give a DNA on the floor literally lay down on the floor and say no when you can't pick me up and you can't make me do not want to go I don't remember reviews be honest with you I really have no idea what I was thinking of that. Nancy finally woke up. She knows that they all know more they have to have something to hide why would they be doing this and so Charlie Parker the journey with me I really appreciate it he said you know a few months after Nicholas went missing remember the older brother Jason Jason the one that we think killed the cliff Jason called the police and told the police pay my brother who'd been missing for a few months he just tried to break into our house like this happens all the time when people kill family members they like a call in these false police reports about the family member and then there's never any evidence that makes sense to me because it like eight ellsworld and Nicholas is still alive and so now we get the Imposter saying all the pieces together Hustler's weirded out that Bev didn't want to give the DNA and also that Jason the older brother obviously knew that he wasn't Nicholas but didn't say anything good luck to you when you saying the killing some of them did it some of them some of them choose to North right cuz she's laying on the floor with me for what I have chilled mineral water whenever I want it I know you have to give you ever see them collect in the DNA but we do get fingerprints and so they get his fingerprints and they run the fingerprints and everybody was high-fiving it was just like and we file it we find out who this person is my heart was beating fast just like it is now thinking about it and then I said who are you some Frederic for Dean and I wanted by Interpol and we get this world 5-minute Montage of all of these different aliases all of the different places he's lived all of the different countries all of the names he's used to like this guy is fucking crazy exactly just keeps going on and on and on what we find out in this moment he gets arrested he was only with the Berkeley family for four and a half months I thought this went on for years now four and a half months and we see Cary and Kerry seems actually devastated the first filling was complete sadness because it wasn't Nicholas wish I was back to square one where is Nicholas us first one second emotion was how can I be so fucking stupid I mean seriously she's been through a lot but I truly don't think that she knows it really would happen to Nikolas but that moment when she's like I mean seriously inauthentic I love it so like they actually start questioning them on Beverly about like do you know what happened to him did you kill him I did not get my son I'm crazy but never violin sheet a lie detector test which you know I don't believe in houses two of them do it again running again until she fails and that she failed one but it's like Charlie Parker's like taking us to the house so it's so now the house that Nicholas grew up in is owned by somebody else other than all our friends or whoever they don't live there anymore or we meet the homeowner so now we're suddenly like with Charlie Parker and our new friend Darryl who's the owner of the house I think the boys buried here I want to talk to Daryl inside he's agreed to let me dig and see if Nicholas Barclay here so I get the sense of Charlie Parker call Darryl out of the Yellow Pages and was like here's what I think happened at your home do you think I can come by and down it was probably like going for next week like where you located at Charlie Parker's like I'm in the motel down the street how about like 6 a.m. tomorrow because Daryl is like it down even says he was like well when you told me about that last night on the phone and this happened to Charlie Parker has this theory that like Nick Barclay is buried in the backyard of this home but Daryl tells of it when I first moved in the dog use a bark all the time in the back corner of the yard and he would dig Nails Moen and saw pieces of plastic like material and Cat sticking out of the ground I try to pull it up to ripping arm is stuck on the ground by never paid any attention to it never gave it any thought until last night we were speaking on the phone don't think anything of it till our phone call last night I like to everyone if your dog digs up something and it's a tarp you call everybody yes you think about it right now. Until Charlie you don't wait till Charlie Parker not jazz legend legend is on my calls you if you're dumb things up a tarp you're like what the that's a bad scene Charlie Parker like how do you say for Charlie Parker's going to do it but it's just like aerial shot of like Daryl with a shirt off for behind think God digging Charlie Parker. Suit dress with arms folded watch it cuz you know if she's not she's not going herself this guy that got three or four feet down for some reason it's a game to dig up a dead body in the backyard 10 hours ago and Charlie Parker's like you've gone click in jail Connie Chung is interviewing him Frederick has a goddamn phone in his self where is this because it could even from behind bars he continue to lie to families of other missing children from this phone in his self or do you need hundreds of collect calls claiming to have information about lost children but he has a phone in a cell and he's no calling just like boo boo boo boo I just saying like do you have a missing kid on that kid like hundreds of time you get a phone in his cell I've literally never seen it before I kind of Cheung literally says like ellipsis all over the world what are you doing what are you doing the way she says what is the greatest what are you doing and that's it like they had opened a homicide investigation they closed it cuz they couldn't find anything Frederick at 6 years he tells us one more time before we leave him that all he cares about is himself we find out that he lives in France with his wife and three kids he has like a professional like fan page on Facebook has a Twitter account what he's like Out Among Us you guys and posturing we redid it sucks it really really yeah it was really fun you guys go listen to her first episode and tell us how it's different we have not listened to it already downloaded a week or that I have it's going to be so like a horrible to listen to oh my God you guys get two more chances to see this year Toronto in September and Brooklyn in October that Brooklyn shows with lamp to Tim and Maggie where's all that Maura Murray passport to get to both places I can't tell you if you're not just sitting there watching the show you a pound and a half Susan Cox Powell people have been asking for this for forever episode 2 episode did you also get the second one right at the same time and then it'll be the regular episode the following week.
